Views are (declarative) HTML that contain AngularJS <strong>directives</strong>. Directives set up the event handlers behind the scenes for us and give us dynamic databinding. Selectors are rarely used, so the need for IDs (and some types of classes) is greatly diminished. Views are tied to <strong>models</strong> (via scopes). Views are a projection of the model.

Don't design your page, and then change it with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model\">DOM</a> manipulations</h1>\n\n<p>In jQuery, you design a page, and then you make it dynamic. This is because jQuery was designed for augmentation and has grown incredibly from that simple premise.</p>\n\n<p>But in AngularJS, you must start from the ground up with your architecture in mind. Instead of starting by thinking \"I have this piece of the DOM and I want to make it do X\", you have to start with what you want to accomplish, then go about designing your application, and then finally go about designing your view.</p>\n\n<h1>2. Don't augment jQuery with AngularJS</h1>\n\n<p>Similarly, don't start with the idea that jQuery does X, Y, and Z, so I'll just add AngularJS on top of that for models and controllers. This is <em>really</em> tempting when you're just starting out, which is why I always recommend that new AngularJS developers don't use jQuery at all, at least until they get used to doing things the \"Angular Way\".</p>\n\n<p>I've seen many developers here and on the mailing list create these elaborate solutions with jQuery plugins of 150 or 200 lines of code that they then glue into AngularJS with a collection of callbacks and <code>$apply</code>s that are confusing and convoluted; but they eventually get it working! The problem is that in <strong>most</strong> cases that jQuery plugin could be rewritten in AngularJS in a fraction of the code, where suddenly everything becomes comprehensible and straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is this: when solutioning, first \"think in AngularJS\"; if you can't think of a solution, ask the community; if after all of that there is no easy solution, <em>then</em> feel free to reach for the jQuery. But don't let jQuery become a crutch or you'll never master AngularJS.</p>\n\n<h1>3. Always think in terms of architecture</h1>\n\n<p>First know that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\">single-page applications</a> are <em>applications</em>. They're <em>not</em> webpages. So we need to think like a server-side developer <em>in addition</em> to thinking like a client-side developer. We have to think about how to divide our application into individual, extensible, testable components.</p>\n\n<p>So then <em>how</em> do you do that? How do you \"think in AngularJS\"? Here are some general principles, contrasted with jQuery.</p>\n\n<h2>The view is the \"official record\"</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery, we programmatically change the view. We could have a dropdown menu defined as a <code>ul</code> like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"main-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#/home\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#/menu1\"&gt;Menu 1&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#/sm1\"&gt;Submenu 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#/sm2\"&gt;Submenu 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#/sm3\"&gt;Submenu 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#/home\"&gt;Menu 2&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In jQuery, in our application logic, we would activate it with something like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$('.main-menu').dropdownMenu();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When we just look at the view, it's not immediately obvious that there is any functionality here. For small applications, that's fine. But for non-trivial applications, things quickly get confusing and hard to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, though, the view is the official record of view-based functionality. Our <code>ul</code> declaration would look like this instead:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"main-menu\" dropdown-menu&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These two do the same thing, but in the AngularJS version anyone looking at the template knows what's supposed to happen. Whenever a new member of the development team comes on board, she can look at this and then <em>know</em> that there is a directive called <code>dropdownMenu</code> operating on it; she doesn't need to intuit the right answer or sift through any code. The view told us what was supposed to happen. Much cleaner.</p>\n\n<p>Developers new to AngularJS often ask a question like: how do I find all links of a specific kind and add a directive onto them. The developer is always flabbergasted when we reply: you don't. But the reason you don't do that is that this is like half-jQuery, half-AngularJS, and no good. The problem here is that the developer is trying to \"do jQuery\" in the context of AngularJS. That's never going to work well. The view <em>is</em> the official record. Outside of a directive (more on this below), you never, ever, <em>never</em> change the DOM. And directives are applied <em>in the view</em>, so intent is clear.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: don't design, and then mark up. You must architect, and then design.</p>\n\n<h2>Data binding</h2>\n\n<p>This is by far one of the most awesome features of AngularJS and cuts out a lot of the need to do the kinds of DOM manipulations I mentioned in the previous section. AngularJS will automatically update your view so you don't have to! In jQuery, we respond to events and then update content. Something like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$.ajax({\n  url: '/myEndpoint.json',\n  success: function ( data, status ) {\n    $('ul#log').append('&lt;li&gt;Data Received!&lt;/li&gt;');\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For a view that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"messages\" id=\"log\"&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Apart from mixing concerns, we also have the same problems of signifying intent that I mentioned before. But more importantly, we had to manually reference and update a DOM node. And if we want to delete a log entry, we have to code against the DOM for that too. How do we test the logic apart from the DOM? And what if we want to change the presentation?</p>\n\n<p>This a little messy and a trifle frail. But in AngularJS, we can do this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$http( '/myEndpoint.json' ).then( function ( response ) {\n    $scope.log.push( { msg: 'Data Received!' } );\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And our view can look like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"messages\"&gt;\n    &lt;li ng-repeat=\"entry in log\"&gt;{{ entry.msg }}&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But for that matter, our view could look like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;div class=\"messages\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"alert\" ng-repeat=\"entry in log\"&gt;\n        {{ entry.msg }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now instead of using an unordered list, we're using Bootstrap alert boxes. And we never had to change the controller code! But more importantly, no matter <em>where</em> or <em>how</em> the log gets updated, the view will change too. Automatically. Neat!</p>\n\n<p>Though I didn't show it here, the data binding is two-way. So those log messages could also be editable in the view just by doing this: <code>&lt;input ng-model=\"entry.msg\" /&gt;</code>. And there was much rejoicing.</p>\n\n<h2>Distinct model layer</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery, the DOM is kind of like the model. But in AngularJS, we have a separate model layer that we can manage in any way we want, completely independently from the view. This helps for the above data binding, maintains <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">separation of concerns</a>, and introduces far greater testability. Other answers mentioned this point, so I'll just leave it at that.</p>\n\n<h2>Separation of concerns</h2>\n\n<p>And all of the above tie into this over-arching theme: keep your concerns separate. Your view acts as the official record of what is supposed to happen (for the most part); your model represents your data; you have a service layer to perform reusable tasks; you do DOM manipulation and augment your view with directives; and you glue it all together with controllers. This was also mentioned in other answers, and the only thing I would add pertains to testability, which I discuss in another section below.</p>\n\n<h2>Dependency injection</h2>\n\n<p>To help us out with separation of concerns is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\">dependency injection</a> (DI). If you come from a server-side language (from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29\">Java</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP\">PHP</a>) you're probably familiar with this concept already, but if you're a client-side guy coming from jQuery, this concept can seem anything from silly to superfluous to hipster. But it's not. :-)</p>\n\n<p>From a broad perspective, DI means that you can declare components very freely and then from any other component, just ask for an instance of it and it will be granted. You don't have to know about loading order, or file locations, or anything like that. The power may not immediately be visible, but I'll provide just one (common) example: testing.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say in our application, we require a service that implements server-side storage through a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\">REST</a> API and, depending on application state, local storage as well. When running tests on our controllers, we don't want to have to communicate with the server - we're testing the <em>controller</em>, after all. We can just add a mock service of the same name as our original component, and the injector will ensure that our controller gets the fake one automatically - our controller doesn't and needn't know the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of testing...</p>\n\n<h1>4. Test-driven development - <em>always</em></h1>\n\n<p>This is really part of section 3 on architecture, but it's so important that I'm putting it as its own top-level section.</p>\n\n<p>Out of all of the many jQuery plugins you've seen, used, or written, how many of them had an accompanying test suite? Not very many because jQuery isn't very amenable to that. But AngularJS is.</p>\n\n<p>In jQuery, the only way to test is often to create the component independently with a sample/demo page against which our tests can perform DOM manipulation. So then we have to develop a component separately and <em>then</em> integrate it into our application. How inconvenient! So much of the time, when developing with jQuery, we opt for iterative instead of test-driven development. And who could blame us?</p>\n\n<p>But because we have separation of concerns, we can do test-driven development iteratively in AngularJS! For example, let's say we want a super-simple directive to indicate in our menu what our current route is. We can declare what we want in the view of our application:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;a href=\"/hello\" when-active&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Okay, now we can write a test for the non-existent <code>when-active</code> directive:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>it( 'should add \"active\" when the route changes', inject(function() {\n    var elm = $compile( '&lt;a href=\"/hello\" when-active&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;' )( $scope );\n\n    $location.path('/not-matching');\n    expect( elm.hasClass('active') ).toBeFalsey();\n\n    $location.path( '/hello' );\n    expect( elm.hasClass('active') ).toBeTruthy();\n}));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And when we run our test, we can confirm that it fails. Only now should we create our directive:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>.directive( 'whenActive', function ( $location ) {\n    return {\n        scope: true,\n        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {\n            scope.$on( '$routeChangeSuccess', function () {\n                if ( $location.path() == element.attr( 'href' ) ) {\n                    element.addClass( 'active' );\n                }\n                else {\n                    element.removeClass( 'active' );\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Our test now passes <em>and</em> our menu performs as requested. Our development is <em>both</em> iterative <em>and</em> test-driven. Wicked-cool.</p>\n\n<h1>5. Conceptually, directives are <em>not</em> packaged jQuery</h1>\n\n<p>You'll often hear \"only do DOM manipulation in a directive\". <strong>This is a necessity.</strong> Treat it with due deference!</p>\n\n<p>But let's dive a little deeper...</p>\n\n<p>Some directives just decorate what's already in the view (think <code>ngClass</code>) and therefore sometimes do DOM manipulation straight away and then are basically done. But if a directive is like a \"widget\" and has a template, it should <em>also</em> respect separation of concerns. That is, the template <em>too</em> should remain largely independent from its implementation in the link and controller functions.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS comes with an entire set of tools to make this very easy; with <code>ngClass</code> we can dynamically update the class; <code>ngModel</code> allows two-way data binding; <code>ngShow</code> and <code>ngHide</code> programmatically show or hide an element; and many more - including the ones we write ourselves. In other words, we can do all kinds of awesomeness <em>without</em> DOM manipulation. The less DOM manipulation, the easier directives are to test, the easier they are to style, the easier they are to change in the future, and the more re-usable and distributable they are.</p>\n\n<p>I see lots of developers new to AngularJS using directives as the place to throw a bunch of jQuery. In other words, they think \"since I can't do DOM manipulation in the controller, I'll take that code put it in a directive\". While that certainly is much better, it's often <em>still wrong</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the logger we programmed in section 3. Even if we put that in a directive, we <em>still</em> want to do it the \"Angular Way\". It <em>still</em> doesn't take any DOM manipulation! There are lots of times when DOM manipulation is necessary, but it's a <em>lot</em> rarer than you think! Before doing DOM manipulation <em>anywhere</em> in your application, ask yourself if you really need to. There might be a better way.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick example that shows the pattern I see most frequently. We want a toggleable button. (Note: this example is a little contrived and a skosh verbose to represent more complicated cases that are solved in exactly the same way.)</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>.directive( 'myDirective', function () {\n    return {\n        template: '&lt;a class=\"btn\"&gt;Toggle me!&lt;/a&gt;',\n        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {\n            var on = false;\n\n            $(element).click( function () {\n                on = !on;\n                $(element).toggleClass('active', on);\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are a few things wrong with this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First, jQuery was never necessary. There's nothing we did here that needed jQuery at all!</li>\n<li>Second, even if we already have jQuery on our page, there's no reason to use it here; we can simply use <code>angular.element</code> and our component will still work when dropped into a project that doesn't have jQuery.</li>\n<li>Third, even assuming jQuery <em>was</em> required for this directive to work, jqLite (<code>angular.element</code>) will <em>always</em> use jQuery if it was loaded! So we needn't use the <code>$</code> - we can just use <code>angular.element</code>.</li>\n<li>Fourth, closely related to the third, is that jqLite elements needn't be wrapped in <code>$</code> - the <code>element</code> that is passed to the <code>link</code> function would <em>already be</em> a jQuery element! </li>\n<li>And fifth, which we've mentioned in previous sections, why are we mixing template stuff into our logic?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This directive can be rewritten (even for very complicated cases!) much more simply like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>.directive( 'myDirective', function () {\n    return {\n        scope: true,\n        template: '&lt;a class=\"btn\" ng-class=\"{active: on}\" ng-click=\"toggle()\"&gt;Toggle me!&lt;/a&gt;',\n        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {\n            scope.on = false;\n\n            scope.toggle = function () {\n                scope.on = !scope.on;\n            };\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, the template stuff is in the template, so you (or your users) can easily swap it out for one that meets any style necessary, and the <strong>logic</strong> never had to be touched. Reusability - boom!</p>\n\n<p>And there are still all those other benefits, like testing - it's easy! No matter what's in the template, the directive's internal API is never touched, so refactoring is easy. You can change the template as much as you want without touching the directive. And no matter what you change, your tests still pass.</p>\n\n<p>w00t!</p>\n\n<p>So if directives aren't just collections of jQuery-like functions, what are they? Directives are actually <strong>extensions of HTML</strong>. If HTML doesn't do something you need it to do, you write a directive to do it for you, and then use it just as if it was part of HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, if AngularJS doesn't do something out of the box, think how the team would accomplish it to fit right in with <code>ngClick</code>, <code>ngClass</code>, et al.</p>\n\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n\n<p>Don't even use jQuery. Don't even include it. It will hold you back. And when you come to a problem that you think you know how to solve in jQuery already, before you reach for the <code>$</code>, try to think about how to do it within the confines the AngularJS. If you don't know, ask! 19 times out of 20, the best way to do it doesn't need jQuery and to try to solve it with jQuery results in more work for you.</p>\n", "title": "&quot;Thinking in AngularJS&quot; if I have a jQuery background?", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "angularjs", "design"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14994391/thinking-in-angularjs-if-i-have-a-jquery-background/15012542#15012542", "question_id": 14994391, "answer_id": 15012542}, {"body": "<p>They're apples and oranges.

FIND' where in the DOM you want to place this data, the '2. UPDATE/APPEND' it there by creating a new node or just setting its <a href=\"http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascript-innerHTML.php\">innerHTML</a>. Then when you want to update this view, you then '3. FIND' the location and '4. UPDATE'. This cycle of find and update all done within the same context of getting and formatting data from server is gone in AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>With AngularJS you have your model (JavaScript objects you are already used to) and the value of the model tells you about the model (obviously) and about the view, and an operation on the model automatically propagates to the view, so you don't have to think about it. You will find yourself in AngularJS no longer finding things in the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>To put in another way, in jQuery, you need to think about CSS selectors, that is, where is the <code>div</code> or <code>td</code> that has a class or attribute, etc., so that I can get their HTML or color or value, but in AngularJS, you will find yourself thinking like this: what model am I dealing with, I will set the model's value to true. You are not bothering yourself of whether the view reflecting this value is a checked box or resides in a <code>td</code> element (details you would have often needed to think about in jQuery).</p>\n\n<p>And with DOM manipulation in AngularJS, you find yourself adding directives and filters, which you can think of as valid HTML extensions.</p>\n\n<p>One more thing you will experience in AngularJS: in jQuery you call the jQuery functions a lot, in AngularJS, AngularJS will call your functions, so AngularJS will 'tell you how to do things', but the benefits are worth it, so learning AngularJS usually means learning what AngularJS wants or the way AngularJS requires that you present your functions and it will call it accordingly.

It's not a matter of \"How do I do what I used to in jQuery?\" as much as it's a matter of \"How do I supplement AngularJS with all of the stuff I used to do in jQuery?\"</p>\n\n<p>It's really two very different states of mind.</p>\n", "title": "&quot;Thinking in AngularJS&quot; if I have a jQuery background?", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "angularjs", "design"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14994391/thinking-in-angularjs-if-i-have-a-jquery-background/19863518#19863518", "question_id": 14994391, "answer_id": 19863518}, {"body": "<h1>jQuery</h1>\n\n<p>jQuery makes ridiculously long JavaScript commands like <code>getElementByHerpDerp</code> shorter and cross-browser.</p>\n\n<h1>AngularJS</h1>\n\n<p>AngularJS allows you to make your own HTML tags/attributes that do things which work well with dynamic web applications (since HTML was designed for static pages).</p>\n\n<h1>Edit:</h1>\n\n<p>Saying \"I have a jQuery background how do I think in AngularJS?\" is like saying \"I have an HTML background how do I think in JavaScript?\" The fact that you're asking the question shows you most likely don't understand the fundamental purposes of these two resources.

If you're coming from jQuery you may find some of the differences surprising. Angular may make you angry.</p>\n\n<p>This is normal, you should push through. Angular is worth it.</p>\n\n<h2>The big difference (TLDR)</h2>\n\n<p>jQuery gives you a toolkit for selecting arbitrary bits of the DOM and making ad-hoc changes to them. You can do pretty much anything you like piece by piece.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS instead gives you a <strong>compiler</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>What this means is that AngularJS reads your entire DOM from top to bottom and treats it as code, literally as instructions to the compiler. As it traverses the DOM, It looks for specific <strong>directives</strong> (compiler directives) that tell the AngularJS compiler how to behave and what to do. Directives are little objects full of JavaScript which can match against attributes, tags, classes or even comments. </p>\n\n<p>When the Angular compiler determines that a piece of the DOM matches a particular directive, it calls the directive function, passing it the DOM element, any attributes, the current $scope (which is a local variable store), and some other useful bits. These attributes may contain expressions which can be interpreted by the Directive, and which tell it how to render, and when it should redraw itself.</p>\n\n<p>Directives can then in turn pull in additional Angular components such as controllers, services, etc. What comes out the bottom of the compiler is a fully formed web application, wired up and ready to go.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This means that Angular is Template Driven</strong>. Your template drives the JavaScript, not the other way around. This is a radical reversal of roles, and the complete opposite of the unobtrusive JavaScript we have been writing for the last 10 years or so. This can take some getting used to.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds like it might be over-prescriptive and limiting, nothing could be farther from the truth. Because AngularJS treats your HTML as code, you get <strong>HTML level granularity in your web application</strong>. Everything is possible, and most things are surprisingly easy once you make a few conceptual leaps.</p>\n\n<p>Let's get down to the nitty gritty.</p>\n\n<h2>First up, Angular doesn't replace jQuery</h2>\n\n<p>Angular and jQuery do different things. AngularJS gives you a set of tools to produce web applications. jQuery mainly gives you tools for modifying the DOM. If jQuery is present on your page, AngularJS will use it automatically. If it isn't, AngularJS ships with jQuery Lite, which is a cut down, but still perfectly usable version of jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>Misko likes jQuery and doesn't object to you using it. However you will find as you advance that you can get a pretty much all of your work done using a combination of scope, templates and directives, and you should prefer this workflow where possible because your code will be more discrete, more configurable, and more Angular.</p>\n\n<p>If you do use jQuery, you shouldn't be sprinkling it all over the place. The correct place for DOM manipulation in AngularJS is in a directive. More on these later.</p>\n\n<h2>Unobtrusive JavaScript with Selectors vs. Declarative Templates</h2>\n\n<p>jQuery is typically applied unobtrusively. Your JavaScript code is linked in the header (or the footer), and this is the only place it is mentioned. We use selectors to pick out bits of the page and write plugins to modify those parts.</p>\n\n<p>The JavaScript is in control. The HTML has a completely independent existence. Your HTML remains semantic even without JavaScript. Onclick attributes are very bad practice.</p>\n\n<p>One of the first things your will notice about AngularJS is that <strong>custom attributes are everywhere</strong>. Your HTML will be littered with ng attributes, which are essentially onClick attributes on steroids. These are directives (compiler directives), and are one of the main ways in which the template is hooked to the model.</p>\n\n<p>When you first see this you might be tempted to write AngularJS off as old school intrusive JavaScript (like I did at first). In fact, AngularJS does not play by those rules. In AngularJS, your HTML5 is a template. It is compiled by AngularJS to produce your web page.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first big difference. To jQuery, your web page is a DOM to be manipulated. To AngularJS, your HTML is code to be compiled. AngularJS reads in your whole web page and literally compiles it into a new web page using its built in compiler.</p>\n\n<p>Your template should be declarative; its meaning should be clear simply by reading it. We use custom attributes with meaningful names. We make up new HTML elements, again with meaningful names. A designer with minimal HTML knowledge and no coding skill can read your AngularJS template and understand what it is doing. He or she can make modifications. <em>This is the Angular way.</em></p>\n\n<h2>The template is in the driving seat.</h2>\n\n<p>One of the first questions I asked myself when starting AngularJS and running through the tutorials is <strong>\"Where is my code?\"</strong>. I've written no JavaScript, and yet I have all this behaviour. The answer is obvious. Because AngularJS compiles the DOM, AngularJS is treating your HTML as code. For many simple cases it's often sufficient to just write a template and let AngularJS compile it into an application for you.</p>\n\n<p>Your template drives your application. It's treated as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language\">DSL</a>. You write AngularJS components, and AngularJS will take care of pulling them in and making them available at the right time based on the structure of your template. This is very different to a standard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">MVC</a> pattern, where the template is just for output.</p>\n\n<p>It's more similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT\">XSLT</a> than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails\">Ruby on Rails</a> for example.</p>\n\n<p>This is a radical inversion of control that takes some getting used to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stop trying to drive your application from your JavaScript. Let the template drive the application, and let AngularJS take care of wiring the components together. This also is the Angular way.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Semantic HTML vs. Semantic Models</h2>\n\n<p>With jQuery your HTML page should contain semantic meaningful content. If the JavaScript is turned off (by a user or search engine) your content remains accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Because AngularJS treats your HTML page as a template. The template is not supposed to be semantic as your content is typically stored in your model which ultimately comes from your API. AngularJS compiles your DOM with the model to produce a semantic web page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your HTML source is no longer semantic, instead, your API and compiled DOM are semantic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, meaning lives in the model, the HTML is just a template, for display only.</p>\n\n<p>At this point you likely have all sorts of questions concerning <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\">SEO</a> and accessibility, and rightly so. There are open issues here. Most screen readers will now parse JavaScript. Search engines can also index <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29\">AJAXed</a> content. Nevertheless, you will want to make sure you are using pushstate URLs and you have a decent sitemap. See here for a discussion of the issue: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/23245379/687677\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/23245379/687677</a></p>\n\n<h2>Separation of concerns (SOC) vs. MVC</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">Separation of concerns</a> (SOC) is a pattern that grew up over many years of web development for a variety of reasons including SEO, accessibility and browser incompatibility. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>HTML - Semantic meaning. The HTML should stand alone.</li>\n<li>CSS - Styling, without the CSS the page is still readable.</li>\n<li>JavaScript - Behaviour, without the script the content remains.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, AngularJS does not play by their rules. In a stroke, <strong>AngularJS does away with a decade of received wisdom</strong> and instead implements an MVC pattern in which the template is no longer semantic, not even a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Model - your models contains your semantic data. Models are usually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\">JSON</a> objects. Models exist as attributes of an object called $scope. You can also store handy utility functions on $scope which your templates can then access.</li>\n<li>View - Your views are written in HTML. The view is usually not semantic because your data lives in the model.</li>\n<li>Controller - Your controller is a JavaScript function which hooks the view to the model. Its function is to initialise $scope. Depending on your application, you may or may not need to create a controller. You can have many controllers on a page.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>MVC and SOC are not on opposite ends of the same scale, they are on completely different axes. SOC makes no sense in an AngularJS context. You have to forget it and move on.</p>\n\n<p>If, like me, you lived through the browser wars, you might find this idea quite offensive. Get over it, it'll be worth it, I promise.</p>\n\n<h2>Plugins vs. Directives</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Plugins extend jQuery. AngularJS Directives extend the capabilities of your browser.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In jQuery we define plugins by adding functions to the jQuery.prototype. We then hook these into the DOM by selecting elements and calling the plugin on the result. The idea is to extend the capabilities of jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want a carousel on your page, you might define an unordered list of figures, perhaps wrapped in a nav element. You might then write some jQuery to select the list on the page and restyle it as a gallery with timeouts to do the sliding animation.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, we define directives. A directive is a function which returns a JSON object. This object tells AngularJS what DOM elements to look for, and what changes to make to them. Directives are hooked in to the template using either attributes or elements, which you invent. The idea is to extend the capabilities of HTML with new attributes and elements.</p>\n\n<p><em>The AngularJS way is to extend the capabilities of native looking HTML.</em> You should write HTML that looks like HTML, extended with custom attributes and elements.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a carousel, just use a <code>&lt;carousel /&gt;</code> element, then define a directive to pull in a template, and make that sucker work.</p>\n\n<h2>Lots of small directives vs. big plugins with configuration switches</h2>\n\n<p>The tendency with jQuery is to write great big plugins like lightbox which we then configure by passing in numerous values and options.</p>\n\n<p>This is a mistake in AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>Take the example of a dropdown. When writing a dropdown plugin you might be tempted to code in click handlers, perhaps a function to add in a chevron which is either up or down, perhaps change the class of the unfolded element, show hide the menu, all helpful stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Until you want to make a small change.</p>\n\n<p>Say you have a menu that you want to unfold on hover. Well now we have a problem. Our plugin has wired in our click handler for us, we're going to need to add a configuration option to make it behave differently in this specific case.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS we write smaller directives. Our dropdown directive would be ridiculously small. It might maintain the folded state, and provide methods to fold(), unfold() or toggle(). These methods would simply update $scope.menu.visible which is a boolean holding the state.</p>\n\n<p>Now <strong>in our template</strong> we can wire this up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a ng-click=\"toggle()\"&gt;Menu&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;ul ng-show=\"menu.visible\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Need to update on mouseover?</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a ng-mouseenter=\"unfold()\" ng-mouseleave=\"fold()\"&gt;Menu&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;ul ng-show=\"menu.visible\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The template drives the application so we get HTML level granularity. If we want to make case by case exceptions, the template makes this easy.</p>\n\n<h2>Closure vs. $scope</h2>\n\n<p>JQuery plugins are created in a closure. Privacy is maintained within that closure. It's up to you to maintain your scope chain within that closure. You only really have access to the set of DOM nodes passed in to the plugin by jQuery, plus any local variables defined in the closure and any globals you have defined. This means that plugins are quite self contained. This is a good thing, but can get restrictive when creating a whole application. Trying to pass data between sections of a dynamic page becomes a chore.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS has $scope objects. These are special objects created and maintained by AngularJS in which you store your model. Certain directives will spawn a new $scope, which by default inherits from its wrapping $scope using JavaScript prototypical inheritance. The $scope object is accessible in the controller and the view.</p>\n\n<p>This is the clever part. Because the structure of $scope inheritance roughly follows the structure of the DOM, elements have access to their own scope, and any containing scopes seamlessly, all the way up to the global $scope (which is not the same as the global scope).</p>\n\n<p>This makes it much easier to pass data around, and to store data at an appropriate level. If a dropdown is unfolded, only the dropdown $scope needs to know about it. If the user updates their preferences, you might want to update the global $scope, and any nested scopes listening to the user preferences would automatically be alerted.</p>\n\n<p>This might sound complicated, in fact, once you relax into it, it's like flying. You don't need to create the $scope object, AngularJS instantiates and configures it for you, correctly and appropriately based on your template hierarchy. AngularJS then makes it available to your component using the magic of dependency injection (more on this later).</p>\n\n<h2>Manual DOM changes vs. Data Binding</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery you make all your DOM changes by hand. You construct new DOM elements programatically. If you have a JSON array and you want to put it to the DOM, you must write a function to generate the HTML and insert it.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS you can do this too, but you are encouraged to make use of data binding. Change your model, and because the DOM is bound to it via a template your DOM will automatically update, no intervention required.</p>\n\n<p>Because data binding is done from the template, using either an attribute or the curly brace syntax, it's super easy to do. There's little cognitive overhead associated with it so you'll find yourself doing it all the time.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input ng-model=\"user.name\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Binds the input element to <code>$scope.user.name</code>. Updating the input will update the value in your current scope, and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;\n  {{user.name}}\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will output the user name in a paragraph. It's a live binding, so if the <code>$scope.user.name</code> value is updated, the template will update too.</p>\n\n<h2>Ajax all of the time</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery making an Ajax call is fairly simple, but it's still something you might think twice about. There's the added complexity to think about, and a fair chunk of script to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, Ajax is your default go-to solution and it happens all the time, almost without you noticing. You can include templates with ng-include. You can apply a template with the simplest custom directive. You can wrap an Ajax call in a service and create yourself a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\">GitHub</a> service, or a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr\">Flickr</a> service, which you can access with astonishing ease.</p>\n\n<h2>Service Objects vs Helper Functions</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery, if we want to accomplish a small non-dom related task such as pulling a feed from an API, we might write a little function to do that in our closure. That's a valid solution, but what if we  want to access that feed often? What if we want to reuse that code in another application?</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS gives us service objects.</p>\n\n<p>Services are simple objects that contain functions and data. They are always singletons, meaning there can never be more than one of them. Say we want to access the Stack Overflow API, we might write a <code>StackOverflowService</code> which defines methods for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say we have a shopping cart. We might define a ShoppingCartService which maintains our cart and contains methods for adding and removing items. Because the service is a singleton, and is shared by all other components, any object that needs to can write to the shopping cart and pull data from it. It's always the same cart.</p>\n\n<p>Service objects are self-contained AngularJS components which we can use and reuse as we see fit. They are simple JSON objects containing functions and Data. They are always singletons, so if you store data on a service in one place, you can get that data out somewhere else just by requesting the same service.</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\">Dependency injection</a> (DI) vs. Instatiation - aka de-spaghettification</h2>\n\n<p>AngularJS manages your dependencies for you. If you want an object, simply refer to it and AngularJS will get it for you.</p>\n\n<p>Until you start to use this, it's hard to explain just what a massive time boon this is. Nothing like AngularJS DI exists inside jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>DI means that instead of writing your application and wiring it together, you instead define a library of components, each identified by a string.</p>\n\n<p>Say I have a component called 'FlickrService' which defines methods for pulling JSON feeds from Flickr. Now, if I want to write a controller that can access Flickr, I just need to refer to the 'FlickrService' by name when I declare the controller. AngularJS will take care of instantiating the component and making it available to my controller.</p>\n\n<p>For example, here I define a service:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myApp.service('FlickrService', function() {\n  return {\n    getFeed: function() { // do something here }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now when I want to use that service I just refer to it by name like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myApp.controller('myController', ['FlickrService', function(FlickrService) {\n  FlickrService.getFeed()\n}]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>AngularJS will recognise that a FlickrService object is needed to instantiate the controller, and will provide one for us.</p>\n\n<p>This makes wiring things together very easy, and pretty much eliminates any tendency towards spagettification. We have a flat list of components, and AngularJS hands them to us one by one as and when we need them.</p>\n\n<h2>Modular service architecture</h2>\n\n<p>jQuery says very little about how you should organise your code. AngularJS has opinions.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS gives you modules into which you can place your code. If you're writing a script that talks to Flickr for example, you might want to create a Flickr module to wrap all your Flickr related functions in. Modules can include other modules (DI). Your main application is usually a module, and this should include all the other modules your application will depend on.</p>\n\n<p>You get simple code reuse, if you want to write another application based on Flickr, you can just include the Flickr module and voila, you have access to all your Flickr related functions in your new application.</p>\n\n<p>Modules contain AngularJS components. <strong>When we include a module, all the components in that module become available to us as a simple list identified by their unique strings</strong>. We can then inject those components into each other using AngularJS's dependency injection mechanism.</p>\n\n<h2>To sum up</h2>\n\n<p>AngularJS and jQuery are not enemies. It's possible to use jQuery within AngularJS very nicely. If you're using AngularJS well (templates, data-binding, $scope, directives, etc.) you will find you need a <strong>lot</strong> less jQuery than you might otherwise require.</p>\n\n<p>The main thing to realise is that your template drives your application. Stop trying to write big plugins that do everything. Instead write little directives that do one thing, then write a simple template to wire them together.</p>\n\n<p>Think less about unobtrusive JavaScript, and instead think in terms of HTML extensions.</p>\n\n<h2>My little book</h2>\n\n<p>I got so excited about AngularJS, I wrote a short book on it which you're very welcome to read online <a href=\"http://nicholasjohnson.com/angular-book/\">http://nicholasjohnson.com/angular-book/</a>.

JQuery is a client side library that play around the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJs Cool Principle - If you want some changes on your UI think from model data change perspective. Change your data and UI will re-render itself. You need not to play around DOM each time unless and until it is hardly required and that should also be handled through Angular Directives.</p>\n\n<p>To answer this question, I want to share my experience on the first enterprise application with AngularJS. These are the most awesome features that Angular provide where we start changing our jQuery mindset and we get the Angular like a framework and not the library.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Two-way data binding is amazing:</strong> \nI had a grid with all functionality UPDATE, DELTE, INSERT. I have a data object that binds the grid's model using ng-repeat. You only need to write a single line of simple JavaScript code for delete and insert and that's it. grid automatically updates as the grid model changes instantly. Update functionality is real time, no code for it.\nYou feel amazing!!!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Reusable directives are super:</strong>\nWrite directives in one place and use it throughout the application. OMG!!! I used these directive for paging, regex, validations, etc. It is really cool!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Routing is strong:</strong>\nIt's up to your implementation how you want to use it, but it requires very few lines of code to route the request to specify HTML and controller (JavaScript)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Controllers are great:</strong>\nControllers take care of their own HTML, but this separation works well for common functionality well as. If you want to call the same function on the click of a button on master HTML, just write the same function name in each controller and write individual code.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Plugins:</strong>\nThere are many other similar features like showing an overlay in your app. You don't need to write code for it, just use an overlay plugin available as wc-overlay, and this will automatically take care of all <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest\" rel=\"nofollow\">XMLHttpRequest</a> (XHR) requests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ideal for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services\" rel=\"nofollow\">RESTful</a> architecture:</strong>\nBeing a complete frameworks makes AngularJS great to work with a RESTful architecture. To call REST CRUD APIs is very easier and </p>\n\n<p><strong>Services</strong>: Write common codes using services and less code in controllers. Sevices can be used to share common functionalities among the controllers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Extensibility</strong>: Angular has extended the HTML directives using angular directives. Write expressions inside html and evaluate them on runtime.

Can multiple humans match the socks faster?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The simplest parallization strategy is to have multiple workers take from the input basket and put the socks onto the piles. This only scales up so much - imagine 100 people fighting over 10 piles. <strong>The synchronization costs</strong> (manifesting themselves as hand-collisions and human communication) <strong>destroy efficiency and speed-up</strong> (see the <a href=\"http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html\">Universal Scalability Law</a>!). Is this prone to <strong>deadlocks</strong>? No, because each worker only needs to access one pile at a time. With just one \"lock\" there cannot be a deadlock. <strong>Livelocks</strong> might be possible depending on how the humans coordinate access to piles. They might just use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff\">random backoff</a> like network cards do that on a physical level to determine what card can exclusively access the network wire. If it works for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller\">NICs</a>, it should work for humans as well.</li>\n<li>It scales nearly indefinitely if <strong>each worker has its own set of piles</strong>. Workers can then take big chunks of socks from the input basket (very little contention as they are doing it rarely) and they do not need to synchronise when distributing the socks at all (because they have thread-local piles). At the end, all workers need to union their pile-sets. I believe that can be done in O(log (worker count * piles per worker)) if the workers form an <strong>aggregation tree</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem\">element distinctness problem</a>? As the article states, the element distinctness problem can be solved in <code>O(N)</code>. This is the same for the socks problem (also <code>O(N)</code>, if you need only one distribution step (I proposed multiple steps only because humans are bad at calculations - one step is enough if you distribute on <code>md5(color, length, pattern, ...)</code>, i.e. a <strong>perfect hash</strong> of all attributes)).</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, one cannot go faster than <code>O(N)</code>, so we have reached the <strong>optimal lower bound</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Although the outputs are not exactly the same (in one case, just a boolean.

(Counting 2 seconds it will take you 2 min).</p>\n\n<p>The initial bucket sorting will speed up your process, because it divides your n socks into k buckets in <code>c*n</code> time so than you will only have to do <code>c*n*log(k)</code> work. (Not taking into account the threshold). So all in all you do about <code>n*c*(1 + log(k))</code> work, where c is the time to throw a sock on a pile.</p>\n\n<p>This approach will be favourable compared to any <code>c*x*n + O(1)</code> method roughly as long as <code>log(k) &lt; x - 1</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In computer science this can be helpful:\nWe have a collection of n <em>things</em>, an order on them (length) and also an equivalence relation (extra information, for example the color of socks). The equivalence relation allows us to make a partition of the original collection, and in every equivalence class our order is still maintained. The mapping of a <em>thing</em> to it's equivalence class can be done in O(1), so only O(n) is needed to assign each item to a class. Now we have used our extra information and can proceed in any manner to sort every class. The advantage is that the data sets are already significantly smaller.</p>\n\n<p>The method can also be nested, if we have multiple equivalence relations -> make colour piles, than within every pile partition on texture, than sort on length. Any equivalence relation that creates a partition with more than 2 elements that have about even size will bring a speed improvement over sorting (provided we can directly assign a sock to its pile), and the sorting can happen very quickly on smaller data sets.</p>\n", "title": "How to pair socks from a pile efficiently?", "tags": ["algorithm", "sorting", "language-agnostic", "matching"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14415881/how-to-pair-socks-from-a-pile-efficiently/14425958#14425958", "question_id": 14415881, "answer_id": 14425958}, {"body": "<p>Here's an Omega(n log n) lower bound in comparison based model.

That is, let's say there are two pairs of black men socks PairA and PairB, and each socks are named PairA-L, PairA-R, PairB-L, PairB-R. So PairA-L can be paired with PairB-R, but PairA-L and PairB-L cannot be paired.</em></p>\n\n<p>Let say any sock can be uniqly identified by,</p>\n\n<p><code>Attribute[Gender] + Attribute[Colour] + Attribute[Material] + Attribute[Type1] + Attribute[Type2] + Attribute[Left_or_Right]</code></p>\n\n<p>This is our first hash function. Let's use a short notation for this <code>h1(G_C_M_T1_T2_LR)</code>. <strong>h1(x)</strong> is not our location key.</p>\n\n<p>Another hash function eliminating the Left_or_Right attribute would be <code>h2(G_C_M_T1_T2)</code>.

This means we would have no other choice but to do a linear search to find a pair.</p>\n\n<p>Spreading them on the floor gives more visibility which improves the chance of spotting the matching sock (matching a haskey). \nWhen a sock was placed on the floor in step 3, our mind had subconciously registered the location. \n  - So in case this location is available in our memory we can directly find the matching pair.\n  - In case the location is not remembered, don't worry, then we can always revert back to linear search.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it important to remove the pair from the floor?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Short-term human memory works best when it has fewer items to remember. Thus increasing the probability of us resorting to hashing to spot the pair. </li>\n<li>It will also reduce the number of items to be searched through when linear searching for pair is being used.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Case 1: Worst case when Derpina cannot remember or spot the socks on the floor directly using the hashing technique. Derp does a linear search through the items on the floor. This is not worse than the iterating throught the pile to find the pair.\n<ul>\n<li>Upper bound for comparison: O(n^2).</li>\n<li>Lower bound for comparison: (n/2). (when every other sock Derpina picks up is the pair of previous one).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Case 2: Derp remembers each the location of every sock that he placed on the floor and each sock has exactly one pair.\n<ul>\n<li>Upper bound for comparison: O(n/2).</li>\n<li>Lower bound for comparison: O(n/2).</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am talking about comparison operations, picking the socks from the pile would necessarily be n number of operations. So a practical lower bound would be n iterations with n/2 comparisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speeding up things</strong></p>\n\n<p>To achieve a perfect score so Derp gets O(n/2) comparisons, I would recommend Derpina to,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>spend more time with the socks to get familiarize with it.

For example, the concept of \"red car\" maps to all the red cars a person is capable of remembering. Someone with a perfect memory has a perfect mapping.  Most people are imperfect in this regard (and most others).  The associative map has a limited capacity. Mappings may <em>bleep</em> out of existence under various circumstances (one beer too many), be recorded in error (\"I though her name was Betty, not Nettie\"), or never be overwritten even though we observe that the truth has changed (\"dad's car\" evokes \"orange Firebird\" when we actually knew he'd traded that in for the red Camaro).</p>\n\n<p>In the case of socks, perfect recall means looking at a sock <code>s</code> always produces the memory of its sibling <code>t</code>, including enough information (where it is on the ironing board) to locate <code>t</code> in constant time.  A person with photographic memory accomplishes both 1 and 2 in constant time without fail.</p>\n\n<p>Someone with less than perfect memory might use a few commonsense equivalence classes based on features within his capability to track: size (papa, mama, baby), color (greenish, redish, etc.), pattern (argyle, plain, etc.), style (footie, knee-high, etc.).  So the ironing board would be divided into sections for the categories. This usually allows the category to be located in constant time by memory, but then a linear search through the category \"bucket\" is needed. </p>\n\n<p>Someone with no memory or imagination at all (sorry) will just keep the socks in one pile and do a linear search of the whole pile.</p>\n\n<p>A neat freak might use numeric labels for pairs as someone suggested.  This opens the door to a total ordering, which allows the human to use exactly the same algorithms we might with a CPU: binary search, trees, hashes, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So the \"best\" algorithm depends on the qualities of the wetware/hardware/software that is running it and our willingness to \"cheat\" by imposing a total order on pairs.  Certainly a \"best\" <em>meta</em>-algorithm is to hire the worlds best sock-sorter: a person or machine that can aquire and quickly store a huge set N of sock attribute sets in a 1-1 associative memory with constant time lookup, insert, and delete. Both people and machines like this can be procured. If you have one, you can pair all the socks in O(N) time for N pairs, which is optimal.

Compiling the answers:</p>\n\n<h1>Services</h1>\n\n<p>Syntax: <code>module.service( 'serviceName', function );</code> <br/>\nResult: When declaring serviceName as an injectable argument <strong>you will be provided with an instance of the function. In other words</strong> <code>new FunctionYouPassedToService()</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>Factories</h1>\n\n<p>Syntax: <code>module.factory( 'factoryName', function );</code> <br/>\nResult: When declaring factoryName as an injectable argument you will be provided with <strong>the value that is returned by invoking the function reference passed to module.factory</strong>.</p>\n\n<h1>Providers</h1>\n\n<p>Syntax: <code>module.provider( 'providerName', function );</code> <br/>\nResult: When declaring providerName as an injectable argument <strong>you will be provided with</strong> <code>(new ProviderFunction()).$get()</code>. The constructor function is instantiated before the $get method is called - <code>ProviderFunction</code> is  the function reference passed to module.provider.</p>\n\n<p>Providers have the advantage that they can be configured during the module configuration phase.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/ohamub/1/edit\">here</a> for the provided code.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a great further explanation by Misko:</p>\n\n<pre><code>provide.value('a', 123);\n\nfunction Controller(a) {\n  expect(a).toEqual(123);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case the injector simply returns the value as is. But what if you want to compute the value? Then use a factory</p>\n\n<pre><code>provide.factory('b', function(a) {\n  return a*2;\n});\n\nfunction Controller(b) {\n  expect(b).toEqual(246);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So <code>factory</code> is a function which is responsible for creating the value. Notice that the factory function can ask for other dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>But what if you want to be more OO and have a class called Greeter?</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Greeter(a) {\n  this.greet = function() {\n    return 'Hello ' + a;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then to instantiate you would have to write</p>\n\n<pre><code>provide.factory('greeter', function(a) {\n  return new Greeter(a);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we could ask for 'greeter' in controller like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>function Controller(greeter) {\n  expect(greeter instanceof Greeter).toBe(true);\n  expect(greeter.greet()).toEqual('Hello 123');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But that is way too wordy. A shorter way to write this would be <code>provider.service('greeter', Greeter);</code></p>\n\n<p>But what if we wanted to configure the <code>Greeter</code> class before the injection? Then we could write</p>\n\n<pre><code>provide.provider('greeter2', function() {\n  var salutation = 'Hello';\n  this.setSalutation = function(s) {\n    salutation = s;\n  }\n\n  function Greeter(a) {\n    this.greet = function() {\n      return salutation + ' ' + a;\n    }\n  }\n\n  this.$get = function(a) {\n    return new Greeter(a);\n  };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then we can do this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('abc', []).config(function(greeter2Provider) {\n  greeter2Provider.setSalutation('Halo');\n});\n\nfunction Controller(greeter2) {\n  expect(greeter2.greet()).toEqual('Halo 123');\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a side note, <code>service</code>, <code>factory</code>, and <code>value</code> are all derived from provider.</p>\n\n<pre><code>provider.service = function(name, Class) {\n  provider.provide(name, function() {\n    this.$get = function($injector) {\n      return $injector.instantiate(Class);\n    };\n  });\n}\n\nprovider.factory = function(name, factory) {\n  provider.provide(name, function() {\n    this.$get = function($injector) {\n      return $injector.invoke(factory);\n    };\n  });\n}\n\nprovider.value = function(name, value) {\n  provider.factory(name, function() {\n    return value;\n  });\n};\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15666048/angularjs-service-vs-provider-vs-factory/15666049#15666049", "question_id": 15666048, "answer_id": 15666049}, {"body": "<p>I noticed something interesting when playing around with providers.</p>\n\n<p>Visibility of injectables is different for providers than it is for services and factories.

If you haven\u2019t had much experience using promises in AngularJS, I highly recommend doing a deep dive on them.</p>\n\n<p>Below <strong>setArtist</strong> accepts an artist and allows you to set the artist. <strong>getArtist</strong> returns the artist. <strong>callItunes</strong> first calls makeUrl() in order to build the URL we\u2019ll use with our $http request. Then it sets up a promise object, makes an $http request with our final url, then because $http returns a promise, we are able to call .success or .error after our request. We then resolve our promise with the iTunes data, or we reject it with a message saying \u2018There was an error\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory('myFactory', function($http, $q){\n  var service = {};\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  service.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  service.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  service.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n  return service;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now our factory is complete. We are now able to inject \u2018myFactory\u2019 into any controller and we\u2019ll then be able to call our methods that we attached to our service object (setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myFactoryCtrl', function($scope, myFactory){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the controller above we\u2019re injecting in the \u2018myFactory\u2019 service. We then set properties on our $scope object with data from \u2018myFactory\u2019. The only tricky code above is if you\u2019ve never dealt with promises before. Because callItunes is returning a promise, we are able to use the .then() method and only set $scope.data.artistData once our promise is fulfilled with the iTunes data. You\u2019ll notice our controller is very \u2018thin\u2019 (This is a good coding practise). All of our logic and persistent data is located in our service, not in our controller.\n<br><br>\n<strong>2) Service</strong> <br>\nPerhaps the biggest thing to know when dealing with creating a Service is that that it\u2019s instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. For you JavaScript gurus this should give you a big hint into the nature of the code. For those of  you with a limited background in JavaScript or for those who aren\u2019t too familiar with what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword actually does, let\u2019s review some JavaScript fundamentals that will eventually help us in understanding the nature of a Service.</p>\n\n<p>To really see the changes that occur when you invoke a function with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, let\u2019s create a function and invoke it with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, then let\u2019s show what the interpreter does when it sees the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. The end results will both be the same.</p>\n\n<p>First let\u2019s create our Constructor.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a typical JavaScript constructor function. Now whenever we invoke the Person function using the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, \u2018this\u2019 will be bound to the newly created object.</p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s add a method onto our Person\u2019s prototype so it will be available on every instance of our Person \u2018class\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert(\u2018My name is \u2018 + this.name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, because we put the sayName function on the prototype, every instance of Person will be able to call the sayName function in order alert that instance\u2019s name.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we have our Person constructor function and our sayName function on its prototype, let\u2019s actually create an instance of Person then call the sayName function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var tyler = new Person(\u2018Tyler\u2019, 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts \u2018My name is Tyler\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So all together the code for creating a Person constructor, adding a function to it\u2019s prototype, creating a Person instance, and then calling the function on its prototype looks like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\nPerson.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert(\u2018My name is \u2018 + this.name);\n}\nvar tyler = new Person(\u2018Tyler\u2019, 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts \u2018My name is Tyler\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s look at what actually is happening when you use the \u2018new\u2019 keyword in JavaScript. First thing you should notice is that after using \u2018new\u2019 in our example, we\u2019re able to call a method (sayName) on \u2018tyler\u2019 just as if it were an object - that\u2019s because it is. \nSo first, we know that our Person constructor is returning an object, whether we can see that in the code or not. Second, we know that because our sayName function is located on the prototype and not directly on the Person instance, the object that the Person function is returning must be delegating to its prototype on failed lookups. In more simple terms, when we call tyler.sayName() the interpreter says \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to look on the \u2018tyler\u2019 object we just created, locate the sayName function, then call it. Wait a minute, I don\u2019t see it here - all I see is name and age, let me check the prototype. Yup, looks like it\u2019s on the prototype, let me call it.\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Below is code for how you can think about what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword is actually doing in JavaScript. It\u2019s basically a code example of the above paragraph. I\u2019ve put the \u2018interpreter view\u2019 or the way the interpreter sees the code inside of notes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  //The below line creates an object(obj) that will delegate to the person\u2019s prototype on failed lookups.\n  //var obj = Object.create(Person.prototype);\n\n  //The line directly below this sets \u2018this\u2019 to the newly created object\n  //this = obj;\n\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n\n  //return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now having this knowledge of what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword really does in JavaScript, creating a Service in AngularJS should be easier to understand.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing to understand when creating a Service is knowing that Services are instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. Combining that knowledge with our examples above, you should now recognize that you\u2019ll be attaching your properties and methods directly to \u2018this\u2019 which will then be returned from the Service itself. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike what we originally did with the Factory example, we don\u2019t need to create an object then return that object because, like mentioned many times before, we used the \u2018new\u2019 keyword so the interpreter will create that object, have it delegate to it\u2019s prototype, then return it for us without us having to do the work.</p>\n\n<p>First things first, let\u2019s create our \u2018private\u2019 and helper function. This should look very familiar since we did the exact same thing with our factory. I won\u2019t explain what each line does here because I did that in the factory example, if you\u2019re confused, re-read the factory example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we\u2019ll attach all of our methods that will be available in our controller to \u2018this\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  this.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  this.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  this.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now just like in our factory, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be available in whichever controller we pass myService into. Here\u2019s the myService controller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory controller).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myServiceCtrl', function($scope, myService){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myService.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myService.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like I mentioned before, once you really understand what \u2018new\u2019 does, Services are almost identical to factories in AngularJS.\n<br><br>\n<strong>3) Provider</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing to remember about Providers is that they\u2019re the only service that you can pass into the app.config portion of your application. This is of huge importance if you\u2019re needing to alter some portion of your service object before it\u2019s available everywhere else in your application. Although very similar to Services/Factories, there are a few differences which we\u2019ll discuss.</p>\n\n<p>First we set up our Provider in a similar way we did with our Service and Factory. The variables below are our \u2018private\u2019 and helper function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.provider('myProvider', function(){\n   var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  //Going to set this property on the config function below.\n  this.thingFromConfig = \u2018\u2019;\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>*Again if any portion of the above code is confusing, check out the Factory section where I explain what it all does it greater details.</p>\n\n<p>You can think of Providers as having three sections. The first section is the \u2018private\u2019 variables/functions that will be modified/set later (shown above). The second section is the variables/functions that will be available in your app.config function and are therefore available to alter before they\u2019re available anywhere else (also shown above). It\u2019s important to note that those variables need to be attached to the \u2018this\u2019 keyword. In our example, only \u2018thingFromConfig\u2019 will be available to alter in the app.config. The third section (shown below) is all the variables/functions that will be available in your controller when you pass in the \u2018myProvider\u2019 service into that specific controller.</p>\n\n<p>When creating a service with Provider, the only properties/methods that will be available in your controller are those properties/methods which are returned from the $get() function. The code below puts $get on \u2018this\u2019 (which we know will eventually be returned from that function). Now, that $get function returns all the methods/properties we want to be available in the controller. Here\u2019s a code example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.$get = function($http, $q){\n    return {\n      callItunes: function(){\n        makeUrl();\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n        $http({\n          method: 'JSONP',\n          url: _finalUrl\n        }).success(function(data){\n          deferred.resolve(data);\n        }).error(function(){\n          deferred.reject('There was an error')\n        })\n        return deferred.promise;\n      },\n      setArtist: function(artist){\n        _artist = artist;\n      },\n      getArtist: function(){\n        return _artist;\n      },\n      thingOnConfig: this.thingFromConfig\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the full Provider code looks like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.provider('myProvider', function(){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  //Going to set this property on the config function below\n  this.thingFromConfig = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  this.$get = function($http, $q){\n    return {\n      callItunes: function(){\n        makeUrl();\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n        $http({\n          method: 'JSONP',\n          url: _finalUrl\n        }).success(function(data){\n          deferred.resolve(data);\n        }).error(function(){\n          deferred.reject('There was an error')\n        })\n        return deferred.promise;\n      },\n      setArtist: function(artist){\n        _artist = artist;\n      },\n      getArtist: function(){\n        return _artist;\n      },\n      thingOnConfig: this.thingFromConfig\n    }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now just like in our factory and Service, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be available in whichever controller we pass myProvider into. Here\u2019s the myProvider controller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory/Service controller).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myProviderCtrl', function($scope, myProvider){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myProvider.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myProvider.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n\n  $scope.data.thingFromConfig = myProvider.thingOnConfig;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, the whole point of creating a service with Provider is to be able to alter some variables through the app.config function before the final object is passed to the rest of the application. Let\u2019s see an example of that.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.config(function(myProviderProvider){\n  //Providers are the only service you can pass into app.config\n  myProviderProvider.thingFromConfig = 'This sentence was set in app.config. Providers are the only service that can be passed into config. Check out the code to see how it works';\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can see how \u2018thingFromConfig\u2019 is as empty string in our provider, but when that shows up in the DOM, it will be \u2018This sentence was set\u2026\u2019.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15666048/angularjs-service-vs-provider-vs-factory/23683176#23683176", "question_id": 15666048, "answer_id": 23683176}, {"body": "<p>My understanding is very simple below. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Factory:</strong>\n  You simply create an object inside of the factory and return it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Service:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You just have a standard function that uses this keyword to define a function.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provider:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a <code>$get</code> object that you define and it can be used to get the object that returns data.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15666048/angularjs-service-vs-provider-vs-factory/24053985#24053985", "question_id": 15666048, "answer_id": 24053985}, {"body": "<p><strong>Service vs provider vs factory:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to keep it simple. It's all about basic JavaScript concept.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, let's talk about <strong>services</strong> in AngularJS!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Service:</strong>\nIn AngularJS, <strong>Service</strong> is nothing but a singleton JavaScript object which can store some useful methods or properties. This singleton object is created per ngApp(Angular app) basis and it is shared among all the controllers within current app. When Angularjs instantiate a service object, it register this service object with a unique service name. So each time when we need service instance, Angular search the registry for this service name, and it returns the reference to service object. Such that we can invoke method, access properties etc on the service object.\nYou may have question whether you can also put properties, methods on scope object of controllers! So why you need service object? Answers is: services are shared among multiple controller scope. If you put some properties/methods in a controller's scope object , it will be available to current scope only. But when you define methods, properties on service object, it will be available globally and can be accessed in any  controller's scope by injecting that service.</p>\n\n<p>So if there are three controller scope, let it be controllerA, controllerB and controllerC, all will share same service instance.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller='controllerA'&gt;\n    &lt;!-- controllerA scope --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div ng-controller='controllerB'&gt;\n    &lt;!-- controllerB scope --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div ng-controller='controllerC'&gt;\n    &lt;!-- controllerC scope --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>How to create a service?</strong></p>\n\n<p>AngularJS provide different methods to register a service. Here we will concentrate on three methods factory(..),service(..),provider(..);</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsbin.com/vaken/16/edit?html,js,output\">Use this link for code reference</a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Factory function:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We can define a factory function as below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>factory('serviceName',function fnFactory(){ return serviceInstance;})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>AngularJS provides <strong>'factory('serviceName', fnFactory)'</strong> method which takes two parameter, serviceName and a JavaScript function. Angular creates service instance by invoking the function <strong>fnFactory()</strong> such as below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var serviceInstace = fnFactory();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The passed function can define a object and return that object. AngularJS simply stores this object reference to a variable which is passed as first argument. Anything which is returned from fnFactory will be bound to serviceInstance . Instead of returning object , we can also return function, values etc, Whatever we will return , will be available to service instance.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var app= angular.module('myApp', []);\n//creating service using factory method\napp.factory('factoryPattern',function(){\n  var data={\n    'firstName':'Tom',\n    'lastName':' Cruise',\n    greet: function(){\n      console.log('hello!' + this.firstName + this.lastName);\n    }\n  };\n\n  //Now all the properties and methods of data object will be available in our service object\n  return data;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Service Function:</h2>\n\n<pre><code>service('serviceName',function fnServiceConstructor(){})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's the another way, we can register a service. The only difference is the way AngularJS tries to instantiate the service object. This time angular uses 'new' keyword and call the constructor function something like below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var serviceInstance = new fnServiceConstructor();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the constructor function we can use 'this' keyword for adding properties/methods to the service object.\nexample:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Creating a service using the service method\nvar app= angular.module('myApp', []);\napp.service('servicePattern',function(){\n  this.firstName ='James';\n  this.lastName =' Bond';\n  this.greet = function(){\n    console.log('My Name is '+ this.firstName + this.lastName);\n  };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2><strong>Provider function:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Provider() function is the another way for creating services. Let we are interested to create a service which just display some greeting message to the user. But we also want to provide a functionality such that user can set their own greeting message. In technical terms we want to create configurable services. How can we do this ? There must be a way, so that app could pass their custom greeting messages and Angularjs would make it available to factory/constructor function which create our services instance.\nIn such a case provider() function do the job. using provider() function we can create configurable services.</p>\n\n<p>We can create configurable services using provider syntax as given below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*step1:define a service */\napp.provider('service',function serviceProviderConstructor(){});\n\n/*step2:configure the service */\napp.config(function configureService(serviceProvider){});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2><strong>How does provider syntax internally work?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>1.Provider object is created using constructor function we defined in our provider function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var serviceProvider = new serviceProviderConstructor();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2.The function we passed in app.config(), get executed. This is called config phase, and here we have a chance to customize our service.</p>\n\n<pre><code>configureService(serviceProvider);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3.Finally service instance is created by calling $get method of serviceProvider.</p>\n\n<pre><code>serviceInstance = serviceProvider.$get()\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Sample code for creating service using provide syntax:</h2>\n\n<pre><code>var app= angular.module('myApp', []);\napp.provider('providerPattern',function providerConstructor(){\n  //this function works as constructor function for provider\n  this.firstName = 'Arnold ';\n  this.lastName = ' Schwarzenegger' ;\n  this.greetMessage = ' Welcome, This is default Greeting Message' ;\n  //adding some method which we can call in app.config() function\n  this.setGreetMsg = function(msg){\n    if(msg){\n      this.greetMessage =  msg ;\n    }\n  };\n\n  //We can also add a method which can change firstName and lastName\n  this.$get = function(){\n    var firstName = this.firstName;\n    var lastName = this.lastName ;\n    var greetMessage = this.greetMessage;\n    var data={\n       greet: function(){\n         console.log('hello, ' + firstName + lastName+'!

Hence, it can be instantiated in different controllers when you are injecting it inside your controller/factory/directive functions. It is instantiated only once per app.</p>\n\n<h2>Service</h2>\n\n<p>Simply while looking at the services think about the array prototype. A service is a function which instantiates a new object using the 'new' keyword. You can add properties and functions to a service object by using the <code>this</code> keyword. Unlike a factory, it doesn't return anything (it returns an object which contains methods/properties).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('MyService', function() {\n    //directly binding events to this context\n    this.myServiceFunction = function() {\n        //TO DO:\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use it when you need to share a single object throughout the application. For example, authenticated user details, share-able methods/data, Utility functions etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Provider</h2>\n\n<p>A provider is used to create a configurable service object. You can configure the service setting from config function. It returns a value by using the <code>$get()</code> function. The <code>$get</code> function gets executed on the run phase in angular.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.provider('configurableService', function() {\n    var name = '';\n    //this method can be be available at configuration time inside app.config.\n    this.setName = function(newName) {\n        name = newName;\n    };\n    this.$get = function() {\n        var getName = function() {\n             return name;\n        };\n        return {\n            getName: getName //exposed object to where it gets injected.\n        };\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you need to provide module-wise configuration for your service object before making it available, eg. suppose you want to set your API URL on basis of your Environment like <code>dev</code>, <code>stage</code> or <code>prod</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>NOTE</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>Only provider will be available in config phase of angular, while\n  service &amp; factory are not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hope this has cleared up your understanding about <strong>Factory, Service and Provider</strong>.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15666048/angularjs-service-vs-provider-vs-factory/28262966#28262966", "question_id": 15666048, "answer_id": 28262966}, {"body": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers\">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers</a> This should probably be the canonical source for the answer to this question.

That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, <code>$.ajax</code> returns immediately and the next statement, <code>return result;</code>, is executed before the function you passed as <code>success</code> callback was even called.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer: </p>\n\n<h2>Synchronous</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer you needed.</p>\n\n<p>The same is happening when you make a function call containing \"normal\" code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function findItem() {\n    var item;\n    while(item_not_found) {\n        // search\n    }\n    return item;\n}\n\nvar item = findItem();\n\n// Do something with item\ndoSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even though <code>findItem</code> might take a long time to execute, any code coming after <code>var item = findItem();</code> has to <em>wait</em> until the function returns the result.</p>\n\n<h2>Asynchronous</h2>\n\n<p>You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should <em>call you back</em> on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.</p>\n\n<p>That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request. </p>\n\n<pre><code>findItem(function(item) {\n    // Do something with item\n});\ndoSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a <em>callback</em> (notice something? <em>call back</em> ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Solution(s)</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript!</strong> While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does \"Ajax\"), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it bad do you ask?</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not. </p>\n\n<p>All of this is really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.</p>\n\n<h2>Restructure code</h2>\n\n<h3>Let functions accept callbacks</h3>\n\n<p>The better approach is to organize your code properly around callbacks. In the example in the question, you can make <code>foo</code> accept a callback and use it as <code>success</code> callback. So this</p>\n\n<pre><code>var result = foo();\n// Code that depends on 'result'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>becomes</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo(function(result) {\n    // Code that depends on 'result'\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we pass a function as argument to <code>foo</code>. You can pass any function reference, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function myCallback(result) {\n    // Code that depends on 'result'\n}\n\nfoo(myCallback);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>foo</code> itself is defined as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo(callback) {\n    $.ajax({\n        // ...\n        success: callback\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>callback</code> will refer to the function we pass to <code>foo</code> when we call it and we simply pass it on to <code>success</code>. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, <code>$.ajax</code> will call <code>callback</code> and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with <code>result</code>, since this is how we defined the callback).</p>\n\n<p>You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo(callback) {\n    $.ajax({\n        // ...\n        success: function(response) {\n            // For example, filter the response\n            callback(filtered_response);\n        }\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's easier to write code using callbacks than it seems. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.<br>\nDifficulties could arise when you have to work with third party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.</p>\n\n<h3>Use promises</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">Promise API</a> is a new feature of ECMAScript 6, but it has good <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises\">browser support</a> already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird\">bluebird</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Promises are containers for <em>future</em> values. When the promise receives the value (it is <em>resolved</em>) or when it is cancelled (<em>rejected</em>), it notifies all of its \"listeners\" who want to access this value.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you do decouple your code and they are easier to compose.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple example of using a promise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function delay() {\n  // `delay` returns a promise\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42\n    }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\ndelay().then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise\n  console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved\n}).catch(function(v) {\n  // Or do something else if it is rejected \n  // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function ajax(url) {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    xhr.onload = function() {\n      resolve(this.responseText);\n    };\n    xhr.onerror = reject;\n    xhr.open('GET', url);\n    xhr.send();\n  });\n}\n\najax(\"/echo/json\").then(function(result) {\n  // Code depending on result\n}).catch(function() {\n  // An error occurred\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Describing all the advantages that promises offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.</p>\n\n<p>More information about promises: <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/\">HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises</a></p>\n\n<h3>jQuery: Use deferred objects</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4866721/what-are-deferred-objects\">Deferred objects</a> are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises, but expose a slightly different API.</p>\n\n<p>Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a \"deferred object\" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function ajax() {\n    return $.ajax(...);\n}\n\najax().done(function(result) {\n    // Code depending on result\n}).fail(function() {\n    // An error occurred\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Promise gotchas</strong></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just <em>containers</em> for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function checkPassword() {\n    return $.ajax({\n        url: '/password',\n        data: {\n            username: $('#username').val(),\n            password: $('#password').val()\n        },\n        type: 'POST',\n        dataType: 'json'\n    });\n}\n\nif (checkPassword()) {\n    // Tell the user they're logged in\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code misunderstands the above asynchrony issues. Specifically, <code>$.ajax()</code> doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the <code>if</code> statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as <code>true</code>, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.</p>\n\n<p>But the fix is easy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>checkPassword()\n.done(function(r) {\n    if (r) {\n        // Tell the user they're logged in\n    } else {\n        // Tell the user their password was bad\n    }\n})\n.fail(function(x) {\n    // Tell the user something bad happened\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now we're still calling the '/password' page on the server, but our code now properly handles the wait time for the server to respond. The <code>$.ajax()</code> call still returns immediately with a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, but we use it to attach event listeners to <code>.done()</code> and <code>.fail()</code>. In the <code>.done()</code> call, where the server responded with a normal response (HTTP 200), we check the object returned by the server. In this example the server is just returning true if the login was successful, false if not, so <code>if (r)</code> is checking for true/false.</p>\n\n<p>In the <code>.fail()</code> handler we're dealing with something going wrong - for example if the user lost their internet connection while they were typing in their username and password, or if your server went down.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Not recommended: Synchronous \"Ajax\" calls</h3>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, some asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:</p>\n\n<h3>Without jQuery</h3>\n\n<p>If you directly use a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/\"><code>XMLHTTPRequest</code></a> object, pass <code>false</code> as third argument to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-open%28%29-method\"><code>.open</code></a>.</p>\n\n<h3>jQuery</h3>\n\n<p>If you use <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/\">jQuery</a>, you can set the <code>async</code> option to <code>false</code>. Note that this option is <em>deprecated</em> since jQuery 1.8.\nYou can then either still use a <code>success</code> callback or access the <code>responseText</code> property of the <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR\">jqXHR object</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo() {\n    var jqXHR = $.ajax({\n        //...\n        async: false\n    });\n    return jqXHR.responseText;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as <code>$.get</code>, <code>$.getJSON</code>, etc., you have to change it to <code>$.ajax</code> (since you can only pass configuration parameters to <code>$.ajax</code>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Heads up!</strong> It is not possible to make a synchronous <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/please-explain-jsonp\">JSONP</a> request.

That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#send%28%29\"><code>.send</code></a> returns immediately and the next statement, <code>return result;</code>, is executed before the function you passed as <code>success</code> callback was even called.</p>\n\n<p>This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple analogy</p>\n\n<pre><code>function getFive(){ \n    var a;\n    setTimeout(function(){\n         a=5;\n    },10);\n    return a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/7RK3k/\">(Fiddle)</a></p>\n\n<p>The value of <code>a</code> returned is <code>undefined</code> since the <code>a=5</code> part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.</p>\n\n<p>One possible solution to this problem is to code <em>re-actively</em> , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this\n    alert(a);\n}\n\nfunction getFive(whenDone){ \n    var a;\n    setTimeout(function(){\n         a=5;\n         whenDone(a);\n    },10);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style\">CPS</a>. Basically, we're passing <code>getFive</code> an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).</p>\n\n<p>Usage would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>getFive(onComplete);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which should alert \"5\" to the screen. <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/PAjZR/\">(Fiddle)</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Possible solutions</h1>\n\n<p>There are basically two ways how to solve this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make the AJAX call synchronous (lets call it SJAX).</li>\n<li>Restructure your code to work properly with callbacks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>1. Synchronous AJAX - Don't do it!!</h2>\n\n<p>As for synchronous AJAX, <strong>don't do it!</strong> Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.</p>\n  \n  <p>In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you <em>have</em> to do it, you can pass a flag: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests#Synchronous_request\">Here is how:</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>var request = new XMLHttpRequest();\nrequest.open('GET', 'yourURL', false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous\nrequest.send(null);\n\nif (request.status === 200) {// That's HTTP for 'ok'\n  console.log(request.responseText);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>2. Restructure code</h2>\n\n<p>Let your function accept a callback. In the example code <code>foo</code> can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to <em>react</em> when <code>foo</code> completes. </p>\n\n<p>So:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var result = foo();\n// code that depends on `result` goes here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Becomes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo(function(result) {\n    // code that depends on `result`\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function myHandler(result) {\n    // code that depends on `result`\n}\nfoo(myHandler);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer. </p>\n\n<p>Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo(callback) {\n    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // when the request is loaded\n       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// we're calling our method\n    };\n    httpRequest.open('GET', \"/echo/json\");\n    httpRequest.send();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/DAcWT/\">(fiddle)</a></p>\n\n<p>We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully, we can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively solving our issue.</p>\n\n<p>If you're still having a hard time understanding this <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started\">read the AJAX getting started guide</a> at MDN.</p>\n", "title": "How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "ajax", "asynchronous"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14220321/how-do-i-return-the-response-from-an-asynchronous-call/16825593#16825593", "question_id": 14220321, "answer_id": 16825593}, {"body": "<p><strong>XHR2</strong> (first of all read the answers from Benjamin Gruenbaum &amp; Felix Kling)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't use jQuery, and want a nice short XHR2 which works on the modern browsers and also on the mobile browsers I suggest to use it this way.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function ajax(a,b,c){ // Url, Callback, just a placeholder\n c=new XMLHttpRequest;\n c.open('GET',a);\n c.onload=b;\n c.send()\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It's shorter than all other functions Listed.</li>\n<li>The callback is set directly (so no extra unnecessary closures).</li>\n<li>It uses the new onload (so you don't have to check for readystate &amp;&amp; status)</li>\n<li>there are some other situations which i don't remember that make the xhr1 annoying. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are 2 ways to get the response of this ajax call(3 using the xhr var name):</p>\n\n<p>The simplest</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.response\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or if for some reason you <code>bind()</code> the callback to a class</p>\n\n<pre><code>e.target.response\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example</p>\n\n<pre><code>function callback(e){\n console.log(this.response);\n}\najax('URL',callback);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem)</p>\n\n<pre><code>ajax('URL',function(e){console.log(this.response)});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nothing easier.</p>\n\n<p>Now some ppl will probably say that it's better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name.

And I can confirm as I'm using this approach since xhr2 exists. I never had any type of problem on all browsers I use.</p>\n\n<p>onreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.</p>\n\n<p>Using the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures else you lost it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now if you want something more complex using post and FormData you can easily extend this function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function x(a,b,e,d,c){ // Url,callback,method,formdata or {key:val},placeholder\n c=new XMLHttpRequest;\n c.open(e||'get',a);\n c.onload=b;\n c.send(d||null)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again ... it's a very short function but it does get &amp; post</p>\n\n<p>examples of usage:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x(url,callback);//by default it's get so no need to set\nx(url,callback,'post',{'key':'val'}); //no need to set post data\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or pass a full form element (<code>document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]</code>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>var fd=new FormData(form);\nx(url,callback,'post',fd);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or set some custom values</p>\n\n<pre><code>var fd=new FormData();\nfd.append('key','val')\nx(url,callback,'post',fd);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I don't implemented sync... it's a bad thing.</p>\n\n<p>Said that ... why don't do it the easy way?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comment the use of error &amp;&amp; synchronous does completely break the point of the answer.Which is a nice short way to use ajax in the proper way.</p>\n\n<p><em>Errror handler</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>function x(a,b,e,d,c){ // URL,callback,method,formdata or {key:val},placeholder\n c=new XMLHttpRequest;\n c.open(e||'get',a);\n c.onload=b;\n c.onerror=error;\n c.send(d||null)\n}\nfunction error(e){\n console.log('--Error--',this.type);\n console.log('this: ',this);\n console.log('Event: ',e)     \n}\nfunction displayAjax(e){\n console.log(e,this);\n}\nx('WRONGURL',displayAjax);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above script you have an error handler which is statically defined so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.</p>\n\n<p>But to really get out an error the <strong>only</strong> way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browsers throws an error.</p>\n\n<p>error handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob arraybuffer or whatever.... </p>\n\n<p>Even if you pass 'POSTAPAPAP' as methot it won't throw an error.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you pass 'fdggdgilfdghfldj' as formdata it won't throw an error.</p>\n\n<p>In the first case the error is inside the <code>displayAjax()</code> under <code>this.statusText</code>\nas <code>Method not Allowed</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In the second case it simply works. You have to check at the server side if you passed the right post data.</p>\n\n<p>crossdomain not allowed throws error automatically.</p>\n\n<p>In the error response there are no error codes.</p>\n\n<p>There is only the <code>this.type</code> which is set to error.</p>\n\n<p>Why add errorhandler if you totally have no control over errors?\nMost of the errors are returned inside this in the callback function <code>displayAjax()</code></p>\n\n<p>So: NO need for error checks if your able to copy and paste the url properly. ;)</p>\n\n<p><em>ps.: As the first test i wrote x('x',displayAjax).. and it totally got a response...??? so I checked the folder where the HTML is located .. and there was a file called 'x.xml'..\nso even if you forget the extension of your file xhr2 WILL FIND IT</em> I lol'd</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Read a file syncronous</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't do that.</strong></p>\n\n<p>if you wan't to block the browser for a while load a nice big txt file syncronous</p>\n\n<pre><code>function omg(a,c){ // Url\n c=new XMLHttpRequest;\n c.open('GET',a,true);\n c.send();\n return c; //or c.response \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>now you can do </p>\n\n<pre><code> var res=omg('thisIsGonnaBlockThePage.txt');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is no other way to do this in a non asynchronous way.(yeah with setTimeout loop... but srsly?)</p>\n\n<p>Another point is .. if you work with API's or just you own list's files or whatever you always use different functions for each request.. </p>\n\n<p>Only if you have a page where you load always the same XML/JSON or whatever you need only one function.In that case modify a little the ajax function and replace b with your special function.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>the functions above are for basic use.</p>\n\n<p>if you want to EXTEND the function ...</p>\n\n<p>yes you can</p>\n\n<p>I'm using a lot of API's and one of the first functions i integrate in every html page is the first ajax function in this answer ..with GET only...</p>\n\n<p>but you can do a lot of stuff with xhr2:</p>\n\n<p>I made a download manager (using ranges on both sides with resume,filereader,filesystem),various image resizers converters using canvas,populate websql databases with base64images and much more... but in thisc cases you should create a function only for that purpose... sometimes you need blob, arraybuffers, you can set headers , override mimetype and there is a lot more...</p>\n\n<p>but the question here is how to return an Ajax response ...

This in turn means that the value you're returning has not been set to the correct value in time. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple analogy for the issue:\n<div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>    function getFive(){\r\n        var data;\r\n        setTimeout(function(){ // set a timer for one second in the future\r\n           data = 5; // after a second, do this\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n        return data;\r\n    }\r\n    document.body.innerHTML = getFive(); // `undefined` here and not 5</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The value of <code>data</code> is <code>undefined</code> since the <code>data = 5</code> part has not executed yet. It will likely execute in a second but by that time it is irrelevant to the returned value.</p>\n\n<p>Since the operation did not happen yet (AJAX, server call, IO, timer) you're returning the value before the request got the chance to tell your code what that value is.</p>\n\n<p>One possible solution to this problem is to code <em>re-actively</em> , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed. Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.</p>\n\n<h1>Quick recap on promises</h1>\n\n<p>A Promise is a <em>value over time</em>. Promises have state, they start as pending with no value and can settle to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fulfilled</strong> meaning that the computation completed successfully.</li>\n<li><strong>rejected</strong> meaning that the computation failed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A promise can only change states <em>once</em> after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach <code>then</code> handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. <code>then</code> handlers allow <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22539815/arent-promises-just-callbacks\">chaining</a> of calls. Promises are created by <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22519784/how-do-i-convert-an-existing-callback-api-to-promises\">using APIs that return them</a>. For example, the more modern AJAX replacement <code>fetch</code> or jQuery's <code>$.get</code> return promises.</p>\n\n<p>When we call <code>.then</code> on a promise and <em>return</em> something from it - we get a promise for <em>the processed value</em>. If we return another promise we'll get amazing things, but let's hold our horses.</p>\n\n<h1>With promises</h1>\n\n<p>Let's see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let's demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Promise\">Promise constructor</a> for creating a delay function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function delay(ms){ // takes amount of milliseconds\n    // returns a new promise\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        setTimeout(function(){ // when the time is up\n            resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\n        }, ms);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, after we converted setTimeout to use promises, we can use <code>then</code> to make it count:</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function delay(ms){ // takes amount of milliseconds\r\n  // returns a new promise\r\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\r\n    setTimeout(function(){ // when the time is up\r\n      resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\r\n    }, ms);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getFive(){\r\n  // we're RETURNING the promise, remember, a promise is a wrapper over our value\r\n  return delay(100).then(function(){ // when the promise is ready\r\n      return 5; // return the value 5, promises are all about return values\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n// we _have_ to wrap it like this in the call site, we can't access the plain value\r\ngetFive().then(function(five){ \r\n   document.body.innerHTML = five;\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Basically, instead of returning a <em>value</em> which we can't do because of the concurrency model - we're returning a <em>wrapper</em> for a value that we can <em>unwrap</em> with <code>then</code>. It's like a box you can open with <code>then</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Applying this</h3>\n\n<p>This stands the same for your original API call, you can:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo() {\n    // RETURN the promise\n    return fetch(\"/echo/json\").then(function(response){\n        return response.json(); // process it inside the `then`\n    });\n}\n\nfoo().then(function(response){\n    // access the value inside the `then`\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So this works just as well. We've learned we can't return values from already asynchronous calls but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.</p>\n\n<h1>ES2015 (ES6)</h1>\n\n<p>ES6 introduces <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*\">generators</a> which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function* foo(){ // notice the star, this is ES6 so new browsers/node/io only\n    yield 1;\n    yield 2;\n    while(true) yield 3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is a function that returns an <em>iterator</em> over the sequence <code>1,2,3,3,3,3,....</code> which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility there is one particular interesting case.</p>\n\n<p>If the sequence we're producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of <em>future</em> values - that is: promises.</p>\n\n<p>This somewhat tricky but very powerful trick lets us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several \"runners\" that do this for you, writing one is a short few lines of code but is beyond the scope of this answer. I'll be using Bluebird's <code>Promise.coroutine</code> here, but there are other wrappers like <code>co</code> or <code>Q.async</code>. </p>\n\n<pre><code>var foo = coroutine(function*(){\n    var data = yield fetch(\"/echo/json\"); // notice the yield\n    // code here only executes _after_ the request is done\n    return data.json(); // data is defined\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var main = coroutine(function*(){\n   var bar = yield foo(); // wait our earlier coroutine, it returns a promise\n   // server call done here, code below executes when done\n   var baz = yield fetch(\"/api/users/\"+bar.userid); // depends on foo's result\n   console.log(baz); // runs after both requests done\n});\nmain();\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>ES2016 (ES7)</h1>\n\n<p>In ES7, this is further standardized, there are several proposals right now but in all of them you can <code>await</code> promise. This is just \"sugar\" (nicer syntax) for the ES6 proposal above by adding the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords. Making the above example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>async function foo(){\n    var data = await fetch(\"/echo/json\"); // notice the await\n    // code here only executes _after_ the request is done\n    return data.json(); // data is defined\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It still returns a promise just the same :)</p>\n", "title": "How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "ajax", "asynchronous"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14220321/how-do-i-return-the-response-from-an-asynchronous-call/30180679#30180679", "question_id": 14220321, "answer_id": 30180679}, {"body": "<p>Another approach to return value from an asynchronous function, is to pass in a object that will store the result from the asynchronous function.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of the same:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var async = require(\"async\");\n\n// This wires up result back to the caller\nvar result = {};\nvar asyncTasks = [];\nasyncTasks.push(function(_callback){\n    // some asynchronous operation\n    $.ajax({\n        url: '...',\n        success: function(response) {\n            result.response = response;\n            _callback();\n        }\n    });\n});\n\nasync.parallel(asyncTasks, function(){\n    // result is available after performing asynchronous operation\n    console.log(result)\n    console.log('Done');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am using <code>result</code> object to store the value during the asynchronous operation.

This allows it to share a lot of the host operating system resources. Also, it uses a layered filesystem (<a href=\"http://aufs.sourceforge.net/\">AuFS</a>) and manages networking. </p>\n\n<p>AuFS is a layered file system, so you can have a read only part and a write part which are merged together. One could have the common parts of the operating system as read only (and shared amongst all of your containers) and then give each container its own mount for writing.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's say you have a 1GB container image; if you wanted to use a Full VM, you would need to have 1GB times x number of VMs you want. With docker and AuFS you can share the bulk of the 1GB between all the containers and if you have 1000 containers you still might only have a little over 1GB of space for the containers OS (assuming they are all running the same OS image).   </p>\n\n<p>A full virtualized system gets its own set of resources allocated to it, and does minimal sharing. You get more isolation, but it is much heavier (requires more resources). With docker you get less isolation, but the containers are lightweight (require fewer resources). So you could easily run thousands of containers on a host, and it won't even blink. Try doing that with Xen, and unless you have a really big host, I don't think it is possible.</p>\n\n<p>A full virtualized system usually takes minutes to start, whereas docker/LXC/runC containers take seconds, and often even less than a second. </p>\n\n<p>There are pros and cons for each type of virtualized system. If you want full isolation with guaranteed resources, a full VM is the way to go. If you just want to isolate processes from each other and want to run a ton of them on a reasonably sized host, then docker/LXC/runC seems to be the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, check out <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150326185901/http://blog.dotcloud.com/under-the-hood-linux-kernels-on-dotcloud-part\">this set of blog posts</a> which do a good job of explaining how LXC works.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I feel foolish for asking, but why is deploying software to a docker image (if that's the right term) easier than simply deploying to a consistent production environment?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Deploying a consistent production environment is easier said than done. Even if you use tools like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_%28software%29\">chef</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_%28software%29\">puppet</a>, there are always OS updates and other things that change between hosts and environments. </p>\n\n<p>Docker gives you the ability to snapshot the OS into a shared image, and makes it easy to deploy on other docker hosts. Locally, dev, qa, prod, etc.: all the same image. Sure you can do this with other tools, but not nearly as easily or fast. </p>\n\n<p>This is great for testing; lets say you have thousands of tests that need to connect to a database, and each test needs a pristine copy of the database and will make changes to the data. The classic approach to this is to reset the database after every test either with custom code or with tools like <a href=\"https://flywaydb.org/\">Flyway</a> - this can be very time consuming and means that tests must be run serially. However, with Docker you could create an image of your database and run up one instance per test, and then run all the tests in parallel since you know they will all be running against the same snapshot of the database. Since the tests are running in parallel and in docker containers they could run all on the same box at the same time and should finish much faster. Try doing that with a full VM.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> From comments...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Interesting! I suppose I'm still confused by the notion of \"snapshot[ting] the OS\". How does one do that without, well, making an image of the OS?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let's see if I can explain. You start with a base image, and then make your changes, and commit those changes using docker, and it creates an image. This image contains only the differences from the base. When you want to run your image, you also need the base, and it layers your image on top of the base using a layered file system: as mentioned above, Docker uses AUFS. AUFS merges the different layers together and you get what you want; you just need to run it. You can keep adding more and more images (layers) and it will continue to only save the diffs. Since docker typically builds on top of ready-made images from a <a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/\">registry</a>, you rarely have to \"snapshot\" the whole OS yourself.</p>\n", "title": "How is Docker different from a normal virtual machine?", "tags": ["docker", "virtual-machine", "virtualization", "docker-container"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine/16048358#16048358", "question_id": 16047306, "answer_id": 16048358}, {"body": "<p>Through this post we are going to draw some lines of differences between VMs and LXCs.

Linux Containers serve as a lightweight alternative to VMs as they don\u2019t require the hypervisors viz. Virtualbox, KVM, Xen etc.</p>\n\n<p>Now unless you were drugged by Alan (Zach Galifianakis- from the Hangover series) and have been in Vegas for the last year,  you will be pretty aware about the tremendous spurt of interest for linux containers technology and if I will be specific one container project which has created a buzz around the world in last few months is \u2013 Docker leading to some echoing opinions that cloud computing environments should abandon virtual machines (VMs) and replace them with containers due to their lower overhead and potentially better performance.</p>\n\n<p>But the big question is, is it feasible?, will it be sensible ?</p>\n\n<p>a.  LXCs are scoped to an instance of Linux. It might be different flavors of Linux ( e.g. a Ubuntu container on a Centos host but it\u2019s still Linux. ) Similarly, Windows-based containers are scoped to an instance of Windows now if we look at VMs they have a pretty broader scope and using the hypervisors you  are not limited to Operating Systems  linux or windows.</p>\n\n<p>b. LXCs have low overheads and have better performance as compared to VMs. Tools viz. Docker which are built on the shoulders of LXC technology have provided developers with a platform to run their applications and at the same time have empowered ops people with a tool that will allow them to deploy the same container on production servers or data centers. It tries to make the experience between a developer running an app, booting and testing an app and an operations person deploying that app seamless because this is where all the friction lies in and purpose of DevOps is to break down those silos.</p>\n\n<p>So the best approach is the cloud infrastructure providers should advocate an appropriate use of the VMs and LXC, as they are each suited to handle specific workloads and scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Abandoning VMs is not practical as of now.

It also provides many other wrappers such as registry and versioning of images.

That will clear up lot of things.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I'm simplifying a bit in describing below. See references for more information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How virtualization works at low level?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this case VM manager takes over the CPU ring 0 (or the \"root mode\" in newer CPUs) and intercepts all privileged calls made by guest OS to create illusion that guest OS has its own hardware. Fun fact: Before 1998 it was thought to be impossible to achieve this in x86 architecture because there was no way to do this kind of interception. The folks at VMWare <a href=\"https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/VMware_paravirtualization.pdf\">were the first</a> who had an idea to rewrite the executable bytes in memory for privileged calls of guest OS to achieve this.</p>\n\n<p>The net effect is that virtualization allows you to run two completely different OS on same hardware. Each guest OS goes through all the process of bootstrapping, loading kernel etc. You can have very tight security, for example, guest OS can't get full access to host OS or other guests and mess things up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How containers works at low level?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Around 1996, people including some of the employees at Google implemented new kernel level feature called <em>namespaces</em> (however the idea long before <a href=\"https://www.linux.com/component/content/article/186-virtualization/300057-containers-vs-hypervisors-choosing-the-best-virtualization-technology-\">existed in FreeBSD</a>). One of the function of OS is to allow sharing of global resources like network and disk to processes. What if these global resources were wrapped in namespaces so that they are visible only to those processes that runs in the same namespace? Say, you can get a chunk of disk and put that in namespace X and then processes running in namespace Y can't see or access it. Similarly, processes in namespace X can't access anything in memory that is allocated to namespace Y. Of course, processes in X can't see or talk to processes in namespace Y. This provides kind of virtualization and isolation for global resources. This is how docker works: Each container runs in its own namespace but uses exactly the <em>same</em> kernel as all other containers. The isolation happens because kernel knows the namespace that was assigned to the process and during API calls it makes sure that process can only access resources in its own namespace.</p>\n\n<p>The limitations of containers vs VM should be obvious now: You can't run completely different OS in containers like in VMs. However you <em>can</em> run different distros of Linux because they do share the same kernel. The isolation level is not as strong as in VM. In fact, there was a way for \"guest\" container to take over host in early implementations. Also you can see that when you load new container, the entire new copy of OS doesn't start like it does in VM. All containers <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25444099/why-docker-has-ability-to-run-different-linux-distribution\">share same kernel</a>. This is why containers are light weight. Also unlike VM, you don't have to pre-allocate significant chunk of memory to VM because we are not running new copy of OS. This enables to run thousands of containers on one OS while sandboxing them which might not be possible to do if we were running separate copy of OS in its own VM.</p>\n", "title": "How is Docker different from a normal virtual machine?", "tags": ["docker", "virtual-machine", "virtualization", "docker-container"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine/34757096#34757096", "question_id": 16047306, "answer_id": 34757096}, {"body": "<p>Docker isn't a virtualization methodology. It relies on other tools that actually implement container-based virtualization or operating system level virtualization. For that, Docker was initially using LXC driver, then moved to libcontainer which is now renamed as runc. Docker primarily focuses on automating the deployment of applications inside application containers. Application containers are designed to package and run a single service, whereas system containers are designed to run multiple processes, like virtual machines. So, Docker is considered as a container management or application deployment tool on containerized systems.</p>\n\n<p>In order to know how it is different from other virtualizations, let's go through virtualization and its types. Then, it would be easier to understand what's the difference there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Virtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>In its conceived form, it was considered a method of logically dividing mainframes to allow multiple applications to run simultaneously. However, the scenario drastically changed when companies and open source communities were able to provide a method of handling the privileged instructions in one way or another and allow for multiple operating systems to be run simultaneously on a single x86 based system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong></p>\n\n<p>The hypervisor handles creating the virtual environment on which the guest virtual machines operate. It supervises the guest systems and makes sure that resources are allocated to the guests as necessary. The hypervisor sits in between the physical machine and virtual machines and provides virtualization services to the virtual machines. To realize it, it intercepts the guest operating system operations on the virtual machines and emulates the operation on the host machine's operating system. </p>\n\n<p>The rapid development of virtualization technologies, primarily in cloud, has driven the use of virtualization further by allowing multiple virtual servers to be created on a single physical server with the help of hypervisors, such as Xen, VMware Player, KVM, etc., and incorporation of hardware support in commodity processors, such as Intel VT and AMD-V.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Types of Virtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>The virtualization method can be categorized based on how it mimics hardware to a guest operating system and emulates guest operating environment. Primarily, there are three types of virtualization:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Emulation </li>\n<li>Paravirtualization </li>\n<li>Container-based virtualization</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Emulation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Emulation, also known as full virtualization runs the virtual machine OS kernel entirely in software. The hypervisor used in this type is known as Type 2 hypervisor. It is installed on the top of host operating system which is responsible for translating guest OS kernel code to software instructions. The translation is done entirely in software and requires no hardware involvement. Emulation makes it possible to run any non-modified operating system that supports the environment being emulated.  The downside of this type of virtualization is additional system resource overhead that leads to decrease in performance compared to other types of virtualizations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FS8uzm.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FS8uzm.png\" alt=\"Emulation\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Examples in this category include VMware Player, VirtualBox, QEMU, Bochs, Parallels, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paravirtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paravirtualization, also known as Type 1 hypervisor, runs directly on the hardware, or \u201cbare-metal\u201d, and provides virtualization services directly to the virtual machines running on it. It helps the operating system, the virtualized hardware, and the real hardware to collaborate to achieve optimal performance. These hypervisors typically have a rather small footprint and do not, themselves, require extensive resources.</p>\n\n<p>Examples in this category include Xen, KVM, etc.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPO6Um.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPO6Um.png\" alt=\"Paravirtualization\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Container-based Virtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>Container-based virtualization, also know as operating system-level virtualization, enables multiple isolated executions within a single operating system kernel. It has the best possible performance and density and features dynamic resource management. The isolated virtual execution environment provided by this type of virtualization is called container and can be viewed as a traced group of processes. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qTuWpm.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qTuWpm.png\" alt=\"Container-based virtualization\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The concept of a container is made possible by the namespaces feature added to Linux kernel version 2.6.24. The container adds its ID to every process and adding new access control checks to every system call. It is accessed by the <em>clone()</em> system call that allows creating separate instances of previously-global namespaces. </p>\n\n<p>Namespaces can be used in many different ways, but the most common approach is to create an isolated container that has no visibility or access to objects outside the container. Processes running inside the container appear to be running on a normal Linux system although they are sharing the underlying kernel with processes located in other namespaces, same for other kinds of objects. For instance, when using namespaces, the root user inside the container is not treated as root outside the container, adding additional security. </p>\n\n<p>The Linux Control Groups (cgroups) subsystem, next major component to enable container-based virtualization, is used to group processes and manage their aggregate resource consumption. It is commonly used to limit memory and CPU consumption of containers.  Since a containerized Linux system has only one kernel and the kernel has full visibility into the containers, there is only one level of resource allocation and scheduling.</p>\n\n<p>Several management tools are available for Linux containers, including LXC, LXD, systemd-nspawn, lmctfy, Warden, Linux-VServer, OpenVZ, Docker, etc. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Containers vs Virtual Machines</strong></p>\n\n<p>Unlike a virtual machine, a container does not need to boot the operating system kernel, so containers can be created in less than a second. This feature makes container-based virtualization unique and desirable than other virtualization approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Since container-based virtualization adds little or no overhead to the host machine, container-based virtualization has near-native performance</p>\n\n<p>For container-based virtualization, no additional software is required, unlike other virtualizations.</p>\n\n<p>All containers on a host machine share the scheduler of the host machine saving need of extra resources.</p>\n\n<p>Container states (Docker or LXC images) are small in size compared to virtual machine images, so container images are easy to distribute.</p>\n\n<p>Resource management in containers is achieved through cgroups. Cgroups does not allow containers to consume more resources than allocated to them. However, as of now, all resources of host machine are visible in virtual machines, but can't be used. This can be realized by running <code>top</code> or <code>htop</code> on containers and host machine at the same time. The output across all environments will look similar.  </p>\n", "title": "How is Docker different from a normal virtual machine?", "tags": ["docker", "virtual-machine", "virtualization", "docker-container"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine/36368012#36368012", "question_id": 16047306, "answer_id": 36368012}, {"body": "<p>Most of the answers here talk about virtual machines. I'm going to give you a one-liner response to this question that has helped me the most over the last couple years of using Docker. It's this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Docker is just a fancy way to run a process, not a virtual machine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, let me explain a bit more about what that means. Virtual machines are their own beast. I feel like explaining what <em>Docker</em> is will help you understand this more than explaining what a virtual machine is. Especially because there are many fine answers here telling you exactly what someone means when they say \"virtual machine\". So...</p>\n\n<p>A Docker container is just a process (and its children) that is compartmentalized using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups\">cgroups</a> inside the host system's kernel from the rest of the processes. You can actually see your Docker container processes by running <code>ps aux</code> on the host. For example, starting <code>apache2</code> \"in a container\" is just starting <code>apache2</code> as a special process on the host. It's just been compartmentalized from other processes on the machine. It is important to note that your containers do not exist outside of your containerized process' lifetime. When your process dies, your container dies. That's because Docker replaces <code>pid 1</code> inside your container with your application (<code>pid 1</code> is normally the init system). This last point about <code>pid 1</code> is very important.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the filesystem used by each of those container processes, Docker uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS\">UnionFS</a>-backed images, which is what you're downloading when you do a <code>docker pull ubuntu</code>. Each \"image\" is just a series of layers and related metadata. The concept of layering is very important here. Each layer is just a change from the layer underneath it. For example, when you delete a file in your Dockerfile while building a Docker container, you're actually just creating a layer on top of the last layer which says \"this file has been deleted\". Incidentally, this is why you can delete a big file from your filesystem, but the image still takes up the same amount of disk space. The file is still there, in the layers underneath the current one. Layers themselves are just tarballs of files. You can test this out with <code>docker save --output /tmp/ubuntu.tar ubuntu</code> and then <code>cd /tmp &amp;&amp; tar xvf ubuntu.tar</code>. Then you can take a look around. All those directories that look like long hashes are actually the individual layers. Each one contains files (<code>layer.tar</code>) and metadata (<code>json</code>) with information about that particular layer. Those layers just describe changes to the filesystem which are saved as a layer \"on top of\" its original state. When reading the \"current\" data, the filesystem reads data as though it were looking only at the top-most layers of changes. That's why the file appears to be deleted, even though it still exists in \"previous\" layers, because the filesystem is only looking at the top-most layers. This allows completely different containers to share their filesystem layers, even though some significant changes may have happened to the filesystem on the top-most layers in each container. This can save you a ton of disk space, when your containers share their base image layers. However, when you mount directories and files from the host system into your container by way of volumes, those volumes \"bypass\" the UnionFS, so changes are not stored in layers.</p>\n\n<p>Networking in Docker is achieved by using an ethernet bridge (called <code>docker0</code> on the host), and virtual interfaces for every container on the host. It creates a virtual subnet in <code>docker0</code> for your containers to communicate \"between\" one another. There are many options for networking here, including creating custom subnets for your containers, and the ability to \"share\" your host's networking stack for your container to access directly.</p>\n\n<p>Docker is moving very fast. Its <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/\">documentation</a> is some of the best documentation I've ever seen. It is generally well-written, concise, and accurate. I recommend you check the documentation available for more information, and trust the documentation over anything else you read online, including Stack Overflow. If you have specific questions, I highly recommend joining <code>#docker</code> on Freenode IRC and asking there (you can even use Freenode's <a href=\"https://webchat.freenode.net/\">webchat</a> for that!).</p>\n", "title": "How is Docker different from a normal virtual machine?", "tags": ["docker", "virtual-machine", "virtualization", "docker-container"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine/36393773#36393773", "question_id": 16047306, "answer_id": 36393773}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16047306/how-is-docker-different-from-a-normal-virtual-machine", "question_id": 16047306}, {"body": "<p>I'm trying to find a way to scan my entire Linux system for all files containing a specific string of text.

But because I wrote Vagrant, I spend most of my time living in the DevOps world which includes software like Docker. I work with a lot of companies using Vagrant and many use Docker, and I see how the two interplay.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Before I talk too much, a direct answer:</strong> in your specific scenario (yourself working alone, working on Linux, using Docker in production), you can stick with Docker alone and simplify things. In many other scenarios (I discuss further), it isn't so easy.</p>\n\n<p>It isn't correct to directly compare Vagrant to Docker. In some scenarios, they do overlap, and in the vast majority, they don't. Actually, the more apt comparison would be Vagrant versus something like Boot2Docker (minimal OS that can run Docker). Vagrant is a level above Docker in terms of abstractions, so it isn't a fair comparison in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>Vagrant launches things to run apps/services for the purpose of development. This can be on VirtualBox, VMware. It can be remote like AWS, OpenStack. Within those, if you use containers, Vagrant doesn't care, and embraces that: it can automatically install, pull down, build, and run Docker containers, for example. With Vagrant 1.6, Vagrant has <a href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-6-docker-dev-environments.html\">docker-based development environments</a>, and supports using Docker with the same workflow as Vagrant across Linux, Mac, and Windows. Vagrant doesn't try to replace Docker here, it embraces Docker practices.</p>\n\n<p>Docker specifically runs Docker containers. If you're comparing directly to Vagrant: it is specifically a more specific (can only run Docker containers), less flexible (requires Linux or Linux host somewhere) solution. Of course if you're talking about production or CI, there is no comparison to Vagrant! Vagrant doesn't live in these environments, and so Docker should be used. </p>\n\n<p>If your organization runs only Docker containers for all their projects and only has developers running on Linux, then okay, Docker could definitely work for you! </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, I don't see a benefit to attempting to use Docker alone, since you lose a lot of what Vagrant has to offer, which have real business/productivity benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Vagrant can launch VirtualBox, VMware, AWS, OpenStack, etc. machines. It doesn't matter what you need, Vagrant can launch it. If you are using Docker, Vagrant can install Docker on any of these so you can use them for that purpose.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant is a single workflow for all your projects. Or to put another way, it is just one thing people have to learn to run a project whether it is in a Docker container or not. If, for example, in the future, a competitor arises to compete directly with Docker, Vagrant will be able to run that too. </p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant works on Windows (back to XP), Mac (back to 10.5), and Linux (back to kernel 2.6). In all three cases, the workflow is the same. If you use Docker, Vagrant can launch a machine (VM or remote) that can run Docker on all three of these systems.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant knows how to configure some advanced or non-trivial things like networking and syncing folders. For example: Vagrant knows how to attach a static IP to a machine or forward ports, and the configuration is the same no matter what system you use (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.) For synced folders, Vagrant provides multiple mechanisms to get your local files over to the remote machine (VirtualBox shared folders, NFS, rsync, Samba [plugin], etc.). If you're using Docker, even Docker with a VM without Vagrant, you would have to manually do this or they would have to reinvent Vagrant in this case.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant 1.6 has first-class support for <a href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-6-docker-dev-environments.html\">docker-based development environments</a>. This will not launch a virtual machine on Linux, and will automatically launch a virtual machine on Mac and Windows. The end result is that working with Docker is uniform across all platforms, while Vagrant still handles the tedious details of things such as networking, synced folders, etc.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To address specific counter arguments that I've heard in favor of using Docker instead of Vagrant:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>\"It is less moving parts\" - Yes, it can be, if you use Docker exclusively for every project. Even then, it is sacrificing flexibility for Docker lock-in. If you ever decide to not use Docker for any project, past, present, or future, then you'll have more moving parts. If you had used Vagrant, you have that one moving part that supports the rest.</p></li>\n<li><p>\"It is faster!\" - Once you have the host that can run Linux containers, Docker is definitely faster at running a container than any virtual machine would be to launch. But launching a virtual machine (or remote machine) is a one-time cost. Over the course of the day, most Vagrant users never actually destroy their VM. It is a strange optimization for development environments. In production, where Docker really shines, I understand the need to quickly spin up/down containers.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope now its clear to see that it is very difficult, and I believe not correct, to compare Docker to Vagrant. For dev environments, Vagrant is more abstract, more general. Docker (and the various ways you can make it behave like Vagrant) is a specific use case of Vagrant, ignoring everything else Vagrant has to offer. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion: in highly specific use cases, Docker is certainly a possible replacement for Vagrant. In most use cases, it is not. Vagrant doesn't hinder your usage of Docker; it actually does what it can to make that experience smoother. If you find this isn't true, I'm happy to take suggestions to improve things, since a goal of Vagrant is to work equally well with any system.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this clears things up!</p>\n", "title": "Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?", "tags": ["vagrant", "docker"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647069/should-i-use-vagrant-or-docker-for-creating-an-isolated-environment/21314566#21314566", "question_id": 16647069, "answer_id": 21314566}, {"body": "<p>I'm the author of Docker.</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is that if you want to manage machines, you should use Vagrant. And if you want to build and run applications environments, you should use Docker.</p>\n\n<p>Vagrant is a tool for managing virtual machines. Docker is a tool for building and deploying applications by packaging them into lightweight containers. A container can hold pretty much any software component along with its dependencies (executables, libraries, configuration files etc.), and execute it in a guaranteed and repeatable runtime environment. This makes it very easy to build your app once and deploy it anywhere - on your laptop for testing, then on different servers for live deployment etc.</p>\n\n<p>It's a common misconception that you can only use Docker on Linux. That's incorrect, you can also install Docker on Mac, and Windows support is underway. When installed on Mac, Docker bundles a tiny linux VM (25MB on disk!) which acts as a wrapper for your container. Once installed this is completely transparent, you can use the docker command-line in exactly the same way. This gives you the best of both worlds: you can test and develop your application using containers, which are very lightweight, easy to test and easy to move around (see for example <a href=\"https://index.docker.io\">https://index.docker.io</a> for sharing reusable containers with the docker community), and you don't need to worry about the nitty-gritty details of managing virtual machines, which are just a means to an end anyway.</p>\n\n<p>In theory it's possible to use Vagrant as an abstraction layer for Docker. I recommend against this for 2 reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, Vagrant is not a good abstraction for Docker. Vagrant was designed to manage virtual machines. Docker was designed to manage an application runtime. This means that Docker, by design, can interact with an application in richer ways, and has more information about the application runtime. The primitives in Docker are processes, log streams, environment variables and network links between components. The primitives in Vagrant are machines, block devices, and ssh keys. Vagrant simply sits lower in the stack, and the only way it can interact with a container is by pretending it's just another kind of machine, that you can \"boot\" and \"log into\". So, sure, you can type \"vagrant up\" with a docker plugin and something pretty will happen. Is it a substitute for the full breadth of what Docker can do? Try native Docker for a couple days and see for yourself :)</p></li>\n<li><p>Second, the lock-in argument. \"If you use Vagrant as an abstraction, you will not be locked into Docker!\". From the point of view of Vagrant, which is designed to manage machines, this makes perfect sense: aren't containers just another kind of machine? Just like EC2 and VMWare, we must be careful not to tie our provisioning tools to any particular vendor! This would create lock-in - better to abstract it all away with Vagrant. Except this misses the point of Docker entirely. Docker doesn't provision machines, it wraps your application in a lightweight portable runtime which can be dropped anywhere. What runtime you choose for your application has nothing to do with how you provision your machines! For example it's pretty frequent to deploy applications to machines which are provisioned by someone else (for example an EC2 instance deployed by your sysadmin, perhaps using Vagrant), or to bare metal machines which Vagrant can't provision at all. Conversely, you may use Vagrant to provision machines which have nothing to do with developing your application - for example a ready-to-use Windows IIS box or something. Or you may use Vagrant to provision machines for projects which don't use Docker - perhaps they use a combination of rubygems and rvm for dependency management and sandboxing for example.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary: Vagrant is for managing machines, Docker is for building and running application environments.</p>\n", "title": "Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?", "tags": ["vagrant", "docker"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647069/should-i-use-vagrant-or-docker-for-creating-an-isolated-environment/22370529#22370529", "question_id": 16647069, "answer_id": 22370529}, {"body": "<p>Using both is an important part of application delivery testing.

If your purpose is isolaion, Docker is an excellent choice.\n  Vagrant is a VM manager that enables you to script coniguraions of\n  individual VMs as well as do the provisioning. However, it is sill a\n  VM dependent on VirtualBox (or another VM manager) with relaively\n  large overhead. It requires you to have a hard drive ile that can be\n  huge, it takes a lot of RAM, and performance can be subopimal. Docker\n  uses kernel cgroups and namespace isolaion via lxc. This means that\n  you are using the same kernel as the host and the same ile system.\n  Vagrant is a level above Docker in terms of abstracion, so they are\n  not really comparable. Coniguraion management tools such as Puppet are\n  widely used for provisioning target environments. Reusing exising\n  Puppet-based soluions is easy with Docker. You can also slice your\n  soluion, so the infrastructure is provisioned with Puppet; the\n  middleware, the business applicaion itself, or both are provisioned\n  with Docker; and Docker is wrapped by Vagrant. With this range of\n  tools, you can do what\u2019s best for your scenario.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How to build, use and orchestrate Docker containers in DevOps \n<a href=\"http://www.javamagazine.mozaicreader.com/JulyAug2015#&amp;pageSet=34&amp;page=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.javamagazine.mozaicreader.com/JulyAug2015#&amp;pageSet=34&amp;page=0</a></p>\n", "title": "Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?", "tags": ["vagrant", "docker"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647069/should-i-use-vagrant-or-docker-for-creating-an-isolated-environment/32119038#32119038", "question_id": 16647069, "answer_id": 32119038}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16647069/should-i-use-vagrant-or-docker-for-creating-an-isolated-environment", "question_id": 16647069}, {"body": "<p>I made a comment yesterday on an answer where someone had used <code>[0123456789]</code> in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\">regular expression</a> rather than <code>[0-9]</code> or <code>\\d</code>.

However, in some cases the <em>factory</em> gives you a little bit more flexibility to create an injectable with a simpler syntax. That's because while myInjectedService must always be an object, myInjectedFactory can be an object, a function reference, or any value at all. For example, if you wrote a service to create a constructor (as in the last example above), it would have to be instantiated like so: </p>\n\n<pre><code>var myShinyNewObject = new myInjectedService.myFunction()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is arguably less desirable than this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myShinyNewObject = new myInjectedFactory();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(But you should be wary about using this type of pattern in the first place because <em>new</em>-ing objects in your controllers creates hard-to-track dependencies that are difficult to mock for testing. Better to have a service manage a collection of objects for you than use <code>new()</code> wily-nilly.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>One more thing, they are all Singletons...</h3>\n\n<p>Also keep in mind that in both cases, angular is helping you manage a singleton. Regardless of where or how many times you inject your service or function, you will get the same reference to the same object or function. (With the exception of when a factory simply returns a value like a number or string. In that case, you will always get the same value, but not a reference.)</p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory/21900284#21900284", "question_id": 14324451, "answer_id": 21900284}, {"body": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <br><br>\n<strong>1)</strong> When you\u2019re using a <strong>Factory</strong> you create an object, add properties to it, then return that same object.

A more extensive example is below. </p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory('myFactory', function(){\n  var service = {};\n  return service;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now whatever properties we attach to \u2018service\u2019 will be available to us when we pass \u2018myFactory\u2019 into our controller. </p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s add some \u2018private\u2019 variables to our callback function. These won\u2019t be directly accessible from the controller, but we will eventually set up some getter/setter methods on \u2018service\u2019 to be able to alter these \u2018private\u2019 variables when needed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory('myFactory', function($http, $q){\n  var service = {};\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n   _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK';\n    return _finalUrl\n  }\n\n  return service;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re not attaching those variables/function to \u2018service\u2019. We\u2019re simply creating them in order to either use or modify them later. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>baseUrl is the base URL that the iTunes API requires</li>\n<li>_artist is the artist we wish to lookup</li>\n<li>_finalUrl is the final and fully built URL to which we\u2019ll make the call to iTunes makeUrl is a function that will create and return our\niTunes friendly URL.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that our helper/private variables and function are in place, let\u2019s add some properties to the \u2018service\u2019 object. Whatever we put on \u2018service\u2019 we\u2019ll be able to directly use in whichever controller we pass \u2018myFactory\u2019 into. </p>\n\n<p>We are going to create setArtist and getArtist methods that simply return or set the artist. We are also going to create a method that will call the iTunes API with our created URL. This method is going to return a promise that will fulfill once the data has come back from the iTunes API. If you haven\u2019t had much experience using promises in Angular, I highly recommend doing a deep dive on them. </p>\n\n<p>Below <strong>setArtist</strong> accepts an artist and allows you to set the artist. <strong>getArtist</strong> returns the artist callItunes first calls makeUrl() in order to build the URL we\u2019ll use with our $http request. Then it sets up a promise object, makes an $http request with our final url, then because $http returns a promise, we are able to call .success or .error after our request. We then resolve our promise with the iTunes data, or we reject it with a message saying \u2018There was an error\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory('myFactory', function($http, $q){\n  var service = {};\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  service.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  service.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  service.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n  return service;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now our factory is complete. We are now able to inject \u2018myFactory\u2019 into any controller and we\u2019ll then be able to call our methods that we attached to our service object (setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes). </p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myFactoryCtrl', function($scope, myFactory){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the controller above we\u2019re injecting in the \u2018myFactory\u2019 service. We then set properties on our $scope object that are coming from data from \u2018myFactory\u2019. The only tricky code above is if you\u2019ve never dealt with promises before. Because callItunes is returning a promise, we are able to use the .then() method and only set $scope.data.artistData once our promise is fulfilled with the iTunes data. You\u2019ll notice our controller is very \u2018thin\u2019. All of our logic and persistent data is located in our service, not in our controller. \n<br><br>\n<strong>2) Service</strong> <br>\nPerhaps the biggest thing to know when dealing with creating a Service is that  that it\u2019s instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. For you JavaScript gurus this should give you a big hint into the nature of the code. For those of  you with a limited background in JavaScript or for those who aren\u2019t too familiar with what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword actually does, let\u2019s review some JavaScript fundamentals that will eventually help us in understanding the nature of a Service. </p>\n\n<p>To really see the changes that occur when you invoke a function with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, let\u2019s create a function and invoke it with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, then let\u2019s show what the interpreter does when it sees the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. The end results will both be the same.</p>\n\n<p>First let\u2019s create our Constructor. </p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a typical JavaScript constructor function. Now whenever we invoke the Person function using the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, \u2018this\u2019 will be bound to the newly created object. </p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s add a method onto our Person\u2019s prototype so it will be available on every instance of our Person \u2018class\u2019. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Person.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert('My name is ' + this.name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, because we put the sayName function on the prototype, every instance of Person will be able to call the sayName function in order alert that instance\u2019s name.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we have our Person constructor function and our sayName function on its prototype, let\u2019s actually create an instance of Person then call the sayName function. </p>\n\n<pre><code>var tyler = new Person('Tyler', 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts 'My name is Tyler'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So all together the code for creating a Person constructor, adding a function to it\u2019s prototype, creating a Person instance, and then calling the function on its prototype looks like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\nPerson.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert('My name is ' + this.name);\n}\nvar tyler = new Person('Tyler', 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts 'My name is Tyler'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s look at what actually is happening when you use the \u2018new\u2019 keyword in JavaScript. First thing you should notice is that after using \u2018new\u2019 in our example, we\u2019re able to call a method (sayName) on \u2018tyler\u2019 just as if it were an object - that\u2019s because it is. So first, we know that our Person constructor is returning an object, whether we can see that in the code or not. Second, we know that because our sayName function is located on the prototype and not directly on the Person instance, the object that the Person function is returning must be delegating to its prototype on failed lookups. In more simple terms, when we call tyler.sayName() the interpreter says \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to look on the \u2018tyler\u2019 object we just created, locate the sayName function, then call it. Wait a minute, I don\u2019t see it here - all I see is name and age, let me check the prototype. Yup, looks like it\u2019s on the prototype, let me call it.\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>Below is code for how you can think about what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword is actually doing in JavaScript. It\u2019s basically a code example of the above paragraph. I\u2019ve put the \u2018interpreter view\u2019 or the way the interpreter sees the code inside of notes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  //The line below this creates an obj object that will delegate to the person's prototype on failed lookups.\n  //var obj = Object.create(Person.prototype);\n\n  //The line directly below this sets 'this' to the newly created object\n  //this = obj;\n\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n\n  //return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now having this knowledge of what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword really does in JavaScript, creating a Service in Angular should be easier to understand. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing to understand when creating a Service is knowing that Services are instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. Combining that knowledge with our examples above, you should now recognize that you\u2019ll be attaching your properties and methods directly to \u2018this\u2019 which will then be returned from the Service itself. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike what we originally did with the Factory example, we don\u2019t need to create an object then return that object because, like mentioned many times before, we used the \u2018new\u2019 keyword so the interpreter will create that object, have it delegate to it\u2019s prototype, then return it for us without us having to do the work. </p>\n\n<p>First things first, let\u2019s create our \u2018private\u2019 and helper function. This should look very familiar since we did the exact same thing with our factory. I won\u2019t explain what each line does here because I did that in the factory example, if you\u2019re confused, re-read the factory example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we\u2019ll attach all of our methods that will be available in our controller to \u2018this\u2019. </p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  this.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  this.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  this.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now just like in our factory, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be available in whichever controller we pass myService into. Here\u2019s the myService controller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory controller).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myServiceCtrl', function($scope, myService){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myService.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myService.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like I mentioned before, once you really understand what \u2018new\u2019 does, Services are almost identical to factories in Angular. </p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory/23659951#23659951", "question_id": 14324451, "answer_id": 23659951}, {"body": "<h3>app.factory('fn', fn) vs. app.service('fn',fn)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n\n<p>With factories, Angular will invoke the function to get the result.

Either one - they are so similar that the differences are trivial.  If you do choose one over the other, just be aware how they are constructed, so that you can implement them properly.</p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory/24442224#24442224", "question_id": 14324451, "answer_id": 24442224}, {"body": "<h1>The clue is in the name</h1>\n\n<p>Services and factories are similar to one another. Both will yield a singleton object that can be injected into other objects, and so are often used interchangeably.</p>\n\n<p>They are intended to be used semantically to implement different design patterns.</p>\n\n<h2>Services are for implementing a service pattern</h2>\n\n<p>A service pattern is one in which your application is broken into logically consistent units of functionality. An example might be an API accessor, or a set of business logic.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially important in Angular because Angular models are typically just JSON objects pulled from a server, and so we need somewhere to put our business logic.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a Github service for example. It knows how to talk to Github. It knows about urls and methods. We can inject it into a controller, and it will generate and return a promise.</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function() {\n  var base = \"https://api.github.com\";\n\n  angular.module('github', [])\n    .service('githubService', function( $http ) {\n      this.getEvents: function() {\n        var url = [\n          base,\n          '/events',\n          '?callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n        ].join('');\n        return $http.jsonp(url);\n      }\n    });\n  )();\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Factories implement a factory pattern</h2>\n\n<p>Factories, on the other hand are intended to implement a factory pattern. A factory pattern in one in which we use a factory function to generate an object. Typically we might use this for building models. Here is a factory which returns an Author constructor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('user', [])\n  .factory('User', function($resource) {\n    var url = 'http://simple-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/authors/:id'\n    return $resource(url);\n  })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We would make use of this like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('app', ['user'])\n  .controller('authorController', function($scope, User) {\n    $scope.user = new User();\n  })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that factories also return singletons.</p>\n\n<h2>Factories can return a constructor</h2>\n\n<p>Because a factory simply returns an object, it can return any type of object you like, including a constructor function, as we see above.</p>\n\n<h2>Factories return an object; services are newable</h2>\n\n<p>Another technical difference is in the way services and factories are composed. A service function will be newed to generate the object. A factory function will be called and will return the object.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Services are newable constructors.</li>\n<li>Factories are simply called and return an object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This means that in a service, we append to \"this\" which, in the context of a constructor, will point to the object under construction.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate this, here is the same simple object created using a service and a factory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('app', [])\n  .service('helloService', function() {\n    this.sayHello = function() {\n      return \"Hello!\";\n    }\n  })\n  .factory('helloFactory', function() {\n    return {\n      sayHello: function() {\n        return \"Hello!\";\n      }\n    }\n  });\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory/27545899#27545899", "question_id": 14324451, "answer_id": 27545899}, {"body": "<p>I have spent some time trying to figure out the difference.</p>\n\n<p>And i think the factory function uses the module pattern and service function uses the standard java script constructor pattern. </p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory/28967162#28967162", "question_id": 14324451, "answer_id": 28967162}, {"body": "<p>The factory pattern is more flexible as it can return functions and values as well as objects.</p>\n\n<p>There isn't a lot of point in the service pattern IMHO, as everything it does you can just as easily do with a factory. The exceptions might be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you care about the declared type of your instantiated service for some reason - if you use the service pattern, your constructor will be the type of the new service.</li>\n<li>If you already have a constructor function that you're using elsewhere that you also want to use as a service (although probably not much use if you want to inject anything into it!).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Arguably, the service pattern is a <em>slightly</em> nicer way to create a new object from a syntax point of view, but it's also more costly to instantiate. Others have indicated that angular uses \"new\" to create the service, but this isn't quite true - it isn't able to do that because every service constructor has a different number of parameters. What angular actually does is use the factory pattern internally to wrap your constructor function. Then it does some clever jiggery pokery to <em>simulate</em> javascript's \"new\" operator, invoking your constructor with a variable number of injectable arguments - but you can leave out this step if you just use the factory pattern directly, thus very slightly increasing the efficiency of your code.</p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14324451/angular-service-vs-angular-factory/31859058#31859058", "question_id": 14324451, "answer_id": 31859058}, {"body": "<p>All the answers here seem to be around service and factory, and that's valid since that was what was being asked about.

Every 64th character, it outputs a newline. Otherwise, it uses a pair of data tables to figure out what to output, and puts either character 32 (a space) or character 33 (a <code>!</code>). The first table (<code>\"&gt;'txiZ^(~z?\"</code>) is a set of 10 bitmaps describing the appearance of each character, and the second table (<code>\";;;====~$::199\"</code>) selects the appropriate bit to display from the bitmap.</p>\n\n<h3>The second table</h3>\n\n<p>Let's start by examining the second table, <code>int shift = \";;;====~$::199\"[(i*2&amp;8) | (i/64)];</code>. <code>i/64</code> is the line number (6 to 0) and <code>i*2&amp;8</code> is 8 iff <code>i</code> is 4, 5, 6 or 7 mod 8.</p>\n\n<p><code>if((i &amp; 2) == 0) shift /= 8; shift = shift % 8</code> selects either the high octal digit (for <code>i%8</code> = 0,1,4,5) or the low octal digit (for <code>i%8</code> = 2,3,6,7) of the table value. The shift table ends up looking like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>row col val\n6   6-7 0\n6   4-5 0\n6   2-3 5\n6   0-1 7\n5   6-7 1\n5   4-5 7\n5   2-3 5\n5   0-1 7\n4   6-7 1\n4   4-5 7\n4   2-3 5\n4   0-1 7\n3   6-7 1\n3   4-5 6\n3   2-3 5\n3   0-1 7\n2   6-7 2\n2   4-5 7\n2   2-3 3\n2   0-1 7\n1   6-7 2\n1   4-5 7\n1   2-3 3\n1   0-1 7\n0   6-7 4\n0   4-5 4\n0   2-3 3\n0   0-1 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or in tabular form</p>\n\n<pre><code>00005577\n11775577\n11775577\n11665577\n22773377\n22773377\n44443377\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the author used the null terminator for the first two table entries (sneaky!).</p>\n\n<p>This is designed after a seven-segment display, with <code>7</code>s as blanks. So, the entries in the first table must define the segments that get lit up.</p>\n\n<h3>The first table</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html\"><code>__TIME__</code></a> is a special macro defined by the preprocessor. It expands to a string constant containing the time at which the preprocessor was run, in the form <code>\"HH:MM:SS\"</code>. Observe that it contains exactly 8 characters. Note that 0-9 have ASCII values 48 through 57 and <code>:</code> has ASCII value 58. The output is 64 characters per line, so that leaves 8 characters per character of <code>__TIME__</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>7 - i/8%8</code> is thus the index of <code>__TIME__</code> that is presently being output (the <code>7-</code> is needed because we are iterating <code>i</code> downwards). So, <code>t</code> is the character of <code>__TIME__</code> being output.</p>\n\n<p><code>a</code> ends up equalling the following in binary, depending on the input <code>t</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0 00111111\n1 00101000\n2 01110101\n3 01111001\n4 01101010\n5 01011011\n6 01011111\n7 00101001\n8 01111111\n9 01111011\n: 01000000\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each number is a <em>bitmap</em> describing the segments that are lit up in our seven-segment display. Since the characters are all 7-bit ASCII, the high bit is always cleared. Thus, <code>7</code> in the segment table always prints as a blank. The second table looks like this with the <code>7</code>s as blanks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>000055  \n11  55  \n11  55  \n116655  \n22  33  \n22  33  \n444433  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, for example, <code>4</code> is <code>01101010</code> (bits 1, 3, 5, and 6 set), which prints as</p>\n\n<pre><code>----!!--\n!!--!!--\n!!--!!--\n!!!!!!--\n----!!--\n----!!--\n----!!--\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To show we really understand the code, let's adjust the output a bit with this table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  00  \n11  55\n11  55\n  66  \n22  33\n22  33\n  44\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is encoded as <code>\"?;;?==? '::799\\x07\"</code>. For artistic purposes, we'll add 64 to a few of the characters (since only the low 6 bits are used, this won't affect the output); this gives <code>\"?{{?}}?gg::799G\"</code> (note that the 8th character is unused, so we can actually make it whatever we want). Putting our new table in the original code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>main(_){_^448&amp;&amp;main(-~_);putchar(--_%64?32|-~7[__TIME__-_/8%8][\"&gt;'txiZ^(~z?\"-48]&gt;&gt;\"?{{?}}?gg::799G\"[_*2&amp;8|_/64]/(_&amp;2?1:8)%8&amp;1:10);}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>we get</p>\n\n<pre><code>          !!              !!                              !!   \n    !!  !!              !!  !!  !!  !!              !!  !!  !! \n    !!  !!              !!  !!  !!  !!              !!  !!  !! \n          !!      !!              !!      !!                   \n    !!  !!  !!          !!  !!      !!              !!  !!  !! \n    !!  !!  !!          !!  !!      !!              !!  !!  !! \n          !!              !!                              !!   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>just as we expected. It's not as solid-looking as the original, which explains why the author chose to use the table he did.</p>\n", "title": "Obfuscated C Code Contest 2006.

This is then indexed into <code>[\"&gt;'txiZ^(~z?\"-48]</code> (0-9 characters are 48-57 decimal).  The characters in this string must have been chosen for their ASCII values.  This same character ASCII code manipulation continues through the expression, to result in the printing of either a ' ' or '!' depending on the location within the character's glyph.</p>\n", "title": "Obfuscated C Code Contest 2006.

You may want to have it in your home directory or, like me, under <code>/usr/local</code> for consistency because I'm also a Mac user (I prefer not to need to look into different places depending on the machine I happen to be in front of). Another good reason to do that is the fact that the <code>/usr/local</code> folder is probably already in your PATH (unless you like to mess around with your PATH) but chances are your newly-created folder isn't and you'd need to add it to the PATH yourself on your <em>.bash-profile</em> or <em>.bashrc</em> file.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, I changed the default location of the global modules with <code>npm config set prefix '/usr/local'</code>, created the folder <code>/usr/local/lib/node_modules</code> (it will be used by npm) and changed permissions for the folders used by npm with the command: </p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can globally install any module safely.

This cycle can be considered as a loop, during which AngularJS checks if there are any changes to all the variables <strong>watched</strong> by all the <code>$scopes</code>. So if you have <code>$scope.myVar</code> defined in your controller and this variable was <strong>marked for being watched</strong>, then you are implicitly telling AngularJS to monitor the changes on <code>myVar</code> in each iteration of the loop.</p>\n\n<p>A natural follow-up question would be: Is everything attached to <code>$scope</code> being watched? Fortunately, no. If you would watch for changes to every object in your <code>$scope</code>, then quickly a digest loop would take ages to evaluate and you would quickly run into performance issues. That is why the AngularJS team gave us two ways of declaring some <code>$scope</code> variable as being watched (read below).</p>\n\n<h2>$watch helps to listen for $scope changes</h2>\n\n<p>There are two ways of declaring a <code>$scope</code> variable as being watched.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>By using it in your template via the expression <code>&lt;span&gt;{{myVar}}&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>\n<li>By adding it manually via the <code>$watch</code> service</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ad 1)\nThis is the most common scenario and I'm sure you've seen it before, but you didn't know that this has created a watch in the background. Yes, it had! Using AngularJS directives (such as <code>ng-repeat</code>) can also create implicit watches.</p>\n\n<p>Ad 2)\nThis is how you create your own <strong>watches</strong>. <code>$watch</code> service helps you to run some code when some value attached to the <code>$scope</code> has changed. It is rarely used, but sometimes is helpful. For instance, if you want to run some code each time 'myVar' changes, you could do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function MyController($scope) {\n\n    $scope.myVar = 1;\n\n    $scope.$watch('myVar', function() {\n        alert('hey, myVar has changed!');\n    });\n\n    $scope.buttonClicked = function() {\n        $scope.myVar = 2; // This will trigger $watch expression to kick in\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>$apply enables to integrate changes with the digest cycle</h2>\n\n<p>You can think of the <strong><code>$apply</code> function as of an integration mechanism</strong>. You see, each time you change some <strong>watched variable attached to the <code>$scope</code></strong> object directly, AngularJS will know that the change has happened. This is because AngularJS already knew to monitor those changes. So if it happens in code managed by the framework, the digest cycle will carry on.</p>\n\n<p>However, sometimes you want to <strong>change some value outside of the AngularJS world</strong> and see the changes propagate normally.\nConsider this - you have a <code>$scope.myVar</code> value which will be modified within a jQuery's <code>$.ajax()</code> handler. This will happen at some point in future. AngularJS can't wait for this to happen, since it hasn't been instructed to wait on jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>To tackle this, <code>$apply</code> has been introduced. It lets you to start the digestion cycle explicitly. However, you should only use this to migrate some data to AngularJS (integration with other frameworks), but never use this method combined with regular AngularJS code, as AngularJS will throw an error then.</p>\n\n<h2>How is all of this related to the DOM?</h2>\n\n<p>Well, you should really follow the tutorial again, now that you know all this. The digest cycle will make sure that the UI and the JavaScript code stays synchronised, by evaluating every watcher attached to the all <code>$scope</code>s as long as nothing changes. If no more changes happen in the digest loop, then it's considered to be finished.</p>\n\n<p>You can attach objects to the <code>$scope</code> object either explicitly in the Controller, or by declaring them in <code>{{expression}}</code> form directly in the view.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that helps to clarify some basic knowledge about all this.</p>\n\n<p>Further readings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://teropa.info/blog/2013/11/03/make-your-own-angular-part-1-scopes-and-digest.html\">Make Your Own AngularJS, Part 1: Scopes And Digest</a></em> (awesome article!)</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Using $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply in AngularJS", "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-scope"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15112584/using-scope-watch-and-scope-apply-in-angularjs/15113029#15113029", "question_id": 15112584, "answer_id": 15113029}, {"body": "<p>In AngularJS, we update our models, and our views/templates update the DOM \"automatically\" (via built-in or custom directives).</p>\n\n<p>$apply and $watch, both being Scope methods, are not related to the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts\">Concepts</a> page (section \"Runtime\") has a pretty good explanation of the $digest loop, $apply, the $evalAsync queue and the $watch list.

Understanding <code>$watch()</code>, <code>$digest()</code> and <code>$apply()</code> is essential in order to understand AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>When you create a data binding from somewhere in your view to a variable on the $scope object, AngularJS creates a \"watch\" internally. A watch means that AngularJS watches changes in the variable on the <code>$scope object</code>. The framework is \"watching\" the variable. Watches are created using the <code>$scope.$watch()</code> function which I will cover later in this text.</p>\n\n<p>At key points in your application AngularJS calls the <code>$scope.$digest()</code> function. This function iterates through all watches and checks if any of the watched variables have changed. If a watched variable has changed, a corresponding listener function is called. The listener function does whatever work it needs to do, for instance changing an HTML text to reflect the new value of the watched variable. Thus, the <code>$digest()</code> function is what triggers the data binding to update.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time AngularJS will call the $scope.$watch() and <code>$scope.$digest()</code> functions for you, but in some situations you may have to call them yourself. Therefore it is really good to know how they work.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.$apply()</code> function is used to execute some code, and then call <code>$scope.$digest()</code> after that, so all watches are checked and the corresponding watch listener functions are called. The <code>$apply()</code> function is useful when integrating AngularJS with other code.</p>\n\n<p>I will get into more detail about the <code>$watch(), $digest()</code> and <code>$apply()</code> functions in the remainder of this text. </p>\n\n<h2>$watch()</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.watch()</code> function creates a watch of some variable. When you register a watch you pass two functions as parameters to the <code>$watch()</code> function:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A value function</li>\n<li>A listener function</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is an example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$watch(function() {},\n              function() {}\n             );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first function is the value function and the second function is the listener function.</p>\n\n<p>The value function should return the value which is being watched. AngularJS can then check the value returned against the value the watch function returned the last time. That way AngularJS can determine if the value has changed. Here is an example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$watch(function(scope) { return scope.data.myVar },\n              function() {}\n             );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This example valule function returns the <code>$scope</code> variable <code>scope.data.myVar</code>. If the value of this variable changes, a different value will be returned, and AngularJS will call the listener function.</p>\n\n<p>Notice how the value function takes the scope as parameter (without the $ in the name). Via this parameter the value function can access the <code>$scope</code> and its variables. The value function can also watch global variables instead if you need that, but most often you will watch a <code>$scope</code> variable.</p>\n\n<p>The listener function should do whatever it needs to do if the value has changed. Perhaps you need to change the content of another variable, or set the content of an HTML element or something. Here is an example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$watch(function(scope) { return scope.data.myVar },\n              function(newValue, oldValue) {\n                  document.getElementById(\"\").innerHTML =\n                      \"\" + newValue + \"\";\n              }\n             );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This example sets the inner HTML of an HTML element to the new value of the variable, embedded in the b element which makes the value bold. Of course you could have done this using the code <code>{{ data.myVar }</code>, but this is just an example of what you can do inside the listener function.</p>\n\n<h2>$digest()</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.$digest()</code> function iterates through all the watches in the <code>$scope object</code>, and its child $scope objects (if it has any). When <code>$digest()</code> iterates over the watches, it calls the value function for each watch. If the value returned by the value function is different than the value it returned the last time it was called, the listener function for that watch is called.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>$digest()</code> function is called whenever AngularJS thinks it is necessary. For instance, after a button click handler has been executed, or after an <code>AJAX</code> call returns (after the done() / fail() callback function has been executed).</p>\n\n<p>You may encounter some corner cases where AngularJS does not call the <code>$digest()</code> function for you. You will usually detect that by noticing that the data bindings do not update the displayed values. In that case, call <code>$scope.$digest()</code> and it should work. Or, you can perhaps use <code>$scope.$apply()</code> instead which I will explain in the next section. </p>\n\n<h2>$apply()</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.$apply()</code> function takes a function as parameter which is executed, and after that <code>$scope.$digest()</code> is called internally. That makes it easier for you to make sure that all watches are checked, and thus all data bindings refreshed. Here is an <code>$apply()</code> example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$apply(function() {\n    $scope.data.myVar = \"Another value\";\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The function passed to the <code>$apply()</code> function as parameter will change the value of <code>$scope.data.myVar</code>. When the function exits AngularJS will call the <code>$scope.$digest()</code> function so all watches are checked for changes in the watched values. </p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>To illustrate how <code>$watch()</code>, <code>$digest(</code>) and <code>$apply()</code> works, look at this example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=\"myController\"&gt;\n    {{data.time}}\n\n    &lt;br/&gt;\n    &lt;button ng-click=\"updateTime()\"&gt;update time - ng-click&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;button id=\"updateTimeButton\"  &gt;update time&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n    var module       = angular.module(\"myapp\", []);\n    var myController1 = module.controller(\"myController\", function($scope) {\n\n        $scope.data = { time : new Date() };\n\n        $scope.updateTime = function() {\n            $scope.data.time = new Date();\n        }\n\n        document.getElementById(\"updateTimeButton\")\n                .addEventListener('click', function() {\n            console.log(\"update time clicked\");\n            $scope.data.time = new Date();\n        });\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>his example binds the <code>$scope.data.time</code> variable to an interpolation directive which merges the variable value into the HTML page. This binding creates a watch internally on the <code>$scope.data.time variable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The example also contains two buttons. The first button has an <code>ng-click</code> listener attached to it. When that button is clicked the <code>$scope.updateTime()</code> function is called, and after that AngularJS calls <code>$scope.$digest()</code> so that data bindings are updated.</p>\n\n<p>The second button gets a standard JavaScript event listener attached to it from inside the controller function. When the second button is clicked that listener function is executed. As you can see, the listener functions for both buttons do almost the same, but when the second button's listener function is called, the data binding is not updated. That is because the <code>$scope.$digest()</code> is not called after the second button's event listener is executed. Thus, if you click the second button the time is updated in the <code>$scope.data.time</code> variable, but the new time is never displayed.</p>\n\n<p>To fix that we can add a <code>$scope.$digest()</code> call to the last line of the button event listener, like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>document.getElementById(\"updateTimeButton\")\n        .addEventListener('click', function() {\n    console.log(\"update time clicked\");\n    $scope.data.time = new Date();\n    $scope.$digest();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of calling <code>$digest()</code> inside the button listener function you could also have used the <code>$apply()</code> function like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>document.getElementById(\"updateTimeButton\")\n        .addEventListener('click', function() {\n    $scope.$apply(function() {\n        console.log(\"update time clicked\");\n        $scope.data.time = new Date();\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how the <code>$scope.$apply()</code> function is called from inside the button event listener, and how the update of the <code>$scope.data.time</code> variable is performed inside the function passed as parameter to the <code>$apply()</code> function. When the <code>$apply()</code> function call finishes AngularJS calls <code>$digest()</code> internally, so all data bindings are updated. </p>\n", "title": "Using $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply in AngularJS", "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-scope"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15112584/using-scope-watch-and-scope-apply-in-angularjs/35550931#35550931", "question_id": 15112584, "answer_id": 35550931}, {"body": "<p>Angular extends this <code>events-loop</code> creating something called <code>angular context</code>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>$watch()</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every time you bind something in the UI you insert a <code>$watch in a $watch list</code>. </p>\n\n<pre><code>User: &lt;input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"user\" /&gt;\nPassword: &lt;input type=\"password\" ng-model=\"pass\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we have <code>$scope.user</code>, which is bound to the first input, and we have <code>$scope.pass</code>, which is bound to the second one.

With web-forms they are most likely sent with a media type of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> or <code>multipart/form-data</code>. Programming languages or frameworks which have been designed to handle web-requests usually do \"The Right Thing\u2122\" with such requests and provide you with easy access to the readily decoded values (like <code>$_REQUEST</code> or <code>$_POST</code> in PHP, or <code>cgi.FieldStorage()</code>, <code>flask.request.form</code> in Python).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now let's digress a bit, which may help understand the difference ;)</p>\n\n<p>The difference between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests are largely semantic. They are also \"used\" differently, which explains the difference in how values are passed.</p>\n\n<h1>GET (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1\">relevant RFC section</a>)</h1>\n\n<p>When executing a <code>GET</code> request, you ask the server for one, or a set of entities. To allow the client to filter the result, it can use the so called \"query string\" of the URL. The query string is the part after the <code>?</code>. This is part of the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3\">URI syntax</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, from the point of view of your application code (the part which <em>receives</em> the request), you will need to inspect the URI query part to gain access to these values.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the keys and values are part of the URI. Browsers <em>may</em> impose a limit on URI length. The HTTP standard states that there is no limit. But at the time of this writing, most browsers <em>do</em> limit the URIs (I don't have specific values). <code>GET</code> requests should <em>never</em> be used to submit new information to the server. Especially not larger documents. That's where you should use <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>POST (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3\">relevant RFC section</a>)</h1>\n\n<p>When executing a <code>POST</code> request, the client is actually submitting a new <em>document</em> to the remote host. So, a <em>query</em> string does not (semantically) make sense. Which is why you don't have access to them in your application code.</p>\n\n<p><code>POST</code> is a little bit more complex (and <em>way</em> more flexible):</p>\n\n<p>When receiving a POST request, you should always expect a \"payload\", or, in HTTP terms: a <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3\">message body</a>. The message body in itself is pretty useless, as there is no <em>standard</em> (as far as I can tell. Maybe application/octet-stream?) format. The body format is defined by the <code>Content-Type</code> header. When using a HTML <code>FORM</code> element with <code>method=\"POST\"</code>, this is usually <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. Another very common type is <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388\">multipart/form-data</a> if you use file uploads. But is could be <em>anything</em>, ranging from <code>text/plain</code>, over <code>application/json</code> or even a custom <code>application/octet-stream</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, if a <code>POST</code> request is made with a <code>Content-Type</code> which cannot be handled by the application, it should return a <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.13\"><code>415</code> status-code</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most programming languages (and/or web-frameworks) offer a way to de/encode the message body from/to the most common types (like <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>multipart/form-data</code> or <code>application/json</code>). So that's easy. Custom types require potentially a bit more work.</p>\n\n<p>Using a standard HTML form encoded document as example, the application should perform the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read the <code>Content-Type</code> field</li>\n<li>If the value is not one of the supported media-types, then return a response with a <code>415</code> status code</li>\n<li>otherwise, decode the values from the message body.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, languages like PHP, or web-frameworks for other popular languages will probably handle this for you. The exception to this is the <code>415</code> error. No framework can predict which content-types your application chooses to support and/or not support. This is up to you.</p>\n\n<h1>PUT (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4\">relevant RFC section</a>)</h1>\n\n<p>A <code>PUT</code> request is pretty much handled in the exact same way as a <code>POST</code> request. The big difference is that a <code>POST</code> request is supposed to let the server decide how to (and if at all) create a new resource. Historically (from the now obsolete RFC2616 it was to create a new resource as a \"subordinate\" (child) of the URI where the request was sent to).</p>\n\n<p>A <code>PUT</code> request in contrast is supposed to \"deposit\" a resource exactly <em>at</em> that URI, and with <em>exactly</em> that content. No more, no less. The idea is that the <em>client</em> is responsible to craft the <em>complete</em> resource befor \"PUTting\" it. The server should accept it <em>as-is</em> on the given URL.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, a <code>POST</code> request is usually not used to <em>replace</em> an existing resource. A <code>PUT</code> request can do both create <em>and</em> replace.</p>\n\n<h1>Side-Note</h1>\n\n<p>There are also \"<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3\">path parameters</a>\" which can be used to send additional data to the remote, but they are so uncommon, that I won't go into too much detail here. But, for reference, here is an excerpt from the RFC:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aside from dot-segments in hierarchical paths, a path segment is considered\n  opaque by the generic syntax.  URI producing applications often use the\n  reserved characters allowed in a segment to delimit scheme-specific or\n  dereference-handler-specific subcomponents.  For example, the semicolon (\";\")\n  and equals (\"=\") reserved characters are often used to delimit parameters and\n  parameter values applicable to that segment.  The comma (\",\") reserved\n  character is often used for similar purposes.  For example, one URI producer\n  might use a segment such as \"name;v=1.1\" to indicate a reference to version\n  1.1 of \"name\", whereas another might use a segment such as \"name,1.1\" to\n  indicate the same.  Parameter types may be defined by scheme-specific\n  semantics, but in most cases the syntax of a parameter is specific to the\n  implementation of the URI's dereferencing algorithm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "How are parameters sent in an HTTP POST request?", "tags": ["http", "post", "parameters", "request", "uri"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14551194/how-are-parameters-sent-in-an-http-post-request/26717908#26717908", "question_id": 14551194, "answer_id": 26717908}, {"body": "<p>Some of the webservices require you to place request <em>data</em> and <em>metadata</em> separately.

So that's simple enough.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I have a webpage that lists snippets of digits for the purpose of verifying computations against them: <a href=\"http://www.numberworld.org/digits/Pi/\">http://www.numberworld.org/digits/Pi/</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But when you get into world-record territory, there's nothing to compare against.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, the standard approach for verifying that computed digits are correct is to recompute the digits using a second algorithm. So if either computation goes bad, the digits at the end won't match.</p>\n\n<p>This does typically more than double the amount of time needed (since the second algorithm is usually slower). But it's the only way to verify the computed digits once you've wandered into the uncharted territory of never-before-computed digits and a new world record.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Back in the days where supercomputers were setting the records, two different <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM_method\">AGM algorithms</a> were commonly used:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm\">Gauss\u2013Legendre algorithm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein%27s_algorithm\">Borwein's algorithm</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are both <code>O(N log(N)^2)</code> algorithms that were fairly easy to implement.</p>\n\n<p>However, nowadays, things are a bit different. In the last three world records, instead of performing two computations, we performed only one computation using the fastest known formula (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm\">Chudnovsky Formula</a>):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/bjkw6tu.png\" alt=\"Enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>This algorithm is much harder to implement, but it is a lot faster than the AGM algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Then we verify the binary digits using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula\">BBP formulas for digit extraction</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/b56zl9d.png\" alt=\"Enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>This formula allows you to compute arbitrary binary digits <em>without</em> computing all the digits before it. So it is used to verify the last few computed binary digits. Therefore it is <strong><em>much</em></strong> faster than a full computation.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of this is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Only one expensive computation is needed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The disadvantage is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>An implementation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula\">Bailey\u2013Borwein\u2013Plouffe</a> (BBP) formula is needed.</li>\n<li>An additional step is needed to verify the radix conversion from binary to decimal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><sub>I've glossed over some details of why verifying the last few digits implies that all the digits are correct. But it is easy to see this since any computation error will propagate to the last digits.</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now this last step (verifying the conversion) is actually fairly important. One of the previous world record holders <strong><em>actually called us out</em></strong> on this because, initially, I didn't give a sufficient description of how it worked.</p>\n\n<p>So I've pulled this snippet from my blog:</p>\n\n<pre><code>N = # of decimal digits desired\np = 64-bit prime number\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/csv4fyo.png\" alt=\"Enter image description here\"><br></p>\n\n<p>Compute A using base 10 arithmetic and B using binary arithmetic.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/cu4slf5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>If <code>A = B</code>, then with \"extremely high probability\", the conversion is correct.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For further reading, see my blog post <strong><a href=\"http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-5t/details.html\">Pi - 5 Trillion Digits</a></strong>.</p>\n", "title": "How to determine whether my calculation of pi is accurate?", "tags": ["algorithm", "math", "language-agnostic", "pi"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14283270/how-to-determine-whether-my-calculation-of-pi-is-accurate/14283481#14283481", "question_id": 14283270, "answer_id": 14283481}, {"body": "<p>Undoubtedly, for your purposes (which I assume is just a programming exercise), the best thing is to check your results against any of the listings of the digits of pi on the web.</p>\n\n<p>And how do we know that those values are correct?

If you want to add a library via Android Studio creator just check <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/16634680/2021293\">the answer</a> below with visual guide (there are some differences between Android Studio 1.0 and those from screenshots, but the process is very similar).</p>\n\n<p>Before you start adding a library to your project by hand, consider adding the external dependency. It won\u2019t mess in your project structure. Almost every well-known Android library is available in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\">Maven</a> repository and its installation takes only one line of code in the <code>app/build.gradle</code> file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dependencies {\n     compile 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:6.0.0'\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Adding the library</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is the full process of adding external Android library to our project:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new project via Android Studio creator. I named it <em>HelloWorld</em>.</li>\n<li>Here is the original project structure created by Android Studio:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>HelloWorld/\n      app/\n           - build.gradle  // local Gradle configuration (for app only)\n           ...\n      - build.gradle // Global Gradle configuration (for whole project)\n      - settings.gradle\n      - gradle.properties\n      ...\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>In the root directory (<code>HelloWorld/</code>), create new folder: <code>/libs</code> in which we\u2019ll place our external libraries (this step is not required - only for keeping a cleaner project structure).</li>\n<li>Paste your library in the newly created <code>/libs</code> folder. In this example I used <a href=\"https://github.com/astuetz/PagerSlidingTabStrip\">PagerSlidingTabStrip library</a> (just download ZIP from GitHub, rename library directory to \u201ePagerSlidingTabStrip\" and copy it). Here is the new structure of our project:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>HelloWorld/\n      app/\n           - build.gradle  // Local Gradle configuration (for app only)\n           ...\n      libs/\n           PagerSlidingTabStrip/\n                - build.gradle // Local Gradle configuration (for library only)\n      - build.gradle // Global Gradle configuration (for whole project)\n      - settings.gradle\n      - gradle.properties\n      ...\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><p>Edit settings.gradle by adding your library to <code>include</code>. If you use a custom path like I did, you have also to define the project directory for our library. A whole settings.gradle should look like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>include ':app', ':PagerSlidingTabStrip'\nproject(':PagerSlidingTabStrip').projectDir = new File('libs/PagerSlidingTabStrip')\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>5.1 If you face \"Default Configuration\" error, then try this instead of step 5,</p>\n\n<pre><code>    include ':app'\n    include ':libs:PagerSlidingTabStrip'\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><p>In <code>app/build.gradle</code> add our library project as an dependency:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dependencies {\n    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'\n    compile project(\":PagerSlidingTabStrip\")\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>6.1. If you followed step 5.1, then follow this instead of 6,</p>\n\n<pre><code>    dependencies {\n        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n        compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'\n\n        compile project(\":libs:PagerSlidingTabStrip\")\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><p>If your library project doesn\u2019t have <code>build.gradle</code> file you have to create it manually. Here is example of that file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    apply plugin: 'com.android.library'\n\n    dependencies {\n        compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:21.0.3'\n    }\n\n    android {\n        compileSdkVersion 21\n        buildToolsVersion \"21.1.2\"\n\n        defaultConfig {\n            minSdkVersion 14\n            targetSdkVersion 21\n        }\n\n        sourceSets {\n            main {\n                manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'\n                java.srcDirs = ['src']\n                res.srcDirs = ['res']\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Additionally you can create a global configuration for your project which will contain SDK versions and build tools version for every module to keep consistency. Just edit <code>gradle.properties</code> file and add lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ANDROID_BUILD_MIN_SDK_VERSION=14\nANDROID_BUILD_TARGET_SDK_VERSION=21\nANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION=21.1.3\nANDROID_BUILD_SDK_VERSION=21\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can use it in your <code>build.gradle</code> files (in app and libraries modules) like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//...\nandroid {\n    compileSdkVersion Integer.parseInt(project.ANDROID_BUILD_SDK_VERSION)\n    buildToolsVersion project.ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION\n\n    defaultConfig {\n        minSdkVersion Integer.parseInt(project.ANDROID_BUILD_MIN_SDK_VERSION)\n        targetSdkVersion Integer.parseInt(project.ANDROID_BUILD_TARGET_SDK_VERSION)\n    }\n}\n//...\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>That\u2019s all. Just click\u201a synchronise the project with the Gradle\u2019 icon <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QH01w.png\" alt=\"synchronise with Gradle\">.

I just want the last 3 or 4 for rollbacks and to get rid of everything else. Unix's <code>tail</code> is your best friend here. Since <code>docker images</code> and <code>docker ps</code> both order by date, we can just use <code>tail</code> to select all but the top 3 and remove them:</p>\n\n<pre><code>docker rmi $(docker images -q | tail -n +4)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Run that along with your deploy scripts (or locally) to always keep just enough images to comfortably roll back without taking up too much room or cluttering stuff up with old images.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I only keep one container on my production box at any time, but you can do the same sort of thing with containers if you want more:</p>\n\n<pre><code>docker rm $(docker ps -aq | tail -n +4)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, in my simplified example we're only dealing with one repo at a time, but if you had more, you can just get a bit more sophisticated with the same idea. Say I just want to keep the last 3 images from some_repo/some_image. I can just mix in <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code> and be on my way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>docker rmi $(docker images -a | grep 'some_repo/some_image' | awk '{print $3}' | tail -n +4)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, same idea applies to containers, but you get it by this point so I'll stop giving examples.</p>\n", "title": "How to remove old Docker containers", "tags": ["docker"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17236796/how-to-remove-old-docker-containers/27651508#27651508", "question_id": 17236796, "answer_id": 27651508}, {"body": "<p>To remove ALL containers without crying:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo docker ps -a | grep -v CONTAINER | awk '{print $1}' | xargs --no-run-if-empty sudo docker rm -f\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to remove old Docker containers", "tags": ["docker"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17236796/how-to-remove-old-docker-containers/28357967#28357967", "question_id": 17236796, "answer_id": 28357967}, {"body": "<p>Composing several different hints above, the most elegant way to remove all non-running containers seems to be:</p>\n\n<p><code>docker rm $(docker ps -q -f status=exited)</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>-q</code> prints just the container ids (without column headers)</li>\n<li><code>-f</code> allows you to filter your list of printed containers (in this case we are filtering to only show exited containers)</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "How to remove old Docker containers", "tags": ["docker"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17236796/how-to-remove-old-docker-containers/29474367#29474367", "question_id": 17236796, "answer_id": 29474367}, {"body": "<p>For anyone interested, I took the example from qkrijger and turned it into a clear all (stop and remove all)</p>\n\n<pre><code>docker stop `docker ps --no-trunc -aq` ; docker rm `docker ps --no-trunc -aq`\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to remove old Docker containers", "tags": ["docker"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17236796/how-to-remove-old-docker-containers/29531081#29531081", "question_id": 17236796, "answer_id": 29531081}, {"body": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/HardySimpson/docker-cleanup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/HardySimpson/docker-cleanup</a></p>\n\n<h1>Docker cleanup</h1>\n\n<p>A tiny all-in-one shell, which removes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Containers that not running more than one day ago</li>\n<li>Images that don't belong to any remaining container</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Intend to run as a crontab job</p>\n\n<h2>Feature</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It will remove all <code>&lt;none&gt;:&lt;none&gt;</code> images</li>\n<li>If the image has multiple repo:tag references to it, it will remove all repo:tag except with running a container.

The build system automatically takes all the source files (<code>.java</code> or <code>.xml</code>), then applies the appropriate tool (e.g. takes <code>java</code> class files and converts them to <code>dex</code> files), and groups all of them into one compressed file, our beloved APK.</p>\n\n<p>This build system uses some conventions: an example of one is to specify the directory containing the source files (in Eclipse it is <code>\\src</code> folder) or resources files (in Eclipse it is <code>\\res</code> folder).</p>\n\n<p>Now, in order to automate all these tasks, there has to be a script; you can write your own build system using shell scripting in linux or batch files syntax in windows. Got it?</p>\n\n<p>Gradle is another <strong>build system</strong> that takes the best features from other build systems and combines them into one. It is improved based off of their shortcomings.\nIt is a <strong>JVM based build system</strong>, what that means is that you can write your own script in Java, which Android Studio makes use of.</p>\n\n<p>One cool thing about gradle is that it is a <strong>plugin based system</strong>. This means if you have your own programming language and you want to automate the task of building some package (output like a JAR for Java) from sources then you can write a complete plugin in Java or Groovy, and distribute it to rest of world.</p>\n\n<h3>Why did Google use it?</h3>\n\n<p>Google saw one of the most advanced build systems on the market and realized that you could write scripts of your own with little to no learning curve, and without learning Groovy or any other new language. So they wrote the Android plugin for Gradle.</p>\n\n<p>You must have seen <code>build.gradle</code> file(s) in your project. That is where you can write scripts to automate your tasks. The code you saw in these files is Groovy code. If you write <code>System.out.println(\"Hello Gradle!\");</code> then it will print on your console.</p>\n\n<h3>What can you do in a build script?</h3>\n\n<p>A simple example is that you have to copy some files from one directory to another before the actual build process happens.

The Android Studio gives no useful help or tips as to how to solve the problem. It doesn't tell you where you can manually look in the Eclipse folders.

Or help you search Maven etc. for them.</p>\n\n<p>In 2016 things like Leiningen / Clojars, or node's npm, or Python's pip, or the Debian apkg (and I'm sure many similar package managers for other languages and systems) all work beautifully ... missing dependencies are thing of the past.</p>\n\n<p>Except with Android. Android Studio is now the only place where I still seem to experience missing-dependency hell. </p>\n\n<p>I'm inclined to say this is Google's fault. They broke the Android ecosystem (and thousands of existing Android projects / online tutorials) when they cavalierly decided to shift from Eclipse to Android Studio / Gradle without producing a robust conversion process.

And people trying to use those projects in AS are hitting the same issues.</p>\n\n<p>And anyway, if Gradle is this super-powerful build system, why am I still managing a whole lot of other dependencies in the sdk manager? Why can't a project that needs, say, the ndk specify this in its Gradle file so that it gets automatically installed and built-against when needed? Why is NDK special? Similarly for target platforms?

It won't work unless you reset the boolean to false, then $digest, then reset it back to true. Even if you use a string comparison in your expression, you'll be forced to change the string to something else, $digest, then change it back.</strike> (This has been addressed with the blur event handler.)</p>\n\n<p>So I propose this alternate solution:</p>\n\n<h3>Use an event, the forgotten feature of Angular.</h3>\n\n<p>JavaScript loves events after all. Events are inherently loosely coupled, and even better, you avoid adding another $watch to your $digest.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>app.directive('focusOn', function() {\n   return function(scope, elem, attr) {\n      scope.$on(attr.focusOn, function(e) {\n          elem[0].focus();\n      });\n   };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now you could use it like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;input type=\"text\" focus-on=\"newItemAdded\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then anywhere in your app... </p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$scope.addNewItem = function () {\n    /* stuff here to add a new item... */\n\n    $scope.$broadcast('newItemAdded');\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is awesome because you can do all sorts of things with something like this. For one, you could tie into events that already exist. For another thing you start doing something smart by having different parts of your app publish events that other parts of your app can subscribe to.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, this type of thing screams \"event driven\" to me.

Simply put, a CommonJS implementation might work like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// someModule.js\nexports.doSomething = function() { return \"foo\"; };\n\n//otherModule.js\nvar someModule = require('someModule'); // in the vein of node    \nexports.doSomethingElse = function() { return someModule.doSomething() + \"bar\"; };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically, CommonJS specifies that you need to have a <code>require()</code> function to fetch dependencies, an <code>exports</code> variable to export module contents and a module identifier (which describes the location of the module in question in relation to this module) that is used to require the dependencies(<a href=\"http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1\">source</a>). CommonJS has various implementations, including <strong>Node.js</strong>, which you mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>CommonJS was not particularly designed with browsers in mind, so it doesn't fit in the browser environment very well (<em>I really have no source for this--it just says so everywhere, including <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html\">the RequireJS site.</em></a>). Apparently, this has something to do with asynchronous loading, etc. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, RequireJS implements AMD, which is designed to suit the browser environment(<a href=\"https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD\">source</a>). Apparently, AMD started as an spinoff of the CommonJS Transport format and evolved into its own module definition API. Hence the similarities between the two. The new feature in AMD is the <code>define()</code> -function that allows the module to declare its dependencies before being loaded. For example, the definition could be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>define('module/id/string', ['module', 'dependency', 'array'], \nfunction(module, factory function) {\n  return ModuleContents;  \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, CommonJS and AMD are <strong>JavaScript</strong> module definition APIs that have different implementations, but both come from the same origins.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AMD</strong> is more suited for the browser, because it supports asynchronous loading of module dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>RequireJS</strong> is an implementation of <strong>AMD</strong>, while at the same time trying to keep the spirit of <strong>CommonJS</strong> (mainly in the module identifiers).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To confuse you even more, RequireJS, while being an AMD implementation, offers a CommonJS wrapper so CommonJS modules can almost directly be imported into use with RequireJS.</p>\n\n<pre><code>define(function(require, exports, module) {\n  var someModule = require('someModule'); // in the vein of node    \n  exports.doSomethingElse = function() { return someModule.doSomething() + \"bar\"; };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hope this helped to clarify things!</p>\n", "title": "Relation between CommonJS, AMD and RequireJS?", "tags": ["javascript", "module", "requirejs", "amd", "commonjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16521471/relation-between-commonjs-amd-and-requirejs/16522990#16522990", "question_id": 16521471, "answer_id": 16522990}, {"body": "<h1>The short answer would be:</h1>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules\">CommonJS</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/amdjs\">AMD</a></strong> are specifications (or formats) on how modules and their dependencies should be declared in javascript applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a></strong> is a script loader library that is AMD compliant, <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/curljs\">curljs</a> being another example.</p>\n\n<h2>CommonJS compliant:</h2>\n\n<p>Taken from <a href=\"http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailcommonjs\">Addy Osmani's book</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// package/lib is a dependency we require\nvar lib = require( \"package/lib\" );\n\n// behavior for our module\nfunction foo(){\n    lib.log( \"hello world!\" );\n}\n\n// export (expose) foo to other modules as foobar\nexports.foobar = foo;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>AMD compliant:</h2>\n\n<pre><code>// package/lib is a dependency we require\ndefine([\"package/lib\"], function (lib) {\n\n    // behavior for our module\n    function foo() {\n        lib.log( \"hello world!\" );\n    }\n\n    // export (expose) foo to other modules as foobar\n    return {\n        foobar: foo\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Somewhere else the module can be used with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require([\"package/myModule\"], function(myModule) {\n    myModule.foobar();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Some background:</h1>\n\n<p>Actually, <a href=\"http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS\">CommonJS</a> is much more than an API declaration and only a part of it deals with that.

Ternary operator:</h3>\n\n<p>As suggested by @Kirk in the comments, the cleanest way of doing this would be to use a ternary operator as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;span&gt;{{isLarge ? 'video.large' : 'video.small'}}&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>2. <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngSwitch\"><code>ng-switch</code></a> directive:</h3>\n\n<p>can be used something like the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-switch on=\"video\"&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-switch-when=\"video.large\"&gt;\n        &lt;!-- code to render a large video block--&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-switch-default&gt;\n        &lt;!-- code to render the regular video block --&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>3. <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngHide\"><code>ng-hide</code></a> / <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngShow\"><code>ng-show</code></a> directives</h3>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you might also use <code>ng-show/ng-hide</code> but using this will actually render both a large video and a small video element and then hide the one that meets the <code>ng-hide</code> condition and shows the one that meets <code>ng-show</code> condition. So on each page you'll actually be rendering two different elements.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Another option to consider is <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngClass\"><code>ng-class</code></a> directive.</h3>\n\n<p>This can be used as follows.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-class=\"{large-video: video.large}\"&gt;\n    &lt;!-- video block goes here --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above basically will add a <code>large-video</code> css class to the div element if <code>video.large</code> is truthy.</p>\n\n<h3>UPDATE: <a href=\"http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.5/docs/\">Angular 1.1.5</a> introduced the <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngIf\"><code>ngIf directive</code></a></h3>\n\n<h3>5. <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.directive:ngIf\"><code>ng-if</code></a> directive:</h3>\n\n<p>In the versions above <code>1.1.5</code> you can use the <code>ng-if</code> directive.

First, lets start with primitive types and <code>void</code>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the class object represents a primitive type or <code>void</code>, all the four methods simply returns its name.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now the rules for the <code>getName()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Every non-lambda and non-array class or interface (i.e, top-level, nested, inner, local and anonymous) has a name (which is returned by <code>getName()</code>) that is the package name followed by a dot (if there is a package), followed by the name of its class-file as generated by the compiler (whithout the suffix <code>.class</code>). If there is no package, it is simply the name of the class-file. If the class is an inner, nested, local or anonymous class, the compiler should generate at least one <code>$</code> in its class-file name. Note that for anonymous classes, the class name would end with a dollar-sign followed by a number.</li>\n<li>Lambda class names are generally unpredictable, and you shouldn't care about they anyway. Exactly, their name is the name of the enclosing class, followed by <code>$$Lambda$</code>, followed by a number, followed by a slash, followed by another number.</li>\n<li>The class descriptor of the primitives are <code>Z</code> for <code>boolean</code>, <code>B</code> for <code>byte</code>, <code>S</code> for <code>short</code>, <code>C</code> for <code>char</code>, <code>I</code> for <code>int</code>, <code>J</code> for <code>long</code>, <code>F</code> for <code>float</code> and <code>D</code> for <code>double</code>. For non-array classes and interfaces the class descriptor is <code>L</code> followed by what is given by <code>getName()</code> followed by <code>;</code>. For array classes, the class descriptor is <code>[</code> followed by the class descriptor of the component type (which may be itself another array class).</li>\n<li>For array classes, the <code>getName()</code> method returns its class descriptor. This rule seems to fail only for array classes whose the component type is a lambda (which possibly is a bug), but hopefully this should not matter anyway because there is no point even on the existence of array classes whose component type is a lambda.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, the <code>toString()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>If the class instance represents an interface (or an annotation, which is a special type of interface), the <code>toString()</code> returns <code>\"interface \" + getName()</code>. If it is a primitive, it returns simply <code>getName()</code>. If it is something else (a class type, even if it is a pretty weird one), it returns <code>\"class \" + getName()</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>For top-level classes and interfaces, the <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns just what the <code>getName()</code> method returns.</li>\n<li>The <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns <code>null</code> for anonymous or local classes and for array classes of those.</li>\n<li>For inner and nested classes and interfaces, the <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns what the <code>getName()</code> method would replacing the compiler-introduced dollar-signs by dots.</li>\n<li>For array classes, the <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns <code>null</code> if the canonical name of the component type is <code>null</code>. Otherwise, it returns the canonical name of the component type followed by <code>[]</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The <code>getSimpleName()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>For top-level, nested, inner and local classes, the <code>getSimpleName()</code> returns the name of the class as written in the source file.</li>\n<li>For anonymous classes the <code>getSimpleName()</code> returns an empty <code>String</code>.</li>\n<li>For lambda classes the <code>getSimpleName()</code> just returns what the <code>getName()</code> would return without the package name. This do not makes much sense and looks like a bug for me, but there is no point in calling <code>getSimpleName()</code> on a lambda class to start with.</li>\n<li>For array classes the <code>getSimpleName()</code> method returns the simple name of the component class followed by <code>[]</code>. This have the funny/weird side-effect that array classes whose component type is an anonymous class have just <code>[]</code> as their simple names.</li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "What is the difference between canonical name, simple name and class name in Java Class?", "tags": ["java"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15202997/what-is-the-difference-between-canonical-name-simple-name-and-class-name-in-jav/29527145#29527145", "question_id": 15202997, "answer_id": 29527145}, {"body": "<p>I've been confused by the wide range of different naming schemes as well, and was just about to ask and answer my own question on this when I found this question here.

However, registers are very expensive and most computer cores have less than a few dozen registers (few hundred to maybe a thousand <em>bytes</em> total).  At the other end of the memory spectrum (<strong>DRAM</strong>), the memory is very cheap (i.e. literally <em>millions of times cheaper</em>) but takes hundreds of cycles after a request to receive the data.  To bridge this gap between super fast and expensive and super slow and cheap are the <strong>cache memories</strong>, named L1, L2, L3 in decreasing speed and cost. The idea is that most of the executing code will be hitting a small set of variables often, and the rest (a much larger set of variables) infrequently. If the processor can't find the data in L1 cache, then it looks in L2 cache. If not there, then L3 cache, and if not there, main memory. Each of these \"misses\" is expensive in time.</p>\n\n<p>(The analogy is cache memory is to system memory, as system memory is to hard disk storage. Hard disk storage is super cheap, but very slow).</p>\n\n<p>Caching is one of the main methods to reduce the impact of <em>latency</em> (cfr. the Herb Sutter talk I linked at the start). To paraphrase Herb Sutter (cfr. links below): <strong>increasing bandwidth is easy, but we can't buy our way out of latency</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Data is always retrieved through the memory hierarchy (smallest == fastest to slowest). A <em>cache hit/miss</em> usually refers to a hit/miss in the highest level of cache in the CPU -- by highest level I mean the largest == slowest. The cache hit rate is crucial for performance, since every cache miss results in fetching data from RAM (or worse ...) which takes <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of time (hundreds of cycles for RAM, tens of millions of cycles for HDD). In comparison, reading data from the (highest level) cache typically takes only a handful of cycles.</p>\n\n<p>In modern computer architectures, the performance bottleneck is leaving the CPU die (e.g. accessing RAM or higher). This will only get worse over time. The increase in processor frequency is currently no longer relevant to increase performance. <strong>The problem is memory access.</strong> Hardware design efforts in CPUs therefore currently focus heavily on optimizing caches, prefetching, pipelines and concurrency. For instance, modern CPUs spend around 85% of die on caches and up to 99% for storing/moving data!</p>\n\n<p>There is quite a lot to be said on the subject. Here are a few great references about caches, memory hierarchies and proper programming:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.agner.org/optimize/\">Agner Fog's page</a>. In his excellent documents, you can find detailed examples covering languages ranging from assembly to C++. </li>\n<li>If you are into videos, I strongly recommend to have a look at  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7zSU9HI-6I\">Herb Sutter's talk on machine architecture (youtube)</a> (specifically check 12:00 and onwards!).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.research.scea.com/research/pdfs/GDC2003_Memory_Optimization_18Mar03.pdf\">Slides about memory optimization by Christer Ericson</a> (director of technology @ Sony)</li>\n<li>LWN.net's article <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/\">\"<em>What every programmer should know about memory</em>\"</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Main concepts for cache-friendly code</h2>\n\n<p>A very important aspect of cache-friendly code is all about <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference\">the principle of locality</a></strong>, the goal of which is to place related data close in memory to allow efficient caching. In terms of the CPU cache, it's important to be aware of cache lines to understand how this works: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3928995/how-do-cache-lines-work\">How do cache lines work?</a> </p>\n\n<p>The following particular aspects are of high importance to optimize caching:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Temporal locality</strong>: when a given memory location was accessed, it is likely that the same location is accessed again in the near future. Ideally, this information will still be cached at that point.</li>\n<li><strong>Spatial locality</strong>: this refers to placing related data close to eachother. Caching happens on many levels, not just in the CPU. For example, when you read from RAM, typically a larger chunk of memory is fetched than what was specifically asked for because very often the program will require that data soon. HDD caches follow the same line of thought. Specifically for CPU caches, the notion of <em>cache lines</em> is important.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Use appropriate <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a> containers</strong></p>\n\n<p>A simple example of cache-friendly versus cache-unfriendly is <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>'s <code>std::vector</code> versus <code>std::list</code>. Elements of a <code>std::vector</code> are stored in contiguous memory, and as such accessing them is <em>much</em> more cache-friendly than accessing elements in a <code>std::list</code>, which stores its content all over the place. This is due to spatial locality.</p>\n\n<p>A very nice illustration of this is given by Bjarne Stroustrup in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo\">this youtube clip</a> (thanks to @Mohammad Ali Baydoun for the link!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't neglect the cache in data structure and algorithm design</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whenever possible, try to adapt your data structures and order of computations in a way that allows maximum use of the cache. An common technique in this regard is <a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/cs267/mg/report/node35.html\">cache blocking</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140113145619/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/cs267/mg/report/node35.html\">(Archive.org version)</a>, which is of extreme importance in high-performance computing (cfr. for example <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software\">ATLAS</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Know and exploit the implicit structure of data</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another simple example, which many people in the field sometimes forget is column-major (ex. <a href=\"/questions/tagged/fortran\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;fortran&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">fortran</a>,<a href=\"/questions/tagged/matlab\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;matlab&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">matlab</a>) vs. row-major ordering (ex. <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c</a>,<a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>) for storing two dimensional arrays. For example, consider the following matrix:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1 2\n3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In row-major ordering, this is stored in memory as <code>1 2 3 4</code>; in column-major ordering this would be stored as <code>1 3 2 4</code>. It is easy to see that implementations which do not exploit this ordering will quickly run into (easily avoidable!) cache issues. Unfortunately, I see stuff like this <em>very</em> often in my domain (machine learning). @MatteoItalia showed this example in more detail in his answer.</p>\n\n<p>When fetching a certain element of a matrix from memory, elements near it will be fetched as well and stored in a cache line. If the ordering is exploited, this will result in fewer memory accesses (because the next few values which are needed for subsequent computations are already in a cache line). </p>\n\n<p>For simplicity, assume the cache comprises a single cache line which can contain 2 matrix elements and that when a given element is fetched from memory, the next one is too. Say we want to take the sum over all elements in the example 2x2 matrix above (lets call it <code>M</code>):</p>\n\n<p>Exploiting the ordering (e.g. changing column index first in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>): </p>\n\n<pre><code>M[0][0] (memory) + M[0][1] (cached) + M[1][0] (memory) + M[1][1] (cached)\n= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n--&gt; 2 cache hits, 2 memory accesses\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not exploiting the ordering (e.g. changing row index first in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>M[0][0] (memory) + M[1][0] (memory) + M[0][1] (memory) + M[1][1] (memory)\n= 1 + 3 + 2 + 4\n--&gt; 0 cache hits, 4 memory accesses\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this simple example, exploiting the ordering approximately doubles execution speed (since memory access requires much more cycles than computing the sums). In practice the performance difference can be <em>much</em> larger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoid unpredictable branches</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modern architectures feature pipelines and compilers are becoming very good at reordering code to minimize delays due to memory access. When your critical code contains (unpredictable) branches, it is hard or impossible to prefetch data. This will indirectly lead to more cache misses.</p>\n\n<p>This is explained <em>very</em> well here (thanks to @0x90 for the link): <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-an-unsorted-array\">Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoid virtual functions</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the context of <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>, <code>virtual</code> methods represent a controversial issue with regard to cache misses (a general consensus exists that they should be avoided when possible in terms of performance). Virtual functions can induce cache misses during look up, but this only happens <em>if</em> the specific function is not called often (otherwise it would likely be cached), so this is regarded as a non-issue by some. For reference about this issue, check out: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/667634/what-is-the-performance-cost-of-having-a-virtual-method-in-a-c-class\">What is the performance cost of having a virtual method in a C++ class?</a> </p>\n\n<h2>Common problems</h2>\n\n<p>A common problem in modern architectures with multiprocessor caches is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing\">false sharing</a>. This occurs when each individual processor is attempting to use data in another memory region and attempts to store it in the same <em>cache line</em>. This causes the cache line -- which contains data another processor can use -- to be overwritten again and again. Effectively, different threads make each other wait by inducing cache misses in this situation.\nSee also (thanks to @Matt for the link): <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8469427/how-and-when-to-align-to-cache-line-size\">How and when to align to cache line size?</a></p>\n\n<p>An extreme symptom of poor caching in RAM memory (which is probably not what you mean in this context) is so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_%28computer_science%29\">thrashing</a>.

Locality of reference really has two dimensions though: space and time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spatial</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The spatial dimension also comes down to two things: first, we want to pack our information densely, so more information will fit in that limited memory. This means (for example) that you need a major improvement in computational complexity to justify data structures based on small nodes joined by pointers.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we want information that will be processed together also located together. A typical cache works in \"lines\", which means when you access some information, other information at nearby addresses will be loaded into the cache with the part we touched. For example, when I touch one byte, the cache might load 128 or 256 bytes near that one. To take advantage of that, you generally want the data arranged to maximize the likelihood that you'll also use that other data that was loaded at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>For just a really trivial example, this can mean that a linear search can be much more competitive with a binary search than you'd expect. Once you've loaded one item from a cache line, using the rest of the data in that cache line is almost free. A binary search becomes noticeably faster only when the data is large enough that the binary search reduces the number of cache lines you access.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The time dimension means that when you do some operations on some data, you want (as much as possible) to do all the operations on that data at once.</p>\n\n<p>Since you've tagged this as C++, I'll point to a classic example of a relatively cache-unfriendly design: <code>std::valarray</code>. <code>valarray</code> overloads most arithmetic operators, so I can (for example) say <code>a = b + c + d;</code> (where <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> are all valarrays) to do element-wise addition of those arrays.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that it walks through one pair of inputs, puts results in a temporary, walks through another pair of inputs, and so on. With a lot of data, the result from one computation may disappear from the cache before it's used in the next computation, so we end up reading (and writing) the data repeatedly before we get our final result. If each element of the final result will be something like <code>(a[n] + b[n]) * (c[n] + d[n]);</code>, we'd generally prefer to read each <code>a[n]</code>, <code>b[n]</code>, <code>c[n]</code> and <code>d[n]</code> once, do the computation, write the result, increment <code>n</code> and repeat 'til we're done.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<h1>Line Sharing</h1>\n\n<p>The second major factor is avoiding line sharing. To understand this, we probably need to back up and look a little at how caches are organized. The simplest form of cache is direct mapped. This means one address in main memory can only be stored in one specific spot in the cache. If we're using two data items that map to the same spot in the cache, it works badly -- each time we use one data item, the other has to be flushed from the cache to make room for the other. The rest of the cache might be empty, but those items won't use other parts of the cache.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent this, most caches are what are called \"set associative\". For example, in a 4-way set-associative cache, any item from main memory can be stored at any of 4 different places in the cache. So, when the cache is going to load an item, it looks for the least recently used<sup>3</sup> item among those four, flushes it to main memory, and loads the new item in its place.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is probably fairly obvious: for a direct-mapped cache, two operands that happen to map to the same cache location can lead to bad behavior. An N-way set-associative cache increases the number from 2 to N+1. Organizing a cache into more \"ways\" takes extra circuitry and generally runs slower, so (for example) an 8192-way set associative cache is rarely a good solution either.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this factor is more difficult to control in portable code though. Your control over where your data is placed is usually fairly limited. Worse, the exact mapping from address to cache varies between otherwise similar processors. In some cases, however, it can be worth doing things like allocating a large buffer, and then using only parts of what you allocated to ensure against data sharing the same cache lines (even though you'll probably need to detect the exact processor and act accordingly to do this).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>False Sharing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There's another, related item called \"false sharing\". This arises in a multiprocessor or multicore system, where two (or more) processors/cores have data that's separate, but falls in the same cache line. This forces the two processors/cores to coordinate their access to the data, even though each has its own, separate data item. Especially if the two modify the data in alternation, this can lead to a massive slowdown as the data has to be constantly shuttled between the processors. This can't easily be cured by organizing the cache into more \"ways\" or anything like that either. The primary way to prevent it is to ensure that two threads rarely (preferably never) modify data that could possibly be in the same cache line (with the same caveats about difficulty of controlling the addresses at which data is allocated).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Those who know C++ well might wonder if this is open to optimization via something like expression templates. I'm pretty sure the answer is that yes, it could be done and if it was, it would probably be a pretty substantial win. I'm not aware of anybody having done so, however, and given how little <code>valarray</code> gets used, I'd be at least a little surprised to see anybody do so either.</p></li>\n<li><p>In case anybody wonders how <code>valarray</code> (designed specifically for performance) could be this badly wrong, it comes down to one thing: it was really designed for machines like the older Crays, that used fast main memory and no cache. For them, this really was a nearly ideal design.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes, I'm simplifying: most caches don't really measure the least recently used item precisely, but they use some heuristic that's intended to be close to that without having to keep a full time-stamp for each access.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "What is &quot;cache-friendly&quot; code?", "tags": ["c++", "performance", "caching", "memory", "cpu-cache"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16699247/what-is-cache-friendly-code/16863451#16863451", "question_id": 16699247, "answer_id": 16863451}, {"body": "<p>It needs to be clarified that not only data should be cache-friendly, it is just as important for the code.

Here is an explanation with examples:</p>\n\n<h2>1) DRYing up model codes</h2>\n\n<p>Consider a Article model, a Event model and a Comment model. An article or an event has many comments. A comment belongs to either Article or Event. </p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, the models may look like this:</p>\n\n<p>Comment Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Article Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :comments, as: :commentable \n\n  def find_first_comment\n    comments.first(created_at DESC)\n  end\n\n  def self.least_commented\n   #return the article with least number of comments\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Event Model</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :comments, as: :commentable \n\n  def find_first_comment\n    comments.first(created_at DESC)\n  end\n\n  def self.least_commented\n   #returns the event with least number of comments\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As we can notice, there is a significant piece of code common to both Event and Article. Using concerns we can extract this common code in a separate module Commentable. </p>\n\n<p>For this create a commentable.rb file in app/models/concerns.</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Commentable\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n\n  included do\n    has_many :comments, as: :commentable\n  end\n\n  # for the given article/event returns the first comment\n  def find_first_comment\n    comments.first(created_at DESC)\n  end\n\n  module ClassMethods\n    def least_commented\n      #returns the article/event which has the least number of comments\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now your models look like this :</p>\n\n<p>Comment Model: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Article Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  include Commentable\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Event Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  include Commentable\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>2) Skin-nizing Fat Models.</h2>\n\n<p>Consider a Event model. A event has many attenders and comments.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, the event model might look like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   \n  has_many :comments\n  has_many :attenders\n\n\n  def find_first_comment\n    # for the given article/event returns the first comment\n  end\n\n  def find_comments_with_word(word)\n    # for the given event returns an array of comments which contain the given word\n  end \n\n  def self.least_commented\n    # finds the event which has the least number of comments\n  end\n\n  def self.most_attended\n    # returns the event with most number of attendes\n  end\n\n  def has_attendee(attendee_id)\n    # returns true if the event has the mentioned attendee\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Models with many associations and otherwise have tendency to accumulate more and more code and become unmanageable. Concerns provide a way to skin-nize fat modules making them more modularized and easy to understand. </p>\n\n<p>The above model can be refactored using concerns as below:\nCreate a <code>attendable.rd</code> and <code>commentable.rb</code> file in app/models/concerns/event folder</p>\n\n<p>attendable.rb</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Attendable\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n\n  included do \n    has_many :attenders\n  end\n\n  def has_attender(attender_id)\n    # returns true if the event has the mentioned attendee\n  end\n\n  module ClassMethods\n    def most_attended\n      # returns the event with most number of attendes\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>commentable.rb</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Commentable\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n\n  included do \n    has_many :comments\n  end\n\n  def find_first_comment\n    # for the given article/event returns the first comment\n  end\n\n  def find_comments_with_word(word)\n    # for the given event returns an array of comments which contain the given word\n  end\n\n  module ClassMethods\n    def least_commented\n      # finds the event which has the least number of comments\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now using Concerns, your Event model reduces to </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  include Commentable\n  include Attendable\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>* While using concerns its advisable to go for 'domain' based grouping rather than 'technical' grouping.

Concerns will inject them appropriately for you. Thats one advantage of using <code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Handle module dependencies gracefully.</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Foo\n  def self.included(base)\n    base.class_eval do\n      def self.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n        ...\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nmodule Bar\n  def self.included(base)\n    base.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n  end\nend\n\nclass Host\n  include Foo # We need to include this dependency for Bar\n  include Bar # Bar is the module that Host really needs\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example <code>Bar</code> is the module that <code>Host</code> really needs. But since <code>Bar</code> has dependency with <code>Foo</code> the <code>Host</code> class have to <code>include Foo</code> (but wait why <code>Host</code> want to know about <code>Foo</code> ? can it be avoided ?).</p>\n\n<p>So <code>Bar</code> adds dependency everywhere it goes. And <strong>order of inclusion also matters here.</strong> This adds lot of complexity/dependency to huge code base.</p>\n\n<p>After refactoring with <code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>require 'active_support/concern'\n\nmodule Foo\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n  included do\n    def self.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n      ...\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nmodule Bar\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n  include Foo\n\n  included do\n    self.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n  end\nend\n\nclass Host\n  include Bar # It works, now Bar takes care of its dependencies\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now it looks simple.</p>\n\n<p>If you are thinking why cant we add <code>Foo</code> dependency in <code>Bar</code> module itself ? That wont work since <code>method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass</code> have to be injected in class thats including <code>Bar</code> not on <code>Bar</code> module itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html\">Rails ActiveSupport::Concern</a></p>\n", "title": "How to use concerns in Rails 4", "tags": ["ruby-on-rails", "ruby-on-rails-4", "dci"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541823/how-to-use-concerns-in-rails-4/34061862#34061862", "question_id": 14541823, "answer_id": 34061862}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541823/how-to-use-concerns-in-rails-4", "question_id": 14541823}, {"body": "<p>In my controller, I have data like:\n<code>$scope.object = data</code></p>\n\n<p>Now this data is the dictionary with keys and values from <code>json</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I can access the attribute with <code>object.name</code> in the template.

I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.</p>\n\n<p>One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about \"big data\" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought is to use <code>HDFStore</code> to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:</p>\n\n<p>What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure</li>\n<li>Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure</li>\n<li>Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on \"large data\".</p>\n\n<p>Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.</li>\n<li>In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.</li>\n<li>I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.</li>\n<li>I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.</li>\n<li>Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, <code>if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'</code>.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.</li>\n<li>Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.</li>\n<li>A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.</li>\n<li>It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.</li>\n<li>The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).</p>\n", "title": "&quot;Large data&quot; work flows using pandas", "tags": ["python", "mongodb", "pandas", "large-data", "hdf5"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>I routinely use tens of gigabytes of data in just this fashion\ne.g. I have tables on disk that I read via queries, create data and append back.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth reading <a href=\"http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/io.html#hdf5-pytables\">the docs</a> and <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/pydata/cmw1F3OFJSc\">late in this thread</a> for several suggestions for how to store your data.</p>\n\n<p>Details which will affect how you store your data, like:<br>\n<em>Give as much detail as you can; and I can help you develop a structure.</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Size of data, # of rows, columns, types of columns; are you appending\nrows, or just columns? </li>\n<li>What will typical operations look like.

I think I may be able to fix this limitation in the future... this is more intuitive anyhow):<br>\n(The following is pseudocode.)</p>\n\n<pre><code>import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# create a store\nstore = pd.HDFStore('mystore.h5')\n\n# this is the key to your storage:\n#    this maps your fields to a specific group, and defines \n#    what you want to have as data_columns.\n#    you might want to create a nice class wrapping this\n#    (as you will want to have this map and its inversion)  \ngroup_map = dict(\n    A = dict(fields = ['field_1','field_2',.....], dc = ['field_1',....,'field_5']),\n    B = dict(fields = ['field_10',......        ], dc = ['field_10']),\n    .....\n    REPORTING_ONLY = dict(fields = ['field_1000','field_1001',...], dc = []),\n\n)\n\ngroup_map_inverted = dict()\nfor g, v in group_map.items():\n    group_map_inverted.update(dict([ (f,g) for f in v['fields'] ]))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Reading in the files and creating the storage (essentially doing what <code>append_to_multiple</code> does):</p>\n\n<pre><code>for f in files:\n   # read in the file, additional options hmay be necessary here\n   # the chunksize is not strictly necessary, you may be able to slurp each \n   # file into memory in which case just eliminate this part of the loop \n   # (you can also change chunksize if necessary)\n   for chunk in pd.read_table(f, chunksize=50000):\n       # we are going to append to each table by group\n       # we are not going to create indexes at this time\n       # but we *ARE* going to create (some) data_columns\n\n       # figure out the field groupings\n       for g, v in group_map.items():\n             # create the frame for this group\n             frame = chunk.reindex(columns = v['fields'], copy = False)    \n\n             # append it\n             store.append(g, frame, index=False, data_columns = v['dc'])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you have all of the tables in the file (actually you could store them in separate files if you wish, you would prob have to add the filename to the group_map, but probably this isn't necessary).</p>\n\n<p>This is how you get columns and create new ones:</p>\n\n<pre><code>frame = store.select(group_that_I_want)\n# you can optionally specify:\n# columns = a list of the columns IN THAT GROUP (if you wanted to\n#     select only say 3 out of the 20 columns in this sub-table)\n# and a where clause if you want a subset of the rows\n\n# do calculations on this frame\nnew_frame = cool_function_on_frame(frame)\n\n# to 'add columns', create a new group (you probably want to\n# limit the columns in this new_group to be only NEW ones\n# (e.g. so you don't overlap from the other tables)\n# add this info to the group_map\nstore.append(new_group, new_frame.reindex(columns = new_columns_created, copy = False), data_columns = new_columns_created)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When you are ready for post_processing:</p>\n\n<pre><code># This may be a bit tricky; and depends what you are actually doing.\n# I may need to modify this function to be a bit more general:\nreport_data = store.select_as_multiple([groups_1,groups_2,.....], where =['field_1&gt;0', 'field_1000=foo'], selector = group_1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>About data_columns, you don't actually need to define <strong>ANY</strong> data_columns; they allow you to sub-select rows based on the column. E.g. something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>store.select(group, where = ['field_1000=foo', 'field_1001&gt;0'])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>They may be most interesting to you in the final report generation stage (essentially a data column is segregated from other columns, which might impact efficiency somewhat if you define a lot).</p>\n\n<p>You also might want to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>create a function which takes a list of fields, looks up the groups in the groups_map, then selects these and concatenates the results so you get the resulting frame (this is essentially what select_as_multiple does). <em>This way the structure would be pretty transparent to you.</em></li>\n<li>indexes on certain data columns (makes row-subsetting much faster).</li>\n<li>enable compression.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let me know when you have questions!</p>\n", "title": "&quot;Large data&quot; work flows using pandas", "tags": ["python", "mongodb", "pandas", "large-data", "hdf5"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14262433/large-data-work-flows-using-pandas/14268804#14268804", "question_id": 14262433, "answer_id": 14268804}, {"body": "<p>This is the case for pymongo.

For more discussion of this topic, see the blog post</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>from <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html\">Android developers guide</a>:</p>\n\n<p>IntentService is a base class for Services that handle asynchronous requests (expressed as Intents) on demand. Clients send requests through startService(Intent) calls; the service is started as needed, handles each Intent in turn using a worker thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Design pattern used in IntentService</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>:\nThis \"work queue processor\" pattern is commonly used to offload tasks from an application's main thread. The IntentService class exists to simplify this pattern and take care of the mechanics. To use it, extend IntentService and implement onHandleIntent(Intent). IntentService will receive the Intents, launch a worker thread, and stop the service as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>All requests are handled on a single worker thread -- they may take as long as necessary (and will not block the application's main loop), but only one request will be processed at a time.</p>\n\n<p>The IntentService class provides a straightforward structure for running an operation on a single background thread. This allows it to handle long-running operations without affecting your user interface's responsiveness. Also, an IntentService isn't affected by most user interface lifecycle events, so it continues to run in circumstances that would shut down an AsyncTask.</p>\n\n<p>An IntentService has a few limitations:</p>\n\n<p>It can't interact directly with your user interface. To put its results in the UI, you have to send them to an Activity.\nWork requests run sequentially. If an operation is running in an IntentService, and you send it another request, the request waits until the first operation is finished.\nAn operation running on an IntentService can't be interrupted.\nHowever, in most cases</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IntentService is the preferred way to simple background operations</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Volley Library</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is library called <a href=\"http://java.dzone.com/articles/android-%E2%80%93-volley-library\">volley-library for developing android networking applications</a>\nSource code is available for public in github.</p>\n\n<p>The android official documentation for  <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/best-background.html\">Best practices for Background jobs</a>:\nhelps better understand on intent service, thread, handler, service. and also <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/index.html\">Performing Network Operations</a></p>\n", "title": "Service vs IntentService", "tags": ["android", "multithreading", "android-service", "android-intentservice"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15524280/service-vs-intentservice/20882900#20882900", "question_id": 15524280, "answer_id": 20882900}, {"body": "<p>main difference :</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Service class needs a manual stop using stopSelf().

This compile function is called just once for each references to the given directive. For example, say you are using the ng-repeat directive. ng-repeat will have to look up the element it is attached to, extract the html fragment that it is attached to and create a template function. </p>\n\n<p>If you have used HandleBars, underscore templates or equivalent, its like compiling their templates to extract out a template function. To this template function you pass data and the return value of that function is the html with the data in the right places. </p>\n\n<p>The compilation phase is that step in Angular which returns the template function. This template function in angular is called the linking function. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Linking phase :</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The linking phase is where you attach the data ( $scope ) to the linking function and it should return you the linked html. Since the directive also specifies where this html goes or what it changes, it is already good to go. This is the function where you want to make changes to the linked html, i.e the html that already has the data attached to it. In angular if you write code in the linking function its generally the post-link function (by default). It is kind of a callback that gets called after the linking function has linked the data with the template.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Controller :</strong></p>\n\n<p>The controller is a place where you put in some directive specific logic. This logic can go into the linking function as well, but then you would have to put that logic on the scope to make it \"shareable\". The problem with that is that you would then be corrupting the scope with your directives stuff which is not really something that is expected.\nSo what is the alternative if two Directives want to talk to each other / co-operate with each other? Ofcourse you could put all that logic into a service and then make both these directives depend on that service but that just brings in one more dependency. The alternative is to provide a Controller for this scope ( usually isolate scope ? ) and then this controller is injected into another directive when that directive \"requires\" the other one.

The only downside it everywhere I call MyService I will have to know that doStuff() returns a promise and all the code will have to us <code>then</code> to interact with the promise. I would rather just wait until myData is back before loading the my application.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Manual Bootstrap</strong> </p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.element(document).ready(function() {\n    $.getJSON(\"data.json\", function (data) {\n       // can't initialize the data here because the service doesn't exist yet\n       angular.bootstrap(document);\n       // too late to initialize here because something may have already\n       // tried to call doStuff() and would have got a null pointer exception\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Global Javascript Var</strong>\nI could send my JSON directly to a global Javascript variable:</p>\n\n<p>HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"data.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>data.js:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var dataForMyService = { \n// myData here\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then it would be available when initializing <code>MyService</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myModule.service('MyService', function() {\n    var myData = dataForMyService;\n    return {\n        doStuff: function () {\n            return myData.getSomeData();\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This would work too, but then I have a global javascript variable which smells bad.</p>\n\n<p>Are these my only options? Are one of these options better than the others? I know this is a pretty long question, but I wanted to show that I have tried to explore all my options.

What if you have controllers (for top-level nav, let's say) that exist outside of ng-view and which need to be initialized with data before the routing even begins to happen? How do we avoid mucking around on the server-side just to make that work?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use manual bootstrap and an angular constant</strong>. A naiive XHR gets you your data, and you bootstrap angular in its callback, which deals with your async issues. In the example below, you don't even need to create a global variable. The returned data exists only in angular scope as an injectable, and isn't even present inside of controllers, services, etc. unless you inject it. (Much as you would inject the output of your <code>resolve</code> object into the controller for a routed view.) If you prefer to thereafter interact with that data as a service, you can create a service, inject the data, and nobody will ever be the wiser.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//First, we have to create the angular module, because all the other JS files are going to load while we're getting data and bootstrapping, and they need to be able to attach to it.\nvar MyApp = angular.module('MyApp', ['dependency1', 'dependency2']);\n\n// Use angular's version of document.ready() just to make extra-sure DOM is fully \n// loaded before you bootstrap. This is probably optional, given that the async \n// data call will probably take significantly longer than DOM load. YMMV.\n// Has the added virtue of keeping your XHR junk out of global scope. \nangular.element(document).ready(function() {\n\n    //first, we create the callback that will fire after the data is down\n    function xhrCallback() {\n        var myData = this.responseText; // the XHR output\n\n        // here's where we attach a constant containing the API data to our app \n        // module. Don't forget to parse JSON, which `$http` normally does for you.\n        MyApp.constant('NavData', JSON.parse(myData));\n\n        // now, perform any other final configuration of your angular module.\n        MyApp.config(['$routeProvider', function ($routeProvider) {\n            $routeProvider\n              .when('/someroute', {configs})\n              .otherwise({redirectTo: '/someroute'});\n          }]);\n\n        // And last, bootstrap the app. Be sure to remove `ng-app` from your index.html.\n        angular.bootstrap(document, ['NYSP']);\n    };\n\n    //here, the basic mechanics of the XHR, which you can customize.\n    var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    oReq.onload = xhrCallback;\n    oReq.open(\"get\", \"/api/overview\", true); // your specific API URL\n    oReq.send();\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, your <code>NavData</code> constant exists. Go ahead and inject it into a controller or service: </p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('MyApp')\n    .controller('NavCtrl', ['NavData', function (NavData) {\n        $scope.localObject = NavData; //now it's addressable in your templates \n}]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course, using a bare XHR object strips away a number of the niceties that <code>$http</code> or JQuery would take care of for you, but this example works with no special dependencies, at least for a simple <code>get</code>. If you want a little more power for your request, load up an external library to help you out. But I don't think it's possible to access angular's <code>$http</code> or other tools in this context. </p>\n\n<p>(SO <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16537783/which-method-should-i-use-to-manually-bootstrap-my-angularjs\">related post</a>)</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS : Initialize service with asynchronous data", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "asynchronous", "service", "angular-promise"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16286605/angularjs-initialize-service-with-asynchronous-data/18336414#18336414", "question_id": 16286605, "answer_id": 18336414}, {"body": "<p>I used a similar approach to the one described by @XMLilley but wanted to have the ability to use AngularJS services like <code>$http</code> to load the configuration and do further initialization without the use of low level APIs or jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>Using <code>resolve</code> on routes was also not an option because I needed the values to be available as constants when my app is started, even in <code>module.config()</code> blocks.</p>\n\n<p>I created a small AngularJS app that loads the config, sets them as constants on the actual app and bootstraps it.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// define the module of your app\nangular.module('MyApp', []);\n\n// define the module of the bootstrap app\nvar bootstrapModule = angular.module('bootstrapModule', []);\n\n// the bootstrapper service loads the config and bootstraps the specified app\nbootstrapModule.factory('bootstrapper', function ($http, $log, $q) {\n  return {\n    bootstrap: function (appName) {\n      var deferred = $q.defer();\n\n      $http.get('/some/url')\n        .success(function (config) {\n          // set all returned values as constants on the app...\n          var myApp = angular.module(appName);\n          angular.forEach(config, function(value, key){\n            myApp.constant(key, value);\n          });\n          // ...and bootstrap the actual app.\n          angular.bootstrap(document, [appName]);\n          deferred.resolve();\n        })\n        .error(function () {\n          $log.warn('Could not initialize application, configuration could not be loaded.');\n          deferred.reject();\n        });\n\n      return deferred.promise;\n    }\n  };\n});\n\n// create a div which is used as the root of the bootstrap app\nvar appContainer = document.createElement('div');\n\n// in run() function you can now use the bootstrapper service and shutdown the bootstrapping app after initialization of your actual app\nbootstrapModule.run(function (bootstrapper) {\n\n  bootstrapper.bootstrap('MyApp').then(function () {\n    // removing the container will destroy the bootstrap app\n    appContainer.remove();\n  });\n\n});\n\n// make sure the DOM is fully loaded before bootstrapping.\nangular.element(document).ready(function() {\n  angular.bootstrap(appContainer, ['bootstrapModule']);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See it in action (using <code>$timeout</code> instead of <code>$http</code>) here: <a href=\"http://plnkr.co/edit/FYznxP3xe8dxzwxs37hi?p=preview\">http://plnkr.co/edit/FYznxP3xe8dxzwxs37hi?p=preview</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would recommend to use the approach described below by Martin Atkins and JBCP.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because I needed it in multiple projects, I just released a bower module that takes care of this: <a href=\"https://github.com/philippd/angular-deferred-bootstrap\">https://github.com/philippd/angular-deferred-bootstrap</a></p>\n\n<p>Example that loads data from the back-end and sets a constant called APP_CONFIG on the AngularJS module:</p>\n\n<pre><code>deferredBootstrapper.bootstrap({\n  element: document.body,\n  module: 'MyApp',\n  resolve: {\n    APP_CONFIG: function ($http) {\n      return $http.get('/api/demo-config');\n    }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "AngularJS : Initialize service with asynchronous data", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "asynchronous", "service", "angular-promise"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16286605/angularjs-initialize-service-with-asynchronous-data/19871327#19871327", "question_id": 16286605, "answer_id": 19871327}, {"body": "<p>The \"manual bootstrap\" case can gain access to Angular services by manually creating an injector before bootstrap.

Now to see any variation at all one has to be assuming that the container in some way is flexible in size. Whether through a direct percentage <code>width</code> or through being 100% minus margins. The point becomes \"moot\" if the container is always set to, let's say, <code>200px</code> wide--then just set a <code>font-size</code> that works for that width.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>With a flexible width container, however, it must be realized that in some way the container is <strong><em>still being sized off the view port</em></strong>. As such, it is a matter of adjusting a <code>vw</code> setting based off that percentage size difference to the view port, which means taking into account the sizing of parent wrappers. <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/T84wL/1/\"><strong>Take this example</strong></a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>div {\n    width: 50%;\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    margin: 20px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    /* 100 = view port width, as 1vw = 1/100th of that\n       So if the container is 50% of view port (as here)\n       then factor that into how you want it to size.\n       Let's say you like 5vw if it were the whole width,\n       then for this container, size it at 2.5vw (5 * .5 [i.e. 50%])\n    */\n    font-size: 2.5vw; \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming here the <code>div</code> is a child of the <code>body</code>, it is <code>50%</code> of that <code>100%</code> width, which is the viewport size in this basic case. Basically, you want to set a <code>vw</code> that is going to look good to you. As you can see in my comment in the above css, you can \"think\" through that mathematically with respect to the full viewport size, but you don't <em>need</em> to do that. The text is going to \"flex\" with the container, because the container is flexing with the viewport resizing. UPDATE: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/T84wL/6/\">here's an example of two differently sized containers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can help insure viewport sizing by forcing the calculation based off that. <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/T84wL/3/\"><strong>Consider this example</strong></a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>html {width: 100%;} /* force html to be viewport width */\nbody {width: 150%; } /* overflow the body */\n\ndiv {\n    width: 50%;\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    margin: 20px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    /* 100 = view port width, as 1vw = 1/100th of that\n       Here, the body is 200% of viewport, but the container is 50% \n       of view port, so both parents factor  into how you want it to size.\n       Let's say you like 5vw if it were the whole width,\n       then for this container, size it at 3.75vw \n       (5 * 1.5 [i.e. 150%]) * .5 [i.e. 50%]\n    */\n    font-size: 3.75vw; \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The sizing is still based off viewport, but is in essence set up based off the container size itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Should Sizing of the Container Change Dynamically...</h2>\n\n<p>If sizing of the container element ended up changing dynamically its percentage relationship either via <code>@media</code> break points or via javascript, then whatever the base \"target\" was would need recalculation to maintain the same \"relationship\" for text sizing.</p>\n\n<p>Take Example #1 above. If the <code>div</code> was switched to <code>25%</code> width by either <code>@media</code> or javascript, then at the same time, the <code>font-size</code> would need to adjust in either the media query or by javascript to the new calculation of <code>5vw * .25 = 1.25</code>. This would put the text size at the same size it would have been had the \"width\" of the original <code>50%</code> container been reduced by half from viewport sizing, but has now been reduced due to a change in its own percentage calculation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc\">the CSS3 <code>calc()</code> function</a> in use, it would become difficult to adjust dynamically, as that function does not work for <code>font-size</code> purposes at this time. So you could not do a pure CSS3 adjustment if your width is changing on <code>calc()</code>. Of course, a minor adjustment of width for margins may not be enough to warrant any change in <code>font-size</code>, so it may not matter.</p>\n", "title": "Font scaling based on width of container", "tags": ["css", "responsive-design", "font-size"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056591/font-scaling-based-on-width-of-container/19818026#19818026", "question_id": 16056591, "answer_id": 19818026}, {"body": "<p>Have you tried <a href=\"http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/</a> ?</p>\n\n<p>This is what I use for my sites and has worked perfectly.

This answer is not spoon-feedingly easy and needs some researching in developer end.</p>\n\n<p>I came finally to get a pure-CSS solution for this using <code>calc()</code> with different units. You will need some basic mathematical understanding of formulas to work out your expression for <code>calc()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>When I worked this out, I had to get a full-page-width responsive header with some padding few parents up in DOM. I'll use my values here, replace them with your own.</p>\n\n<h2>To mathematics</h2>\n\n<p>You will need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>nicely adjusted ratio in some viewport, I used 320px, thus I got 24px high and 224px wide so ratio is 9.333... or 28 / 3</li>\n<li>the container width, I had <code>padding: 3em</code> and full width so this got to <code>100wv - 2 * 3em</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>X is the width of container so replace it with your own expression or adjust the value to get full-page text. R is the ratio you will have. You can get it by adjusting the values in some viewport, inspecting element width and height and replacing them with your own values. Also, it is <code>width / heigth</code> ;) </p>\n\n<pre><code>x = 100vw - 2 * 3em = 100vw - 6em\nr = 224px/24px = 9.333... = 28 / 3\n\ny = x / r\n  = (100vw - 6em) / (28 / 3)\n  = (100vw - 6em) * 3 / 28\n  = (300vw - 18em) / 28\n  = (75vw - 4.5rem) / 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And bang! It worked! I wrote font-size: <code>calc((75vw - 4.5rem) / 7)</code> to my header and it adjusted nicely in every viewport.</p>\n\n<h2>But how does it work?</h2>\n\n<p>We need some constants up here. <code>100vw</code> means the full width of viewport, and my goal was to establish full-width header with some padding.</p>\n\n<p>The ratio. Getting a width and height in one viewport got me a ratio to play with, and with ratio I know what the height should be in other viewport width. Calculating them with hand would take plenty of time and at least take lots of bandwith so it's not a good answer.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>I wonder why no-one has figured this out and some people are even telling that this would be impossible to tinker with CSS. I don't like to use Javascript in adjusting elements, so I don't accept JS or even jQuery answers without digging more. All in all, it's good that this got figured out and this is one step to pure-CSS implementations in website design. </p>\n\n<p>I apologize of any unusual convention in my text, I'm not native speaker in english and also quite new to writing SO answers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: it should also be noted that we have evil scrollbars in some browsers. For example, when using Firefox I noticed that <code>100vw</code> means the full width of viewport, extending under scrollbar (where content cannot expand!), so the fullwidth text has to be margined carefully and preferably get tested with many browsers and devices.</p>\n", "title": "Font scaling based on width of container", "tags": ["css", "responsive-design", "font-size"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056591/font-scaling-based-on-width-of-container/39269074#39269074", "question_id": 16056591, "answer_id": 39269074}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056591/font-scaling-based-on-width-of-container", "question_id": 16056591}, {"body": "<p>I recently downloaded <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode\">Xcode</a> 5 DP to test my apps in iOS 7.

In addition, <code>pull</code> makes it easy to not think about how your changes might be affected by incoming changes.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>git pull</code> command is safe so long as it only performs fast-forward merges.  If <code>git pull</code> is configured to only do fast-forward merges and a fast-forward merge isn't possible, then Git will exit with an error.  This will give you an opportunity to study the incoming commits, think about how they might affect your local commits, and decide the best course of action (merge, rebase, reset, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>With Git 2.0 and newer, you can run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global pull.ff only\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to alter the default behavior to only fast-forward.  With Git versions between 1.6.6 and 1.9.x you'll have to get into the habit of typing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git pull --ff-only\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, with all versions of Git, I recommend configuring a <code>git up</code> alias like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and using <code>git up</code> instead of <code>git pull</code>.

Several recent changes to Git have made it easier to use <code>git pull</code> properly, but unfortunately the default behavior of a plain <code>git pull</code> has several problems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>it introduces unnecessary nonlinearities in the history</li>\n<li>it makes it easy to accidentally reintroduce commits that were intentionally rebased out upstream</li>\n<li>it modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways</li>\n<li>pausing what you are doing to review someone else's work is annoying with <code>git pull</code></li>\n<li>it makes it hard to correctly rebase onto the remote branch</li>\n<li>it doesn't clean up branches that were deleted in the remote repo</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These problems are described in greater detail below.</p>\n\n<h3>Nonlinear History</h3>\n\n<p>By default, the <code>git pull</code> command is equivalent to running <code>git fetch</code> followed by <code>git merge @{u}</code>. If there are unpushed commits in the local repository, the merge part of <code>git pull</code> creates a merge commit.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing inherently bad about merge commits, but they can be dangerous and should be treated with respect:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Merge commits are inherently difficult to examine.  To understand what a merge is doing, you have to understand the differences to all parents.  A conventional diff doesn't convey this multi-dimensional information well.  In contrast, a series of normal commits is easy to review.</li>\n<li>Merge conflict resolution is tricky, and mistakes often go undetected for a long time because merge commits are difficult to review.</li>\n<li>Merges can quietly supersede the effects of regular commits.  The code is no longer the sum of incremental commits, leading to misunderstandings about what actually changed.</li>\n<li>Merge commits may disrupt some continuous integration schemes (e.g., auto-build only the first-parent path under the assumed convention that second parents point to incomplete works in progress).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course there is a time and a place for merges, but understanding when merges should and should not be used can improve the usefulness of your repository.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the purpose of Git is to make it easy to share and consume the evolution of a codebase, not to precisely record history exactly as it unfolded.  (If you disagree, consider the <code>rebase</code> command and why it was created.)  The merge commits created by <code>git pull</code> do not convey useful semantics to others\u2014they just say that someone else happened to push to the repository before you were done with your changes.  Why have those merge commits if they aren't meaningful to others and could be dangerous?</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to configure <code>git pull</code> to rebase instead of merge, but this also has problems (discussed later).  Instead, <code>git pull</code> should be configured to only do fast-forward merges.</p>\n\n<h3>Reintroduction of Rebased-out Commits</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose someone rebases a branch and force pushes it.  This generally shouldn't happen, but it's sometimes necessary (e.g., to remove a 50GiB log file that was accidentally comitted and pushed).  The merge done by <code>git pull</code> will merge the new version of the upstream branch into the old version that still exists in your local repository.  If you push the result, pitch forks and torches will start coming your way.</p>\n\n<p>Some may argue that the real problem is force updates.  Yes, it's generally advisable to avoid force pushes whenever possible, but they are sometimes unavoidable.  Developers must be prepared to deal with force updates, because they will happen sometimes.  This means not blindly merging in the old commits via an ordinary <code>git pull</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Surprise Working Directory Modifications</h3>\n\n<p>There's no way to predict what the working directory or index will look like until <code>git pull</code> is done.  There might be merge conflicts that you have to resolve before you can do anything else, it might introduce a 50GiB log file in your working directory because someone accidentally pushed it, it might rename a directory you are working in, etc.</p>\n\n<p><code>git remote update -p</code> (or <code>git fetch --all -p</code>) allows you to look at other people's commits before you decide to merge or rebase, allowing you to form a plan before taking action.</p>\n\n<h3>Difficulty Reviewing Other People's Commits</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose you are in the middle of making some changes and someone else wants you to review some commits they just pushed.  <code>git pull</code>'s merge (or rebase) operation modifies the working directory and index, which means your working directory and index must be clean.</p>\n\n<p>You could use <code>git stash</code> and then <code>git pull</code>, but what do you do when you're done reviewing?  To get back to where you were you have to undo the merge created by <code>git pull</code> and apply the stash.</p>\n\n<p><code>git remote update -p</code> (or <code>git fetch --all -p</code>) doesn't modify the working directory or index, so it's safe to run at any time&mdash;even if you have staged and/or unstaged changes.  You can pause what you're doing and review someone else's commit without worrying about stashing or finishing up the commit you're working on. <code>git pull</code> doesn't give you that flexibility.</p>\n\n<h3>Rebasing onto a Remote Branch</h3>\n\n<p>A common Git usage pattern is to do a <code>git pull</code> to bring in the latest changes followed by a <code>git rebase @{u}</code> to eliminate the merge commit that <code>git pull</code> introduced.  It's common enough that Git has some configuration options to reduce these two steps to a single step by telling <code>git pull</code> to perform a rebase instead of a merge (see the <code>branch.&lt;branch&gt;.rebase</code>, <code>branch.autosetuprebase</code>, and <code>pull.rebase</code> options).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if you have an unpushed merge commit that you want to preserve (e.g., a commit merging a pushed feature branch into <code>master</code>), neither a rebase-pull (<code>git pull</code> with <code>branch.&lt;branch&gt;.rebase</code> set to <code>true</code>) nor a merge-pull (the default <code>git pull</code> behavior) followed by a rebase will work.  This is because <code>git rebase</code> eliminates merges (it linearizes the DAG) without the <code>--preserve-merges</code> option.  The rebase-pull operation can't be configured to preserve merges, and a merge-pull followed by a <code>git rebase -p @{u}</code> won't eliminate the merge caused by the merge-pull.  <strong>Update:</strong>  Git v1.8.5 added <code>git pull --rebase=preserve</code> and <code>git config pull.rebase preserve</code>.  These cause <code>git pull</code> to do <code>git rebase --preserve-merges</code> after fetching the upstream commits.  (Thanks to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/985627/funkaster\">funkaster</a> for the heads-up!)</p>\n\n<h3>Cleaning Up Deleted Branches</h3>\n\n<p><code>git pull</code> doesn't prune remote tracking branches corresponding to branches that were deleted from the remote repository.  For example, if someone deletes branch <code>foo</code> from the remote repo, you'll still see <code>origin/foo</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to users accidentally resurrecting killed branches because they think they're still active.</p>\n\n<h2>A Better Alternative:  Use <code>git up</code> instead of <code>git pull</code></h2>\n\n<p>Instead of <code>git pull</code>, I recommend creating and using the following <code>git up</code> alias:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This alias downloads all of the latest commits from all upstream branches (pruning the dead branches) and tries to fast-forward the local branch to the latest commit on the upstream branch.  If successful, then there were no local commits, so there was no risk of merge conflict.  The fast-forward will fail if there are local (unpushed) commits, giving you an opportunity to review the upstream commits before taking action.</p>\n\n<p>This still modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways, but only if you don't have any local changes.  Unlike <code>git pull</code>, <code>git up</code> will never drop you to a prompt expecting you to fix a merge conflict.</p>\n\n<h3>Another Option: <code>git pull --ff-only --all -p</code></h3>\n\n<p>The following is an alternative to the above <code>git up</code> alias:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global alias.up 'pull --ff-only --all -p'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This version of <code>git up</code> has the same behavior as the previous <code>git up</code> alias, except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the error message is a bit more cryptic if your local branch isn't configured with an upstream branch</li>\n<li>it relies on an undocumented feature (the <code>-p</code> argument, which is passed to <code>fetch</code>) that may change in future versions of Git</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>If you are running Git 2.0 or newer</h3>\n\n<p>With Git 2.0 and newer you can configure <code>git pull</code> to only do fast-forward merges by default:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global pull.ff only\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This causes <code>git pull</code> to act like <code>git pull --ff-only</code>, but it still doesn't fetch all upstream commits or clean out old <code>origin/*</code> branches so I still prefer <code>git up</code>.</p>\n", "title": "In what cases could `git pull` be harmful?", "tags": ["git", "git-pull"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15316601/in-what-cases-could-git-pull-be-harmful/15316602#15316602", "question_id": 15316601, "answer_id": 15316602}, {"body": "<p>My answer, pulled from the discussion that <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7385087\">arose</a> on HackerNews:</p>\n\n<p>I feel tempted to just answer the question using the Betteridge Law of Headlines: Why is <code>git pull</code> considered harmful?

Do they mean the same across all major operating systems?", "tags": ["linux", "windows", "sockets", "unix", "portability"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of portability... or rather the lack of it. Before we start analyzing these two options in detail and take a deeper look how different operating systems handle them, it should be noted that the BSD socket implementation is the mother of all socket implementations. Basically all other systems copied the BSD socket implementation at some point of time (or at least its interfaces) and then started to evolving it on their own. Of course the BSD socket implementation was evolved as well at the same time and thus systems that copied it later got features that were lacking in systems that copied it earlier. Understanding the BSD socket implementation is the key to understanding all other socket implementations, so you should read about it even if you don't care to ever write code for a BSD system.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of basics you should know before we look at these two options. A TCP/UDP connection is identified by a tuple of five values:</p>\n\n<p><code>{&lt;protocol&gt;, &lt;src addr&gt;, &lt;src port&gt;, &lt;dest addr&gt;, &lt;dest port&gt;}</code></p>\n\n<p>Any unique combination of these values identifies a connection. As a result, no two connections can have the same five values, otherwise the system would not be able to distinguish these connections any longer.</p>\n\n<p>The protocol of a socket is set when a socket is created with the <code>socket()</code> function. The source address and port are set with the <code>bind()</code> function. The destination address and port are set with the <code>connect()</code> function. Since UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP sockets can be used without connecting them. Yet it is allowed to connect them and in some cases very advantageous for your code and general application design. In connectionless mode, UDP sockets that were not explicitly bound when data is sent over them for the first time are usually automatically bound by the system, as an unbound UDP socket cannot receive any (reply) data. Same is true for an unbound TCP socket, it is automatically bound before it will be connected.</p>\n\n<p>If you explicitly bind a socket, it is possible to bind it to port <code>0</code>, which means \"any port\". Since a socket cannot really be bound to all existing ports, the system will have to choose a specific port itself in that case (usually from a predefined, OS specific range of source ports). A similar wildcard exists for the source address, which can be \"any address\" (<code>0.0.0.0</code> in case of IPv4 and <code>::</code> in case of IPv6). Unlike in case of ports, a socket can really be bound to \"any address\" which means \"all source IP addresses of all local interfaces\". If the socket is connected later on, the system has to choose a specific source IP address, since a socket cannot be connected and at the same time be bound to any local IP address. Depending on the destination address and the content of the routing table, the system will pick an appropriate source address and replace the \"any\" binding with a binding to the chosen source IP address.</p>\n\n<p>By default, no two sockets can be bound to the same combination of source address and source port. As long as the source port is different, the source address is actually irrelevant. Binding <code>socketA</code> to <code>A:X</code> and <code>socketB</code> to <code>B:Y</code>, where <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are addresses and <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are ports, is always possible as long as <code>X != Y</code> holds true. However, even if <code>X == Y</code>, the binding is still possible as long as <code>A != B</code> holds true. E.g. <code>socketA</code> belongs to a FTP server program and is bound to <code>192.168.0.1:21</code> and <code>socketB</code> belongs to another FTP server program and is bound to <code>10.0.0.1:21</code>, both bindings will succeed. Keep in mind, though, that a socket may be locally bound to \"any address\". If a socket is bound to <code>0.0.0.0:21</code>, it is bound to all existing local addresses at the same time and in that case no other socket can be bound to port <code>21</code>, regardless which specific IP address it tries to bind to, as <code>0.0.0.0</code> conflicts with all existing local IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>Anything said so far is pretty much equal for all major operating system. Things start to get OS specific when address reuse comes into play. We start with BSD, since as I said above, it is the mother of all socket implementations.</p>\n\n<h1>BSD</h1>\n\n<h2>SO_REUSEADDR</h2>\n\n<p>If <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is enabled on a socket prior to binding it, the socket can be successfully bound unless there is a conflict with another socket bound to <strong>exactly</strong> the same combination of source address and port. Now you may wonder how is that any different than before? The keyword is \"exactly\". <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> mainly changes the way how wildcard addresses (\"any IP address\") are treated when searching for conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>Without <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, binding <code>socketA</code> to <code>0.0.0.0:21</code> and then binding <code>socketB</code> to <code>192.168.0.1:21</code> will fail (with error <code>EADDRINUSE</code>), since 0.0.0.0 means \"any local IP address\", thus all local IP addresses are considered in use by this socket and this includes <code>192.168.0.1</code>, too. With <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will succeed, since <code>0.0.0.0</code> and <code>192.168.0.1</code> are <strong>not exactly</strong> the same address, one is a wildcard for all local addresses and the other one is a very specific local address. Note that the statement above is true regardless in which order <code>socketA</code> and <code>socketB</code> are bound; without <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will always fail, with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will always succeed.</p>\n\n<p>To give you a better overview, let's make a table here and list all possible combinations:</p>\n\n<pre>\nSO_REUSEADDR       socketA        socketB       Result\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ON/OFF       192.168.0.1:21   192.168.0.1:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n  ON/OFF       192.168.0.1:21      10.0.0.1:21    OK\n  ON/OFF          10.0.0.1:21   192.168.0.1:21    OK\n   OFF             0.0.0.0:21   192.168.1.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n   OFF         192.168.1.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n   ON              0.0.0.0:21   192.168.1.0:21    OK\n   ON          192.168.1.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    OK\n  ON/OFF           0.0.0.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n</pre>\n\n<p>The table above assumes that <code>socketA</code> has already been successfully bound to the address given for <code>socketA</code>, then <code>socketB</code> is created, either gets <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set or not, and finally is bound to the address given for <code>socketB</code>. <code>Result</code> is the result of the bind operation for <code>socketB</code>. If the first column says <code>ON/OFF</code>, the value of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is irrelevant to the result.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> has an effect on wildcard addresses, good to know. Yet that isn't it's only effect it has. There is another well known effect which is also the reason why most people use <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> in server programs in the first place. For the other important use of this option we have to take a deeper look on how the TCP protocol works.</p>\n\n<p>A socket has a send buffer and if a call to the <code>send()</code> function succeeds, it does not mean that the requested data has actually really been sent out, it only means the data has been added to the send buffer. For UDP sockets, the data is usually sent pretty soon, if not immediately, but for TCP sockets, there can be a relatively long delay between adding data to the send buffer and having the TCP implementation really send that data. As a result, when you close a TCP socket, there may still be pending data in the send buffer, which has not been sent yet but your code considers it as sent, since the <code>send()</code> call succeeded. If the TCP implementation was closing the socket immediately on your request, all of this data would be lost and your code wouldn't even know about that. TCP is said to be a reliable protocol and losing data just like that is not very reliable. That's why a socket that still has data to send will go into a state called <code>TIME_WAIT</code> when you close it. In that state it will wait until all pending data has been successfully sent or until a timeout is hit, in which case the socket is closed forcefully.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of time the kernel will wait before it closes the socket, regardless if it still has pending send data or not, is called the <em>Linger Time</em>. The <em>Linger Time</em> is globally configurable on most systems and by default rather long (two minutes is a common value you will find on many systems). It is also configurable per socket using the socket option <code>SO_LINGER</code> which can be used to make the timeout shorter or longer, and even to disable it completely. Disabling it completely is a very bad idea, though, since closing a TCP socket gracefully is a slightly complex process and involves sending forth and back a couple of packets (as well as resending those packets in case they got lost) and this whole close process is also limited by the <em>Linger Time</em>. If you disable lingering, your socket may not only lose pending data, it is also always closed forcefully instead of gracefully, which is usually not recommended. The details about how a TCP connection is closed gracefully are beyond the scope of this answer, if you want to learn more about, I recommend you have a look at <a href=\"http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/Course/Section4/11.htm\">this page</a>. And even if you disabled lingering with <code>SO_LINGER</code>, if your process dies without explicitly closing the socket, BSD (and possibly other systems) will linger nonetheless, ignoring what you have configured. This will happen for example if your code just calls <code>exit()</code> (pretty common for tiny, simple server programs) or the process is killed by a signal (which includes the possibility that it simply crashes because of an illegal memory access). So there is nothing you can do to make sure a socket will never linger under all circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>The question is, how does the system treat a socket in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code>? If <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is not set, a socket in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code> is considered to still be bound to the source address and port and any attempt to bind a new socket to the same address and port will fail until the socket has really been closed, which may take as long as the configured <em>Linger Time</em>. So don't expect that you can rebind the source address of a socket immediately after closing it. In most cases this will fail. However, if <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is set for the socket you are trying to bind, another socket bound to the same address and port in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code> is simply ignored, after all its already \"half dead\", and your socket can bind to exactly the same address without any problem. In that case it plays no role that the other socket may have exactly the same address and port. Note that binding a socket to exactly the same address and port as a dying socket in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state can have unexpected, and usually undesired, side effects in case the other socket is still \"at work\", but that is beyond the scope of this answer and fortunately those side effects are rather rare in practice.</p>\n\n<p>There is one final thing you should know about <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>. Everything written above will work as long as the socket you want to bind to has address reuse enabled. It is not necessary that the other socket, the one which is already bound or is in a <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state, also had this flag set when it was bound. The code that decides if the bind will succeed or fail only inspects the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> flag of the socket fed into the <code>bind()</code> call, for all other sockets inspected, this flag is not even looked at.</p>\n\n<h2>SO_REUSEPORT</h2>\n\n<p><code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> is what most people would expect <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> to be. Basically, <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> allows you to bind an arbitrary number of sockets to <strong>exactly</strong> the same source address and port as long as <strong>all</strong> prior bound sockets also had <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set before they were bound. If the first socket that is bound to an address and port does not have <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set, no other socket can be bound to exactly the same address and port, regardless if this other socket has <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set or not, until the first socket releases its binding again. Unlike in case of <code>SO_REUESADDR</code> the code handling <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> will not only verify that the currently bound socket has <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set but it will also verify that the socket with a conflicting address and port had <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set when it was bound.</p>\n\n<p><code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> does not imply <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>. This means if a socket did not have <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set when it was bound and another socket has <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set when it is bound to exactly the same address and port, the bind fails, which is expected, but it also fails if the other socket is already dying and is in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state. To be able bind a socket to the same addresses and port as another socket in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state requires either <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> to be set on that socket or <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> must have been set <strong>on both</strong> sockets prior to binding them. Of course it is allowed to set both, <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> and <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, on a socket.</p>\n\n<p>There is not much more to say about <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> other than that it was added later than <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, that's why you will not find it in many socket implementations of other systems, which \"forked\" the BSD code before this option was added, and that there was no way to bind two sockets to exactly the same socket address in BSD prior to this option.</p>\n\n<h2>Connect() Returning EADDRINUSE?</h2>\n\n<p>Most people know that <code>bind()</code> may fail with the error <code>EADDRINUSE</code>, however, when you start playing around with address reuse, you may run into the strange situation that <code>connect()</code> fails with that error as well. How can this be? How can a remote address, after all that's what connect adds to a socket, be already in use? Connecting multiple sockets to exactly the same remote address has never been a problem before, so what's going wrong here?</p>\n\n<p>As I said on the very top of my reply, a connection is defined by a tuple of five values, remember? And I also said, that these five values must be unique otherwise the system cannot distinguish two connections any longer, right? Well, with address reuse, you can bind two sockets of the same protocol to the same source address and port. That means three of those five values are already the same for these two sockets. If you now try to connect both of these sockets also to the same destination address and port, you would create two connected sockets, whose tuples are absolutely identical. This cannot work, at least not for TCP connections (UDP connections are no real connections anyway). If data arrived for either one of the two connections, the system could not tell which connection the data belongs to. At least the destination address or destination port must be different for either connection, so that the system has no problem to identify to which connection incoming data belongs to.</p>\n\n<p>So if you bind two sockets of the same protocol to the same source address and port and try to connect them both to the same destination address and port, <code>connect()</code> will actually fail with the error <code>EADDRINUSE</code> for the second socket you try to connect, which means that a socket with an identical tuple of five values is already connected.</p>\n\n<h2>Multicast Addresses</h2>\n\n<p>Most people ignore the fact that multicast addresses exist, but they do exist. While unicast addresses are used for one-to-one communication, multicast addresses are used for one-to-many communication. Most people got aware of multicast addresses when they learned about IPv6 but multicast addresses also existed in IPv4, even though this feature was never widely used on the public Internet.</p>\n\n<p>The meaning of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> changes for multicast addresses as it allows multiple sockets to be bound to exactly the same combination of source multicast address and port. In other words, for multicast addresses <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> behaves exactly as <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> for unicast addresses. Actually the code treats <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> and <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> identically for multicast addresses, that means you could say that <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> implies <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> for all multicast addresses and the other way round.</p>\n\n<h1><br>FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD</h1>\n\n<p>All these are rather late forks of the original BSD code, that's why they all three offer the same options as BSD and they also behave the same way as in BSD.</p>\n\n<h1><br>MacOS X</h1>\n\n<p>At its very core, MacOS X is simply a BSD-style UNIX, based on a rather late fork of the BSD code, which was even synchronized with FreeBSD 5 for the Mac OS 10.3 release. That's why MacOS X offers the same options as BSD and they also behave the same way as in BSD.</p>\n\n<h1><br>iOS</h1>\n\n<p>iOS is just modified MacOS X at its core, so everything that applies to MacOS X also applies to iOS.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Linux</h1>\n\n<p>Prior to Linux 3.9, only the option <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> existed. This option behaves generally the same as in BSD with two important exceptions. One exception is that if a listening (server) TCP socket is already bound to a wildcard IP address and a specific port, no other TCP socket can be bound to the same port, regardless whether either one or both sockets have this flag set. Not even if it would use a more specific address (as is allowed in case of BSD). This restriction does not apply to non-listening (client) TCP sockets and it is also possible to first bind a listening TCP socket to a specific IP address and port combination and later on bind another one to a wildcard IP address and the same port. The second exception is that for UDP sockets this option behaves exactly like <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> in BSD, so two UDP sockets can be bound to exactly the same address and port combination as long as both had this flag set before they were bound.</p>\n\n<p>Linux 3.9 added the option <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> to Linux as well. This option allows two (or more) sockets, TCP or UDP, listening (server) or non-listening (client), to be bound to exactly the same address and port combination as long as all sockets (including the very first one) had this flag set prior to binding them. To prevent \"port hijacking\", there is one special limitation, though: All sockets that want to share the same address and port combination must belong to processes that share the same effective user ID! So one user cannot \"steal\" ports of another user. Additionally the kernel performs some \"special magic\" for <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> sockets that isn't found in any other operating system so far: For UDP sockets, it tries to distribute datagrams evenly, for TCP listening sockets, it tries to distribute incoming connect requests (those accepted by calling <code>accept()</code>)  evenly across all the sockets that share the same address and port combination. That means while it is more or less random which socket receives a datagram or connect request in other operating systems that allow full address reuse, Linux tries to optimize distribution so that, for example, multiple instances of a simple server process can easily use <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> sockets to achieve a kind of simple load balancing and that absolutely for free as the kernel is doing \"all the hard work\" for them.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Android</h1>\n\n<p>Even though the whole Android system is somewhat different from most Linux distributions, at its core works a slightly modified Linux kernel, thus everything that applies to Linux applies to Android as well.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Windows</h1>\n\n<p>Windows only knows the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> option, there is no <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>. Setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on a socket in Windows behaves like setting <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> and <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on a socket in BSD, with one exception: A socket with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> can always bind to exactly the same source address and port as an already bound socket, <strong>even if the other socket did not have this option set when it was bound</strong>. This behavior is somewhat dangerous because it allows an application \"to steal\" the connected port of another application. Needless to say, this can have major security implications. Microsoft realized that this might be a problem and thus added another socket option <code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code>. Setting <code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code> on a socket makes sure that if the binding succeeds, the combination of source address and port is owned exclusively by this socket and no other socket can bind to them, not even if it has <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Solaris</h1>\n\n<p>Solaris is the successor of SunOS. SunOS was originally based on a fork of BSD, SunOS 5 and later was based on a fork of SVR4, however SVR4 is a merge of BSD, System V, and Xenix, so up to some degree Solaris is also a BSD fork, and a rather early one. As a result Solaris only knows <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, there is no <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>. The <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> behaves pretty much the same as it does in BSD. As far as I know there is no way to get the same behavior as <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> in Solaris, that means it is not possible to bind two sockets to exactly the same address and port.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to Windows, Solaris has an option to give a socket an exclusive binding. This option is named <code>SO_EXCLBIND</code>. If this option is set on a socket prior to binding it, setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on another socket has no effect if the two sockets are tested for an address conflict. E.g. if <code>socketA</code> is bound to a wildcard address and <code>socketB</code> has <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> enabled and is bound to a non-wildcard address and the same port as <code>socketA</code>, this bind will normally succeed, unless <code>socketA</code> had <code>SO_EXCLBIND</code> enabled, in which case it will fail regardless the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> flag of <code>socketB</code>.</p>\n", "title": "Socket options SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT, how do they differ?

Volley is thread based and this is not the way background processing should take place on Android.

That is, the entire request body has to be in memory and you cannot use an <code>OutputStream</code> to write the request body to the underlying socket, nor can you use an <code>InputStream</code> to read the response body, as basic <code>HttpURLConnection</code> does. So, Volley is a poor choice for uploading or downloading large files. Your requests and responses should be small. This is one of the biggest limitations of Volley that I have personally encountered. For what it's worth, OkHttp does have interfaces for working with streams.</p></li>\n<li><p>The lack of official documentation is annoying, although I have been able to work around that by reading the source code, which is pretty easy to follow. What is more bothersome is that, as far as I can tell, Volley has no official release versions and no Maven or Gradle artifact, and therefore managing it as a dependency becomes more of a headache than, say, any of the libraries Square has released. You just clone a repo, build a jar, and you're on your own. Looking for a bug fix? Fetch and hope it's there. You might get some other stuff, too; it won't be documented. In my opinion, this effectively means that Volley is an unsupported 3rd party library, even though the code base is reasonably active. Caveat emptor.</p></li>\n<li><p>As a nit, having the Content-Type tied to the class/request type (JsonObjectRequest, ImageRequest, etc.) is kind of awkward and reduces the flexibility of the calling code a bit, as you are tied to Volley's existing Request type hierarchy. I like the straightforwardness of just setting Content-Type as a header like any other (don't do this with Volley, by the way; you'll end up with two Content-Type headers!).

Me too. And it\u2019s a pretty annoying.\nFortunately, there are a few ways that you can use to improve this. Android uses Gradle for building. The latest version is 2.10 has a huge performance boost over previous versions (see Release notes for details).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Update Gradle version\nAn easier way to accomplish this is to go to: Open Module Settings (your project) > Project Structure</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xFm0I.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xFm0I.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In Gradle version and enter 2.10</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0XyDw.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0XyDw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Download Gradle Release distributive from <a href=\"https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.10-all.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.10-all.zip</a>\nAnd copy it to the Gradle folder:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNm1e.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNm1e.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Last step is to add your discribution in Settings > Gradle</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jOrQL.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jOrQL.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to click Apply to save changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enable Offline mode, Gradle daemon and parallel build for the project\nOffline mode tells Gradle to ignore update-to-date checks. Gradle asks for dependencies everytime and having this option makes it just uses what is already on the machine for dependencies.\nGo to Gradle from android studio Setting and click in Offline work box.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HeBg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HeBg.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Go to Compiler from android studio Setting and add \u201c\u2014 offline\u201d in command-line box and click Compile independent modules in parallel.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9cgJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9cgJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The next step is to enable the Gradle daemon and parallel build for your project. Parallel builds will cause your projects with multiple modules (multi-project builds in Gradle) to be built in parallel, which should make large or modular projects build faster.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vhps7.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vhps7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>These settings could enabled by modifiing a file named gradle.properties in Gradle scripts directory(i.e., ~/.gradle/gradle.properties).Some of these options (e.g. Complie modules in parallel) are available from Android Studio and also enabled there by default, but putting them in the gradle.properties file will enabled them when building from the terminal and also making sure that your colleagues will use the same settings. But if you\u2019re working on a team, sometimes you can\u2019t commit this stuff.</p>\n\n<pre><code># When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.\n# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit org.gradle.parallel=true\n# When set to true the Gradle daemon is used to run the build. For local developer builds this is our favorite property.\n# The developer environment is optimized for speed and feedback so we nearly always run Gradle jobs with the daemon.\n org.gradle.daemon=true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the daemon will make your builds startup faster as it won\u2019t have to start up the entire Gradle application every time. The Gradle Daemon is not enabled by default, but it\u2019s recommend always enabling it for developers\u2019 machines (but leaving it disabled for continuous integration servers). FAQ about this mode could be found here <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html</a>.\nThe parallel builds setting could be unsafe for some projects. The requirement is that all your modules must be decoupled or your build could fail (see <a href=\"http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects</a> for details).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enable incremental dexign and tweak memory settings\nYou can speed up your builds by turning on incremental dexing. In your module\u2019s build file:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eWQwO.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eWQwO.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Add this option to your android block:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dexOptions {\n    incremental true\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In that dexOptions block you can also specify the heap size for the dex process, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dexOptions {\n    incremental true\n    javaMaxHeapSize \"12g\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where \u201c12g\u201d is 12GB of memory. Additional information about this could be found here google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/\nYou can also configure Gradle parameters in the settings file, e.g. increase the max heap size in case you have a large project:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.\n# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.\n# Default value: -Xmx10248m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\norg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See all list of parameters here: <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties</a> for details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Disable Antivirus\nConsider to exclude project and cache files from antivirus scanning. This is obviously a trade off with security. But if you switch between branches a lot, then antivirus will rescan files before allowing gradle process to use it, which slows build time (in particular Android Studio sync project with gradle files and indexing tasks). Measure build time and process CPU with and without antivirus enabled to see if it is related.\nI hope this helps.

It can be caused by a wide variety of issues that mostly all have to do with your project structure not matching what's expected. Here's a list of all the problems I've had:</p>\n\n<p>Importing from Eclipse to Android Studio does not always work smoothly, especially with older versions of Android Studio. Make sure you're using the correct directory tree. It should look like this for a moderately mature app:</p>\n\n<pre><code>AppName/        // AppName is your app's name, obviously\n    .gradle/    // This is a compiler created directory. You should normally leave it alone\n    .idea/      // Ditto\n    build/      // This too\n    gradle/     // And this\n    app/\n        build/\n        libs/\n        src/\n            androidTest/   // Tests based on the Android instrumentation runner should go here\n            main/\n                java/\n                    fully/           // Typically com\n                        qualified/   // the domain name. Longer package \n                                     // names may have deeper folder trees\n                            AppName/ // All your java files go here\n                res/\n                    drawable-*/      // One of these for each resolution you support\n                    layout/          // All of your general layouts\n                    menu/            // All of your menu layouts\n                    values/          // All of your resource xml files\n                    xml/             // PreferenceScreen layouts go here\n                AndroidManifest.xml\n            debug/         \n            test/          // Pure jUnit tests should go here\n        .gitignore\n        app.iml\n        build.gradle   // This is the gradle file you should be making most changes to\n        proguard-rules.pro\n    .gitignore\n    build.gradle       // This gradle file should mostly be left alone\n    gradle.properties\n    gradlew\n    local.properties\n    AppName.iml\n    settings.gradle\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It may not look like this in your IDE. There is a drop-down above the file tree that displays your files in different ways, and it defaults on my system to one called Android that breaks your files out into their different types. It's easier to fix this kind of problem from the one called Project, and even easier directly from your OS's file system, because Android Studio collapses folders that only contain another folder onto a single line.</p>\n\n<p>Especially if you ever change the name of your app, you need to make sure that the source tree main/java/com/domain/AppName is updated. Also make sure that the package tag in your AndroidManifest.xml is correct.</p>\n\n<p>If there are errors in either your Gradle files or your AndroidManifest.xml, this will prevent Android Studio from properly building your resource files. Gradle files can be broken by upgrading Android Studio sometimes, especially from the pre-1.0 versions. Sometimes this is because it stops supporting older versions of the Gradle plugin, so you need to update your version numbers. It can sometimes be hard to find what the current versions are. As of today, 7/17/15, my apps are compiling fine with <code>com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.2.3</code>. This is in the dependencies block in the outermost gradle file, </p>\n\n<p>If your AndroidManifest references a non-existent drawable or string resource or activity, it will break and cause this error. Sometimes if anything references a nonexistent drawable or string resource you will get this error.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a file in your resources that is corrupted, or an invalid xml file, you will get this error.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience, sometimes Android Studio just hiccups for no reason, and you need to restart it and/or your PC. I don't know why, but sometimes it works.</p>\n\n<p>If you have two xml resources with the same name, in directories that do not override each other, you can have this problem. For instance, you can have the same name in drawable-mhdpi and drawable-xhdpi because they override each other depending on the target device, but if you have the same name in layout and in menu, it will cause a problem. Rename or delete one of the files.</p>\n\n<p>If only some resources are having this problem, those resources are most likely in the wrong directory.</p>\n\n<p>In one case I had to completely reinstall Android Studio. I don't know what was wrong, but it worked.</p>\n\n<p>In one case I moved my entire project to a different directory and re-imported it as a new project. I don't know what was wrong, but it worked.</p>\n\n<p>Xml files with reserved words for names can cause this problem. Rename or delete them.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few ways your Gradle file can end up referencing a version of the build-tools that you do not have installed. Correct this by changing Gradle or downloading the appropriate build-tools.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, after you've fixed whatever is wrong, you need to clean your Gradle project. You do this by going to the Build menu at the top and selecting Clean Project.</p>\n", "title": "&quot;cannot resolve symbol R&quot; in Android Studio", "tags": ["android", "android-studio", "r.java-file"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17054000/cannot-resolve-symbol-r-in-android-studio/31486450#31486450", "question_id": 17054000, "answer_id": 31486450}, {"body": "<p>i did <code>make project</code> and it works\nbut before that try to check the package name in your manifest, rebuild and clean your project. if the problem didn't resolve, than make your project</p>\n", "title": "&quot;cannot resolve symbol R&quot; in Android Studio", "tags": ["android", "android-studio", "r.java-file"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17054000/cannot-resolve-symbol-r-in-android-studio/32119880#32119880", "question_id": 17054000, "answer_id": 32119880}, {"body": "<p>I had \nandroid:textAllCaps = \"false\"\n in the androidmanifest which was creating havoc to the R file.

A context-sensitive (Type-1) grammar allows multiple symbols of context on the left hand side of a production, but the same context must appear on the right hand side of the production (hence the name \"context-sensitive\"). [1] Context-sensitive grammars are equivalent to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_bounded_automaton\">linear-bounded Turing machines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the example program, the prime computation could be performed by a linear-bounded Turing machine, so it does not quite prove Turing equivalence, but the important part is that the parser needs to perform the computation in order to perform syntactic analysis. It could have been any computation expressible as a template instantiation and there is every reason to believe that C++ template instantiation is Turing-complete. See, for example, <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.14.3670\">Todd L. Veldhuizen's 2003 paper</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, C++ can be parsed by a computer, so it could certainly be parsed by a Turing machine. Consequently, an unrestricted grammar could recognize it. Actually writing such a grammar would be impractical, which is why the standard doesn't try to do so. (See below.)</p>\n\n<p>The issue with \"ambiguity\" of certain expressions is mostly a red herring. To start with, ambiguity is a feature of a particular grammar, not a language. Even if a language can be proven to have no unambiguous grammars, if it can be recognized by a context-free grammar, it's context-free. Similarly, if it cannot be recognized by a context-free grammar but it can be recognized by a context-sensitive grammar, it's context-sensitive. Ambiguity is not relevant.</p>\n\n<p>But in any event, like line 21 (i.e. <code>auto b = foo&lt;IsPrime&lt;234799&gt;&gt;::typen&lt;1&gt;();</code>) in the program below, the expressions are not ambiguous at all; they are simply parsed differently depending on context. In the simplest expression of the issue, the syntactic category of certain identifiers is dependent on how they have been declared (types and functions, for example), which means that the formal language would have to recognize the fact that two arbitrary-length strings in the same program are identical (declaration and use). This can be modelled by the \"copy\" grammar, which is the grammar which recognizes two consecutive exact copies of the same word. It's easy to prove with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma\">pumping lemma</a> that this language is not context-free. A context-sensitive grammar for this language is possible, and a Type-0 grammar is provided in the answer to this question: <a href=\"http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/163830/context-sensitive-grammar-for-the-copy-language\">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/163830/context-sensitive-grammar-for-the-copy-language</a> .</p>\n\n<p>If one were to attempt to write a context-sensitive (or unrestricted) grammar to parse C++, it would quite possibly fill the universe with scribblings. Writing a Turing machine to parse C++ would be an equally impossible undertaking. Even writing a C++ program is difficult, and as far as I know none have been proven correct. This is why the standard does not attempt to provide a complete formal grammar, and why it chooses to write some of the parsing rules in technical English.</p>\n\n<p>What looks like a formal grammar in the C++ standard is not the complete formal definition of the syntax of the C++ language. It's not even the complete formal definition of the language after preprocessing, which might be easier to formalize. (That wouldn't be the language, though: the C++ language as defined by the standard includes the preprocessor, and the operation of the preprocessor is described algorithmically since it would be extremely hard to describe in any grammatical formalism. It is in that section of the standard where lexical decomposition is described, including the rules where it must be applied more than once.)</p>\n\n<p>The various grammars (two overlapping grammars for lexical analysis, one which takes place before preprocessing and the other, if necessary, afterwards, plus the \"syntactic\" grammar) are collected in Appendix A, with this important note (emphasis added):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This summary of C++ syntax is intended to be an aid to comprehension. <b>It is not an exact statement of the language</b>. In particular, the grammar described here accepts a <i>superset of valid C++ constructs</i>. Disambiguation rules (6.8, 7.1, 10.2) must be applied to distinguish expressions from declarations. Further, access control, ambiguity, and type rules must be used to weed out syntactically valid but meaningless constructs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally, here's the promised program. Line 21 is syntactically correct if and only if the N in <code>IsPrime&lt;N&gt;</code> is prime. Otherwise, <code>typen</code> is an integer, not a template, so <code>typen&lt;1&gt;()</code> is parsed as <code>(typen&lt;1)&gt;()</code> which is syntactically incorrect because <code>()</code> is not a syntactically valid expression.</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;bool V&gt; struct answer { answer(int) {} bool operator()(){return V;}};\n\ntemplate&lt;bool no, bool yes, int f, int p&gt; struct IsPrimeHelper\n  : IsPrimeHelper&lt;p % f == 0, f * f &gt;= p, f + 2, p&gt; {};\ntemplate&lt;bool yes, int f, int p&gt; struct IsPrimeHelper&lt;true, yes, f, p&gt; { using type = answer&lt;false&gt;; };\ntemplate&lt;int f, int p&gt; struct IsPrimeHelper&lt;false, true, f, p&gt; { using type = answer&lt;true&gt;; };\n\ntemplate&lt;int I&gt; using IsPrime = typename IsPrimeHelper&lt;!(I&amp;1), false, 3, I&gt;::type;\ntemplate&lt;int I&gt;\nstruct X { static const int i = I; int a[i]; }; \n\ntemplate&lt;typename A&gt; struct foo;\ntemplate&lt;&gt;struct foo&lt;answer&lt;true&gt;&gt;{\n  template&lt;int I&gt; using typen = X&lt;I&gt;;\n};\ntemplate&lt;&gt; struct foo&lt;answer&lt;false&gt;&gt;{\n  static const int typen = 0;\n};\n\nint main() {\n  auto b = foo&lt;IsPrime&lt;234799&gt;&gt;::typen&lt;1&gt;(); // Syntax error if not prime\n  return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[1] To put it more technically, every production in a context-sensitive grammar must be of the form:</p>\n\n<p><code>&alpha;A&beta; &rightarrow; &alpha;&gamma;&beta;</code></p>\n\n<p>where <code>A</code> is a non-terminal and <code>&alpha;</code>, <code>&beta;</code> are possibly empty sequences of grammar symbols, and <code>&gamma;</code> is a non-empty sequence. (Grammar symbols may be either terminals or non-terminals). </p>\n\n<p>This can be read as <code>A &rightarrow; &gamma;</code> only in the context <code>[&alpha;, &beta;]</code>. In a context-free (Type 2) grammar, <code>&alpha;</code> and <code>&beta;</code> must be empty.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that you can also restrict grammars with the \"monotonic\" restriction, where every production must be of the form:</p>\n\n<p><code>&alpha; &rightarrow; &beta;</code> where <code>|&alpha;| &ge; |&beta;| &gt; 0</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<code>|&alpha;|</code> means \"the length of <code>&alpha;</code>\")</p>\n\n<p>It's possible to prove that the set of languages recognized by monotonic grammars is exactly the same as the set of languages recognized by context-sensitive grammars, and it's often the case that it's easier to base proofs on monotonic grammars. Consequently, it's pretty common to see \"context-sensitive\" used as though it meant \"monotonic\".</p>\n", "title": "Is C++ context-free or context-sensitive?", "tags": ["c++", "syntax", "grammar", "context-free-grammar", "context-sensitive-grammar"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14589346/is-c-context-free-or-context-sensitive/14589567#14589567", "question_id": 14589346, "answer_id": 14589567}, {"body": "<p>I have a feeling that there's some confusion between the formal definition of \"context-sensitive\" and the informal use of \"context-sensitive\".

Some of what most people see as ambiguity in the current language could (I believe) be resolved unambiguously with a context sensitive grammar.</p>\n\n<p>For the most obvious example, let's consider the Most Vexing Parse: <code>int f(X);</code>. If <code>X</code> is a value, then this defines <code>f</code> as a variable that will be initialized with <code>X</code>. If <code>X</code> is a type, it defines <code>f</code> as a function taking a single parameter of type <code>X</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at that from a grammatical viewpoint, we could view it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A variable_decl ::= &lt;type&gt; &lt;identifier&gt; '(' initializer ')' ';'\n\nB function_decl ::= &lt;type&gt; &lt;identifier&gt; '(' param_decl ')' ';'\n\nA ::= [declaration of X as value]\nB ::= [declaration of X as type]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course, to be entirely correct we'd need to add some extra \"stuff\" to account for the possibility of intervening declarations of other types (i.e., A and B should both really be \"declarations including declaration of X as...\", or something on that order).</p>\n\n<p>This is still rather different from a typical CSG though (or at least what I recall of them).

Unfortunately, my question remains \"locked\" so I cannot post this as answer, only edit the question. Please vote to re-open this question. For C#, I used Xamarin.Android ver. 4.7.09001 (beta). The source code, all the data I used for testing, and compiled APK packages are on GitHub:</p>\n\n<p>Java: <a href=\"https://github.com/gregko/TtsSetup_Java\">https://github.com/gregko/TtsSetup_Java</a></p>\n\n<p>C#: <a href=\"https://github.com/gregko/TtsSetup_C_sharp\">https://github.com/gregko/TtsSetup_C_sharp</a></p>\n\n<p>If someone would like to repeat my tests on other devices or emulators, I'd be interested to learn the results as well.</p>\n\n<h1>Results from my testing</h1>\n\n<p>I ported my sentence extractor class to C# (from my @Voice Aloud Reader app) and run some tests on 10 html files in English, Russian, French, Polish and Czech languages. Each run was performed 5 times on all 10 files, and the total time for 3 different devices and one emulator are posted below. I tested \"Release\" builds only, without debugging enabled.</p>\n\n<h3>HTC Nexus One Android 2.3.7 (API 10) - CyanogenMod ROM</h3>\n\n<p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 12361 ms, with file reading total: 13304 ms</p>\n\n<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 17504 ms, with file reading total: 17956 ms</p>\n\n<h3>Samsung Galaxy S2 SGH-I777 (Android 4.0.4, API 15) - CyanogenMod ROM</h3>\n\n<p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 8947 ms, with file reading total: 9186 ms</p>\n\n<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 9884 ms, with file reading total: 10247 ms</p>\n\n<h3>Samsung GT-N7100 (Android 4.1.1 JellyBean, API 16) - Samsung ROM</h3>\n\n<p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 9742 ms, with file reading total: 10111 ms</p>\n\n<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 10459 ms, with file reading total: 10696 ms</p>\n\n<h3>Emulator - Intel (Android 4.2, API 17)</h3>\n\n<p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 2699 ms, with file reading total: 3127 ms</p>\n\n<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 2049 ms, with file reading total: 2182 ms</p>\n\n<h3>Emulator - Intel (Android 2.3.7, API 10)</h3>\n\n<p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 2992 ms, with file reading total: 3591 ms</p>\n\n<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 2049 ms, with file reading total: 2257 ms</p>\n\n<h3>Emulator - Arm (Android 4.0.4, API 15)</h3>\n\n<p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 41751 ms, with file reading total: 43866 ms</p>\n\n<p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 44136 ms, with file reading total: 45109 ms</p>\n\n<h1>Brief discussion</h1>\n\n<p>My test code contains mainly text parsing, replacing and Regex searches, perhaps for other code (e.g. more numeric operations) the results would be different. On all devices with ARM processors, Java performed better than Xamarin C# code. The largest difference was under Android 2.3, where C# code run at approx. 70% of Java speed.</p>\n\n<p>On Intel emulator (with Intel HAX technology, emulator runs in fast virt mode), Xamarin C# code runs my sample code much faster than Java - about 1.35 time faster. Maybe Mono virtual machine code and libraries are much better optimized on Intel than on ARM?</p>\n\n<h1>Edit July 8, 2013</h1>\n\n<p>I just installed Genymotion Android emulator, which runs in Oracle VirtualBox, and again this one uses native Intel processor, not emulating ARM processor. As with Intel HAX emulator, again C# runs here much faster. Here are my results:</p>\n\n<h3>Genymotion emulator - Intel (Android 4.1.1, API 16)</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Java:\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 2069 ms, with file reading total: 2248 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>C#:\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 1543 ms, with file reading total: 1642 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I then noticed that there was an update to Xamarin.Android beta, version 4.7.11, with release notes mentioning some changes in Mono runtime as well. Decided to quickly test some ARM devices, and big surprise - C# numbers improved:</p>\n\n<h3>BN Nook XD+, ARM (Android 4.0)</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 8103 ms, with file reading total: 8569 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 7951 ms, with file reading total: 8161 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wow! C# is now better than Java? Decided to repeat the test on my Galaxy Note 2:</p>\n\n<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - ARM (Android 4.1.1)</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 9675 ms, with file reading total: 10028 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 9911 ms, with file reading total: 10104 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here C# seems to be only slightly slower, but these numbers gave me a pause: Why the time is longer than on Nook HD+, even though Note 2 has a faster processor? The answer: power saving mode. On Nook, it was disabled, on Note 2 - enabled. Decided to test with power saving mode disabled (as with enabled, it also limits the processor speed):</p>\n\n<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2 - ARM (Android 4.1.1), power saving disabled</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 7153 ms, with file reading total: 7459 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 6906 ms, with file reading total: 7070 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, surprisingly, C# is slightly faster than Java on ARM processor as well. Big improvement!</p>\n\n<h1>Edit July 12, 2013</h1>\n\n<p>We all know, that nothing beats native code for speed, and I was not satisfied with the performance of my sentence splitter in Java or C#, particularly that I need to improve it (and thus make it even slower). Decided to re-write it in C++. Here is a small (i.e. a smaller set of files than previous tests, for other reasons) comparison of the speed of native vs. Java on my Galaxy Note 2, with power saving mode disabled:</p>\n\n<p>Java:\nGrand total time (5 runs): 3292 ms, with file reading total: 3454 ms</p>\n\n<p>Native thumb:\nGrand total time (5 runs): 537 ms, with file reading total: 657 ms</p>\n\n<p>Native arm:\nGrand total time (5 runs): 458 ms, with file reading total: 587 ms</p>\n\n<p>Looks like for my particular test, the native code is 6 to 7 times faster than Java. Caveat: could not use std::regex class on Android, so had to write my own specialized routines searching for paragraphs breaks or html tags. My initial tests of the same code on a PC using regex, were about 4 to 5 times faster than Java.</p>\n\n<p>Phew! Waking raw memory with char* or wchar* pointers again, I instantly felt 20 years younger! :)</p>\n\n<h1>Edit July 15, 2013</h1>\n\n<p><em><strong>(Please see below, with edits of 7/30/2013, for much better results with Dot42)</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>With some difficulty I manged to port my C# tests to Dot42 (version 1.0.1.71 beta), another C# platform for Android. Preliminary results show that Dot42 code is about 3x (3 times) slower than Xamarin C# (v. 4.7.11), on an Intel Android emulator. One problem is, that System.Text.RegularExpressions class in Dot42 does not have the Split() function that I used in Xamarin tests, so I used Java.Util.Regex class instead, and Java.Util.Regex.Pattern.Split(), so in this particular place in the code there is this small difference. Should not be a big problem though. Dot42 compiles to Dalvik (DEX) code, so it cooperates with Java on Android natively, does not need expensive interop from C# to Java like Xamarin.</p>\n\n<p>Just for comparison, I also run the test on ARM devices - here Dot42 code is \"only\" 2x slower than Xamarin C#. Here are my results:</p>\n\n<h3>HTC Nexus One Android 2.3.7 (ARM)</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 12187 ms, with file reading total: 13200 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Xamarin C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 13935 ms, with file reading total: 14465 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Dot42 C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 26000 ms, with file reading total: 27168 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Android 4.1.1 (ARM)</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 6895 ms, with file reading total: 7275 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Xamarin C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 6466 ms, with file reading total: 6720 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Dot42 C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 11185 ms, with file reading total: 11843 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Intel emulator, Android 4.2 (x86)</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Java: Grand total time (5 runs): 2389 ms, with file reading total: 2770 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Xamarin C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 1748 ms, with file reading total: 1933 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Dot42 C#: Grand total time (5 runs): 5150 ms, with file reading total: 5459 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To me it was also interesting to note that Xamarin C# is slightly faster than Java on a newer ARM device, and slightly slower on the old Nexus One. If anyone would like to run these tests as well, please let me know and I'll update the sources on GitHub. It would be particularly interesting to see results from a real Android device with Intel processor.</p>\n\n<h2>Update 7/26/2013</h2>\n\n<p>Just a quick update, re-compiled by benchmark apps with the latest Xamarin.Android 4.8, and also with dot42 1.0.1.72 update released today - no significant changes from the results reported before.</p>\n\n<h2>Update 7/30/2013 - better results for dot42</h2>\n\n<p>Re-tested Dot42 with Robert's (from dot42 makers) port of my Java code to C#. In my C# port done initially for Xamarin, I replaced some native Java classes, like ListArray, with List class native to C#, etc. Robert did not have my Dot42 source code, so he ported it again from Java and used original Java classes in such places, which benefits Dot42, I guess because it runs in Dalvik VM, like Java, and not in Mono, like Xamarin. Now Dot42 results are much better. Here is a log from my testing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h2>7/30/2013 - Dot42 tests with more Java classes in Dot42 C#</h2>\n  \n  <h2>Intel emulator, Android 4.2</h2>\n  \n  <p>Dot42, Greg's Code using StringBuilder.Replace() (as in Xamarin):<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 3646 ms, with file reading total: 3830 ms </p>\n  \n  <p>Dot42, Greg's Code using String.Replace() (as in Java and Robert's code):<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 3027 ms, with file reading total: 3206 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Dot42, Robert's Code:<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 1781 ms, with file reading total: 1999 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Xamarin:<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 1373 ms, with file reading total: 1505 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Java:<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 1841 ms, with file reading total: 2044 ms</p>\n  \n  <h2>ARM, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, power saving off, Android 4.1.1</h2>\n  \n  <p>Dot42, Greg's Code using StringBuilder.Replace() (as in Xamarin):<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 10875 ms, with file reading total: 11280 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Dot42, Greg's Code using String.Replace() (as in Java and Robert's code):<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 9710 ms, with file reading total: 10097 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Dot42, Robert's Code:<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 6279 ms, with file reading total: 6622 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Xamarin:<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 6201 ms, with file reading total: 6476 ms</p>\n  \n  <p>Java:<br>\n  Grand total time (5 runs): 7141 ms, with file reading total: 7479 ms</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I still think that Dot42 has a long way to go. Having Java-like classes (e.g. ArrayList) and a good performance with them, would make porting code from Java to C# slightly easier. However, this is something I would not be likely to do a lot. I would rather want to use existing C# code (libraries etc.), which will use native C# classes (e.g. List), and that would perform slowly with the current dot42 code, and very well with Xamarin.</p>\n\n<p>Greg</p>\n", "title": "Does anyone have benchmarks (code &amp; results) comparing performance of Android apps written in Xamarin C# and Java?", "tags": ["c#", "java", "android", "xamarin", "dot42"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>Yeah, Xamarin's Mono virtual machine is more impressive than Google's Dalvik used in Android.

Understanding better how the dropdown works with Chrome helped :) Basically, the dropdown will be displayed when you focus the input and when you generate a mouse down event when you are typing an entry which matches with what Chrome has in memory. Keeping that in mind, and that Chrome does it for certain inputs when they have default names like \"name\", \"email\", etc. then we just need to remove the name when the dropdown is going to be displayed and add it back after :) I wanted to use a solution which can make it work just by adding the attribute autocomplete off. I thought it made sense. This is the code:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 1</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>jQuery('body').on('mousedown','[name=\"name\"][autocomplete=\"off\"], [name=\"email\"][autocomplete=\"off\"]',function(e){\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    if(typeof this.currentName ==\"undefined\")\n        this.currentName=jQuery(this).attr('name');\n    jQuery(this).attr('name','');\n});\n\njQuery('body').on('blur','[autocomplete=\"off\"]',function(e){\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    jQuery(this).attr('name',this.currentName);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 2 (My Favourite One)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The solution I described above will remove the name of the input until we remove the focus (blur), in that moment it will put the original name back. But might happen that we are interested on having access to the input through its name attribute while we are typing. Which means that we need to put the name back right after each input. This solution, basically is based on the first solution. In this case, we will add the name on key down, and put it back on keyup. I think this is more neat for compatibility with what the \"autocomplete off\" behaviour should be. Anyway this is the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jQuery('body').on('mousedown keydown','[name=\"name\"][autocomplete=\"off\"], [name=\"email\"][autocomplete=\"off\"]',function(e){\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    if(typeof this.currentName ==\"undefined\")\n        this.currentName=jQuery(this).attr('name');\n    jQuery(this).attr('name','');\n});\njQuery('body').on('blur keyup','[autocomplete=\"off\"]',function(e){\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    if(typeof this.currentName !=\"undefined\")\n        jQuery(this).attr('name',this.currentName);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Please notice that for Solution 1 and 2, I just took the cases where the input name is \"name\" and \"email\". For any other case where this attribute makes Chrome generate the dropdown you will have to add it in the selector for the mouse down event.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 3</strong></p>\n\n<p>This solution is a lot more messy. I did not realize that the behaviour we are trying to correct is just based on those inputs with a specific name like \"name, email, etc\". The approach of this solution was for that case that Chrome display for other names that we don't know a priori. It would be a very generic solution. I do not like as much as the other 2, basically because there could be a small flicker when we press on the delete key. I will explain that bellow.</p>\n\n<p>I found out that the dropdown was appearing after a second click on the input but not on the first click when you focus the first time on the input. I bind a \"mousedown\" event for all this elements where the handler basically detect if it is already focused on the input and in case it detects another \"mouse down\", force a .blur() and then .focus() after, preventing the dropdown on the second click once it is focused. I hope, it is clear, just in case here is the code that I used:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jQuery('body').on('mousedown','[autocomplete=\"off\"]',function(e){\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    if(jQuery(this).is(':focus')) {\n        jQuery(this).blur();\n        jQuery(this).focus();\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the other hand, in order to prevent the dropdown while you are typing in case it matches with Chrome suggestions... This is a little bit tricky. I just decided to replace the default behaviour of an input while user types. The dropdown evaluates the input on mouse down, so I prevent the default behaviour for alphanumerics, space, etc. The only problem is with Command,Ctrl and delete. For this case I had to bind also an event on mouse up. It allows the default behaviour in the first two cases so you can make copy, and paste, or select all. In the case of the delete, I have to allow the default behaviour, but if after deleting a character the input matches with Chrome suggestions, then again it was showing the dropdown. For this case I had to use the same trick of blur and focus. The only inconvenience I found on this is that since we are cancelling the behaviour on keyup, and chrome tries to show it on keydown, there is a small flicker. Anyway, this is the best I could do. Probably it will require for filtering of characters at one point. I just added the conditions made more sense for now. This is the second part of the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jQuery('body').on('keydown','[autocomplete=\"off\"]',function(e){\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    var ctrlKey = 17,cmKey = 91;\n    var charCode = e.which || e.keyCode;\n\n    if(charCode!=16 &amp;&amp; this.commandDown != true &amp;&amp; this.ctrlDown != true &amp;&amp; ((charCode&gt;47 &amp;&amp; charCode&lt;58)||(charCode&gt;64 &amp;&amp; charCode&lt;91)||(charCode&gt;96 &amp;&amp; charCode&lt;123)||charCode==0 || charCode==32)){ \n        e.preventDefault();\n        var charStr = String.fromCharCode(charCode);\n        if(!e.shiftKey)\n            charStr = charStr.toLowerCase(charStr);\n        $(this).val($(this).val() + charStr);\n    }else{\n        if (charCode == cmKey) this.commandDown = true;\n        if (charCode == ctrlKey) this.ctrlDown = true;\n    }\n});\njQuery('body').on('keyup','[autocomplete=\"off\"]',function(e){\n    e.stopImmediatePropagation();\n    var allowed=[8];//Delete\n    var ctrlKey = 17,cmKey = 91;\n    var charCode = e.which || e.keyCode;\n\n    if (charCode == cmKey) {this.commandDown = false};\n    if (charCode == ctrlKey) {this.ctrlDown = false};\n    if(allowed.indexOf(charCode)&gt;=0 || (this.commandDown!=false &amp;&amp; this.ctrlDown!=false)){\n        jQuery(this).blur();\n        jQuery(this).focus();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As I said this solution is much more messy. It was the first one I used until I realized that the dropdown just appeared for certain input names. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry for writing so much, I just wanted to be sure everything was clear.

I use mvc.asp c# and when I use @Html.PasswordFor() the password is not added to the input box. This is a good thing. I have coded around this. But using @Html.TextBoxFor() and the password will be added to the input box, and then hidden as a password. However as my passwords are hashed up, the password in the input box is the hashed up password and should never be posted back to the server - accidentally saving a hashed up hashed password would be a pain for someone trying to log in.

When using it. The object does however make the promise that it will execute the operation at some time and give you the result when you request it. This means that it will block when you request the result and hasn't finished, but execute in the thread pool otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>From there you can optimize things: some operations can be implemented async and you can optimize things like file IO and network communication by batching together subsequent requests and/or reordering them. I'm not sure if this is already in the task framework of Microsoft - but if it isn't that would be one of the first things I would add.</p>\n\n<p>You can actually implement the future pattern sort-of with yields in C# 4.0.

It can observe/watch an \"expression\", where the expression can be either a function or a string.  If the expression is a string, it is <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$parse\">$parse</a>'d (i.e., evaluated as an <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression\">Angular expression</a>) into a function.  (It is this function that is called every digest cycle.)  The string expression can not contain {{}}'s.  $watch is a method on the <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope\">Scope</a> object, so it can be used/called wherever you have access to a scope object, hence in </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a controller -- any controller -- one created via ng-view, ng-controller, or a directive controller</li>\n<li>a linking function in a directive, since this has access to a scope as well</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because strings are evaluated as Angular expressions, $watch is often used when you want to observe/watch a model/scope property.  E.g., <code>attr1=\"myModel.some_prop\"</code>, then in a controller or link function: <code>scope.$watch('myModel.some_prop', ...)</code> or <code>scope.$watch(attrs.attr1, ...)</code> (or <code>scope.$watch(attrs['attr1'], ...)</code>).\n<br>(If you try <code>attrs.$observe('attr1')</code> you'll get the string <code>myModel.some_prop</code>, which is probably not what you want.)</p>\n\n<p>As discussed in comments on @PrimosK's answer, all $observes and $watches are checked every <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts\">digest cycle</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Directives with isolate scopes are more complicated.  If the '@' syntax is used, you can $observe <em>or $watch</em> a DOM attribute that contains interpolation (i.e., {{}}'s).  (The reason it works with $watch is because the '@' syntax does the <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$interpolate\">interpolation</a> for us, hence $watch sees a string without {{}}'s.)  To make it easier to remember which to use when, I suggest using $observe for this case also.</p>\n\n<p>To help test all of this, I wrote a <a href=\"http://plnkr.co/edit/HBha8sVdeCqhJtQghGxw?p=preview\">Plunker</a> that defines two directives.  One (<code>d1</code>) does not create a new scope, the other (<code>d2</code>) creates an isolate scope.  Each directive has the same six attributes.  Each attribute is both $observe'd and $watch'ed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div d1 attr1=\"{{prop1}}-test\" attr2=\"prop2\" attr3=\"33\" attr4=\"'a_string'\"\n        attr5=\"a_string\" attr6=\"{{1+aNumber}}\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Look at the console log to see the differences between $observe and $watch in the linking function.  Then click the link and see which $observes and $watches are triggered by the property changes made by the click handler.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that when the link function runs, any attributes that contain {{}}'s are not evaluated yet (so if you try to examine the attributes, you'll get <code>undefined</code>).  The only way to see the interpolated values is to use $observe (or $watch if using an isolate scope with '@').  Therefore, getting the values of these attributes is an <em>asynchronous</em> operation.  (And this is why we need the $observe and $watch functions.)</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes you don't need $observe or $watch.  E.g., if your attribute contains a number or a boolean (not a string), just evaluate it once: <code>attr1=\"22\"</code>, then in, say, your linking function: <code>var count = scope.$eval(attrs.attr1)</code>.  If it is just a constant string &ndash; <code>attr1=\"my string\"</code> &ndash; then just use <code>attrs.attr1</code> in your directive (no need for $eval()).</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/angular/TbRQhG-G14I/bYcipV1OYwcJ\">Vojta's google group post</a> about $watch expressions.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS : Difference between the $observe and $watch methods", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14876112/angularjs-difference-between-the-observe-and-watch-methods/14907826#14907826", "question_id": 14876112, "answer_id": 14907826}, {"body": "<p>I think this is pretty obvious :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$observe is used in linking function of directives.</li>\n<li>$watch is used on scope to watch any changing in its values.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Keep in mind</em> : both the function has two arguments,</p>\n\n<pre><code>$observe/$watch(value : string, callback : function);\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>value</strong> : is always a string reference to the watched element (the name of a scope's variable or the name of the directive's attribute to be watched)</li>\n<li><strong>callback</strong> : the function to be executed of the form <code>function (oldValue, newValue)</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I have made a <a href=\"http://plnkr.co/edit/n4h0wjcRZDSQBeN2RyyG?p=preview\" rel=\"nofollow\"><kbd>plunker</kbd></a>, so you can actually get a grasp on both their utilization.

At the moment I'm using Devise with HTTP sessions which was pretty easy to set up and it's working well.</p>\n\n<p>The application consists of <strong>one</strong> URL providing an AJAX web application. The rest of the URLs available belong to the REST API. So everything and every little data request is done via AJAX.</p>\n\n<p>Now I'd like to extend the whole thing to support native clients. I read a lot about stateless auth, http basic and digest auth, http sessions, cookies, xsrf, etc... And now I feel like I can't have a secure app, because there's always a way to hijack some parts of it.</p>\n\n<h2>1.: HTTP session Vs. stateless auth token</h2>\n\n<p>What's the difference? I don't get it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>HTTP session:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Client requests a URL (first request to the server)</li>\n<li>Server gives the normal response <strong>plus</strong> some unique string (== session ID)</li>\n<li>Client has to send this string with every request (which is done automatically using HTTP header)</li>\n<li>Client logs in -> Server memorizes that this particular session ID is now logged in</li>\n<li>Client visits a page which requires auth -> Nothing special to do, because the session ID will automatically get sent to the server via HTTP header</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>stateless auth token:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Client request URL (first request to the server)</li>\n<li>Server just gives the normal response <strong>without</strong> any key or token or id</li>\n<li>(nothing special here)</li>\n<li>Client logs in -> Server creates an auth token and sends this token to the client inside the response</li>\n<li>Client visits page which requires auth -> Client has to submit the auth token</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For me both ways look pretty similar. With Rails I can also choose to store the session inside the database... Devise would do the same with the stateless auth token. </p>\n\n<h2>2.: The authentication method</h2>\n\n<p>Right now I'm using <code>POST /users/sign_in</code> with <code>{\"user\":{\"email\":\"e@mail.com\",\"password\":\"p455w0rd\"}}</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But there are other possibilities like HTTP basic auth and HTTP digest auth, but also solutions like oAuth (too big for my purpose).</p>\n\n<p>From what I've read:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Concerning <strong>sign_in</strong> security there's no difference between the current <code>POST /users/sign_in</code> and HTTP basic auth. Both use cleartext.</li>\n<li>For <strong>sign_out</strong> HTTP basic auth has a disadvantage: Sign out is only possible closing the browser window</li>\n<li>HTTP digest auth has a huge advantage: It doesn't transmit the password at all (just a hash of password <strong>plus</strong> random generated string)</li>\n<li>(German) Wikipedia says: HTTP digest auth is not supported by all browsers. Maybe this information is way to old?!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What I need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>usernames and <strong>hashed</strong> passwords (bcrypt) stored in a database.</li>\n<li>user can change his password and the password has <strong>not</strong> to be sent in plaintext. (The same problem occurs when it comes to user sign_up). Possible solutions?\n<ol>\n<li>of course: using SSL/TLS</li>\n<li>client request a <code>want_to_change_password_salt</code> and uses it to encrypt the password on client side. <strong>but</strong> (?!) this way I'd sent an essential part of the hashed password over the wire <strong>plus</strong> the hashed password. Sounds insecure to me?!</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>3.: CSRF Token</h2>\n\n<p>As said above, right now I have just a normal AJAX website using the REST API. It has XSRF protection: The website gets delivered by rails and thus has embedded the XSRF token. I read it using AJAX and transmit it when doing a <code>POST</code>. Rails then returns the requested data and a new XSRF token, which I then use for the next <code>POST</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now I want to change my server application to work with native clients. A native client won't load the HTML page and thus won't retrieve a CSRF token. So the following options came to my mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a XSRF token REST resource. So the (native) client has to request a XSRF token from this resource before it can do the first <code>POST</code>.</li>\n<li>Disable XSRF protection entirely.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How does XSRF protection work (in Rails)? How does the server know which token belongs to which client? The only way I can think of are sessions. This assumption leads to:</li>\n<li>If I disable session in order to create a fully stateless REST API, XSRF protection won't work anymore. Right?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>4.: Stateless auth token</h2>\n\n<p>Here I have mostly a lot of questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Does it have the same security problems as HTTP sessions? What I mean: Stealing the session ID has the same effect as stealing the auth token. Right?</li>\n<li>Expiration of the auth token should work the same as with HTTP sessions: The server has to store somewhere (database respectively session) a timestamp and check that.</li>\n<li>sign_out works the same, too?\n<ul>\n<li>Session: Destroy session on the server</li>\n<li>Auth token: Destroy the token on the server</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>From what I've read it should be more secure to store the auth token inside the HTTP header (just like session ID), because server logs can contain <code>GET</code> parameters and thus could contain the token.</li>\n<li>Should it just be a plain auth token or would it be better if the client also transmits its user_id or even the hashed password? <a href=\"http://security.stackexchange.com/a/30710\">HERE</a> I read that the client should send:\n<ol>\n<li><code>user_id</code></li>\n<li><code>expiration_date</code></li>\n<li>a hash (or what's HMAC?) of [<code>user_id</code>, <code>expiration_date</code>, <code>SECRET_KEY</code>]. Where <code>SECRET_KEY</code> is basically a random string generated by the server.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Sorry for the huuuge post, but security is essential! And I don't want to make design mistakes which could probably expose private data.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you :)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Here's a bit of new information and new questions <code>;-)</code>:</p>\n\n<h2>5.: Native Clients</h2>\n\n<p>As far as native clients are concerned, there's no (<em>easy</em>) way to use sessions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A native client is <strong>no browser</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Thus it won't easily handle cookies (and without cookies there's no typical session handling)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So there are 3 possible choices:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Implement session handling for native clients. This would be like:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Login</li>\n<li>read HTTP Header of response to get the cookies</li>\n<li>save all cookie data you need (especially the one with the session stuff) locally</li>\n<li>send this session id with every request you do</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Don't use sessions at all. From the point of view of a native client it's pretty much the same as <em>1.</em>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Login</li>\n<li>Get some authentication token from HTTP Header or response body (it's your app, though it's up to you)</li>\n<li>save this token locally</li>\n<li>send this token with every request</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>The hybrid approach. This basically means, that the server has to distinguish between browser and native client and then check the provided session id and session data or (for native clients) check the provided auth token.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>6.: CSRF Token with stateless (= no session/no cookies) auth</h2>\n\n<p>CSRF Protection protects your users from malicious websites, that try to do some request on your API in the name of your logged in user, but without your user knowing it. That's pretty simple when using sessions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>User logs in at your API</li>\n<li>Session get's created</li>\n<li>Your users browser will have a cookie set with this session ID</li>\n<li>Every request your user does do your API is automatically authenticated, because the browser will send all cookies (including the session id) along with each request to your API</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>And thus the attacking website simply has to do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Write a custom HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> which points to your API</li>\n<li>Let the user somehow click the <code>Submit</code> button</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Of course this form will be something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;form action=\"http://your.api.com/transferMoney\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"receiver\" value=\"ownerOfTheEvilSite\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"amount\" value=\"1000.00\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"WIN MONEY!!\" /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This leads to the following <strong>assumptions</strong>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>CSRF Protection is only needed because browsers automatically send cookies.</p></li>\n<li><p>Native clients to not need CSRF Protection (of course: your browser can't access the authentication data (token, cookie, whatever) of your native app, and your native app won't use a browser to communicate with the API)</p></li>\n<li><p>If you've got an API design which doesn't use Cookies to authenticate the user, there's no possibility to do CSRF. Because the attacker must know the authentication token and explicitly send it along with the malicious request.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you want to oversecure your app, you can of course use CSRF Tokens along with you stateless authentication mechanism, but I'm pretty sure, that there's no additional security gain.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>7.: The right HTTP Methods to choose</h2>\n\n<p>Login / Sign in and Logout / Sign out:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Never</strong> use <code>GET</code> for (at least) three reason:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>CSRF Protection in most cases only protects POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE and thus a CSRF could login a user without his knowledge when using a GET request</p></li>\n<li><p>GET requests should <strong>never</strong> change the application state. But when i.e. using Sessions the application state changes on login/logout, because a session gets created or destroyed.</p></li>\n<li><p>When using a GET request and transmitting the authentication information as URL parameters (i.e. <code>http://your.api.com/login?username=foo&amp;password=bar</code>) there is another problem: Server logs! Most servers simply log every HTTP request including all URL parameters. That means: If your server get's hacked, there's no need to crack the password hashes from your DB, they must just have a look at the server's log files. In addition a malicious admin could also read the login information for every user. Solutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use POST (or whatever method you like) and send the authentication information inside the request body. Or:</li>\n<li>Send the authentication information within the HTTP headers. Because those information normally do not appear in the server log files. Or:</li>\n<li>Have a look at the server config, and tell it to remove every URL parameter that is named \"password\" (or obfuscate is, so the URL becomes <code>login?username=foo&amp;password=***</code> inside the logs). But I suggest, to simply use the request body for this kind of information along with the POST method.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So you could use for example:</p>\n\n<p><code>POST http://your.api.com/authentication</code> for login</p>\n\n<p><code>DELETE http://your.api.com/authentication</code> for logout</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>8.: Passwords and Hashing</h2>\n\n<p>Authentication only works with some secret key. And of course this key should be kept secret. This means:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Never</strong> store a password in plaintext in your database. There are several libraries available to make it secure. In my opinion the best option is <code>bcrypt</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>bcrypt</strong>: It's been optimized to hash passwords. It automatically generates a salt and hashes the password multiple times (rounds). In addition the generated hash-string contains everything needed: Number of rounds, salt and hash. Though you just need to store this one String and there's no need to write anything by hand.</p></li>\n<li><p>of course you can also use any other strong hashing library. But for most of them, you've got to implement salting and using more than 1 rounds yourself. Additionally they wont give you just a single string like bcrypt does, though you've got to manage yourself to store rounds, salt and hash and reassemble it afterwards.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>rounds</strong>: This is simply how often the password should be hashed. When using 5000 rounds the hashing function will return <em>the hash of the hash of the hash of the hash of the password</em>. There's basically a single reason to do this: It costs CPU Power! This means: When someone tries to bruteforce your hash, it takes 5000 times longer when using 5000 rounds. For your application itself it doesn't matter that much: If the user knows his password, he will not recognize, if the server took 0.0004ms or 2ms to validate it.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>good passwords</strong>: The best hashing function is useless, if the password is too simple. If it can be cracked, using a dictionary, it doesn't really matter if you hashed it with 5000 rounds: It will maybe take a few hours longer, but what are a few hours, if it could be months or years? Though make sure, that your user's passwords contain the usual recommendations (lower + upper case + numbers + special chars, etc. pp.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>9.: Sending encrypted passwords over the wire</h2>\n\n<p>If you can't (or don't want to) rely on HTTPS, but don't want to send passwords in cleartext when signing in, you can use asymmetric cryptography ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography</a> ).</p>\n\n<p>This server creates a key pair (public key and private key). The public key is made available to the clients, the private key has to be kept private!</p>\n\n<p>The client can now encrypt data using the public key, and this data can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key (= the server).</p>\n\n<p>This should not(!) be used to store passwords in the database, because if your server gets hacked, the hacker will have the encrypted passwords <strong>and</strong> the private key for decryption. Though keep using some hashing algorithm (like bcrypt) for storing passwords in your database. Another reason is, that you can easily generate a new key pair, if you think that someone cracked you encryption.</p>\n\n<p>HTTPS basically works the same way. Though, if your application uses HTTPS (which is recommended) there might be no big benefit in terms of security. But as stated above, if you can't use HTTPS for whatever reason or don't trust it, that's a way to craft your own secure connection. </p>\n\n<p>And keep in mind that a real HTTPS connection encrypts the whole(!) connection and all data, not only password data. And it encrypts it both ways, from client to server <strong>and</strong> server to client.</p>\n", "title": "How to do authentication with a REST API right?

Using unsigned 8 bit for simplicity. Imagine your number is <code>xxaxxbxx</code> and you want <code>ab000000</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The solution consisted of two steps: a bit masking, followed by multiplication. The bit mask is a simple AND operation that turns uninteresting bits to zeros. In the above case, your mask would be <code>00100100</code> and the result <code>00a00b00</code>. </p>\n\n<p>Now the hard part: turning that into <code>ab......</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A multiplication is a bunch of shift-and-add operations. The key is to allow overflow to \"shift away\" the bits we don't need and put the ones we want in the right place.</p>\n\n<p>Multiplication by 4 (<code>00000100</code>) would shift everything left by 2 and get you to <code>a00b0000</code> .  To get the <code>b</code> to move up we need to multiply by 1 (to keep the a in the right place) + 4 (to move the b up). This sum is 5, and combined with the earlier 4 we get a magic number of 20, or <code>00010100</code>. The original was <code>00a00b00</code> after masking; the multiplication gives:</p>\n\n<pre><code>000000a00b000000\n00000000a00b0000 +\n----------------\n000000a0ab0b0000\nxxxxxxxxab......\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>From this approach you can extend to larger numbers and more bits.</p>\n\n<p>One of the questions you asked was \"can this be done with any number of bits?\" I think the answer is \"no\", unless you allow several masking operations, or several multiplications. The problem is the issue of \"collisions\" - for example, the \"stray b\" in the problem above. Imagine we need to do this to a number like <code>xaxxbxxcx</code>. Following the earlier approach, you would think we need {x 2, x {1 + 4 + 16}} = x 42 (oooh - the answer to everything!). Result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>00000000a00b00c00\n000000a00b00c0000\n0000a00b00c000000\n-----------------\n0000a0ababcbc0c00\nxxxxxxxxabc......\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it still works, but \"only just\". They key here is that there is \"enough space\" between the bits we want that we can squeeze everything up. I could not add a fourth bit d right after c, because I would get instances where I get c+d, bits might carry, ...</p>\n\n<p>So without formal proof, I would answer the more interesting parts of your question as follows: \"No, this will not work for any number of bits. To extract N bits, you need (N-1) spaces between the bits you want to extract, or have additional mask-multiply steps.\"</p>\n\n<p>The only exception I can think of for the \"must have (N-1) zeros between bits\" rule is this: if you want to extract two bits that are adjacent to each other in the original, AND you want to keep them in the same order, then you can still do it. And for the purpose of the (N-1) rule they count as two bits. </p>\n\n<p>There is another insight - inspired by the answer of @Ternary below (see my comment there). For each interesting bit, you only need as many zeros to the right of it as you need space for bits that need to go there. But also, it needs as many bits to the left as it has result-bits to the left. So if a bit b ends up in position m of n, then it needs to have m-1 zeros to its left, and n-m zeros to its right. Especially when the bits are not in the same order in the original number as they will be after the re-ordering, this is an important improvement to the original criteria. This means, for example, that a 16 bit word</p>\n\n<pre><code>a...e.b...d..c..\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can be shifted into</p>\n\n<pre><code>abcde...........\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>even though there is only one space between e and b, two between d and c, three between the others. Whatever happened to N-1?? In this case, <code>a...e</code> becomes \"one block\" - they are multiplied by 1 to end up in the right place, and so \"we got e for free\". The same is true for b and d (b needs three spaces to the right, d needs the same three to its left). So when we compute the magic number, we find there are duplicates:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a: &lt;&lt; 0  ( x 1    )\nb: &lt;&lt; 5  ( x 32   )\nc: &lt;&lt; 11 ( x 2048 )\nd: &lt;&lt; 5  ( x 32   )  !! duplicate\ne: &lt;&lt; 0  ( x 1    )  !! duplicate\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clearly, if you wanted these numbers in a different order, you would have to space them further. We can reformulate the <code>(N-1)</code> rule: \"It will always work if there are at least (N-1) spaces between bits; or, if the order of bits in the final result is known, then if a bit b ends up in position m of n, it needs to have m-1 zeros to its left, and n-m zeros to its right.\"</p>\n\n<p>@Ternary pointed out that this rule doesn't quite work, as there can be a carry from bits adding \"just to the right of the target area\" - namely, when the bits we're looking for are all ones. Continuing the example I gave above with the five tightly packed bits in a 16 bit word: if we start with</p>\n\n<pre><code>a...e.b...d..c..\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For simplicity, I will name the bit positions <code>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP</code></p>\n\n<p>The math we were going to do was</p>\n\n<pre><code>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP\n\na000e0b000d00c00\n0b000d00c0000000\n000d00c000000000\n00c0000000000000 +\n----------------\nabcded(b+c)0c0d00c00\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Until now, we thought anything below <code>abcde</code> (positions <code>ABCDE</code>) would not matter, but in fact, as @Ternary pointed out, if <code>b=1, c=1, d=1</code> then <code>(b+c)</code> in position <code>G</code> will cause a bit to carry to position <code>F</code>, which means that <code>(d+1)</code> in position <code>F</code> will carry a bit into <code>E</code> - and our result is spoilt. Note that space to the right of the least significant bit of interest (<code>c</code> in this example) doesn't matter, since the multiplication will cause padding with zeros from beyone the least significant bit.</p>\n\n<p>So we need to modify our (m-1)/(n-m) rule. If there is more than one bit that has \"exactly (n-m) unused bits to the right (not counting the last bit in the pattern - \"c\" in the example above), then we need to strengthen the rule - and we have to do so iteratively!</p>\n\n<p>We have to look not only at the number of bits that meet the (n-m) criterion, but also the ones that are at (n-m+1), etc. Let's call their number Q0 (exactly <code>n-m</code> to next bit), Q1 (n-m+1), up to Q(N-1) (n-1).

Suppose a sliding piece (rook, bishop, queen) on a certain origin square can move to at most <code>K</code> squares if no blocking pieces were present. Using bitwise-and of those scattered <code>K</code> bits with the bitboard of occupied squares gives a specific <code>K</code>-bit word embedded within a 64-bit integer. </p>\n\n<p>Magic multiplication can be used to map these scattered <code>K</code> bits to the lower <code>K</code> bits of a 64-bit integer. These lower <code>K</code> bits can then be used to index a table of pre-computed bitboards that representst the allowed squares that the piece on its origin square can actually move to (taking care of blocking pieces etc.) </p>\n\n<p>A typical chess engine using this approach has 2 tables (one for rooks, one for bishops, queens using the combination of both) of 64 entries (one per origin square) that contain such pre-computed results. Both the highest rated closed source (<a href=\"http://www.talkchess.com/forum/viewtopic.php?topic_view=threads&amp;p=368026&amp;t=35858\"><strong>Houdini</strong></a>) and open source chess engine (<a href=\"https://github.com/mcostalba/Stockfish/blob/master/src/bitboard.cpp\"><strong>Stockfish</strong></a>) currently use this approach for its very high performance.</p>\n\n<p>Finding these magic multipliers is done either using an <a href=\"http://www.pradu.us/old/Nov27_2008/Buzz/research/magic/Bitboards.pdf\"><strong>exhaustive search</strong></a> (optimized with early cutoffs) or with <a href=\"http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Looking+for+Magics\"><strong>trial and erorr</strong></a> (e.g. trying lots of random 64-bit integers). There have been no bit patterns used during move generation for which no magic constant could be found. However, bitwise carry effects are typically necessary when the to-be-mapped bits have (almost) adjacent indices. </p>\n\n<p>AFAIK, the very general SAT-solver approachy by @Syzygy has not been used in computer chess, and neither does there appear to be any formal theory regarding existence and uniqueness of such magic constants.</p>\n", "title": "Extracting bits with a single multiplication", "tags": ["c", "multiplication", "bit-manipulation"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14547087/extracting-bits-with-a-single-multiplication/15998814#15998814", "question_id": 14547087, "answer_id": 15998814}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14547087/extracting-bits-with-a-single-multiplication", "question_id": 14547087}, {"body": "<p>I'm trying to add a directory to my path so it will always be in my Linux path.

During the\n  development of computer science over the past few decades it became clear that an abstract\n  description of these data is desirable, for example to ensure that one's program does not depend on the particular representation of the data on which it operates. Also, such abstractness facilitates correctness proofs.<br/>\n  This desire led to the use of algebraic methods in computer science, in a branch called algebraic specification or abstract data type theory. The object of study are data types in themselves, using notions of techniques which are familiar from algebra. The data types used by computer scientists are often generated from a given collection of (constructor) operations,and it is for this reason that \"initiality\" of algebras plays such an important role.<br/>\n  Standard algebraic techniques have proved useful in capturing various essential aspects of data structures used in computer science. But it turned out to be difficult to algebraically describe some of the inherently dynamical structures occurring in computing. Such structures usually involve a notion of state, which can be transformed in various ways. Formal approaches to such state-based dynamical systems generally make use of automata or transition systems, as classical early references.<br/>\n  During the last decade the insight gradually grew that such state-based systems should not be described as algebras, but as so-called co-algebras. These are the formal dual of algebras, in a way which will be made precise in this tutorial. The dual property of \"initiality\" for algebras, namely finality turned out to be crucial for such co-algebras. And the logical reasoning principle that is needed for such final co-algebras is not induction but co-induction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Prelude, about Category theory.</strong>\nCategory theory should be rename theory of functors.\nAs categories are what one must define in order to define functors.\n(Moreover, functors are what one must define in order to define natural transformations.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's a functor?</strong>\nIt's a transformation from one set to another which preserving their structure.\n(For more detail there is a lot of good description on the net).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What's is an F-algebra?</strong>\nIt's the algebra of functor.\nIt's just the study of the universal propriety of functor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can it be link to computer science ?</strong>\nProgram can be view  as a structured set of information.\nProgram's execution correspond to modification of this structured set of information.\nIt sound good that execution should preserve the program structure.\nThen execution can be view as the application of a functor over this set of information.\n(The one defining the program).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why F-co-algebra ?</strong>\nProgram are dual by essence as they are describe by information and they act on it.\nThen mainly the information which compose program and make them changed can be view in two way.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Data which can be define as the information being processed by the program.</li>\n<li>State which can be define as the information being shared by the program.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then at this stage, I'd like to say that,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>F-algebra is the study of functorial transformation acting over Data's Universe (as been defined here).</li>\n<li>F-co-algebras is the study of functorial transformation acting on State's Universe (as been defined here).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>During the life of a program, data and state co-exist, and they complete each other.\nThey are dual.</p>\n", "title": "What does &quot;coalgebra&quot; mean in the context of programming?", "tags": ["scala", "haskell", "functional-programming", "programming-languages", "category-theory"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/16015645#16015645", "question_id": 16015020, "answer_id": 16015645}, {"body": "<h1>Algebras</h1>\n\n<p>I think the place to start would be to understand the idea of an <strong>algebra</strong>. This is just a generalization of algebraic structures like groups, rings, monoids and so on. Most of the time, these things are introduced in terms of sets, but since we're among friends, I'll talk about Haskell types instead. (I can't resist using some Greek letters though\u2014they make everything look cooler!)</p>\n\n<p>An algebra, then, is just a type <code>\u03c4</code> with some functions and identities. These functions take differing numbers of arguments of type <code>\u03c4</code> and produce a <code>\u03c4</code>: uncurried, they all look like <code>(\u03c4, \u03c4,\u2026, \u03c4) \u2192 \u03c4</code>. They can also have \"identities\"\u2014elements of <code>\u03c4</code> that have special behavior with some of the functions.</p>\n\n<p>The simplest example of this is the monoid. A monoid is any type <code>\u03c4</code> with a function <code>mappend \u2237 (\u03c4, \u03c4) \u2192 \u03c4</code> and an identity <code>mzero \u2237 \u03c4</code>. Other examples include things like groups (which are just like monoids except with an extra <code>invert \u2237 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4</code> function), rings, lattices and so on.</p>\n\n<p>All the functions operate on <code>\u03c4</code> but can have different arities. We can write these out as <code>\u03c4\u207f \u2192 \u03c4</code>, where <code>\u03c4\u207f</code> maps to a tuple of <code>n</code> <code>\u03c4</code>. This way, it makes sense to think of identities as <code>\u03c4\u2070 \u2192 \u03c4</code> where <code>\u03c4\u2070</code> is just the empty tuple <code>()</code>. So we can actually simplify the idea of an algebra now: it's just some type with some number of functions on it.</p>\n\n<p>An algebra is just a common pattern in mathematics that's been \"factored out\", just like we do with code. People noticed that a whole bunch of interesting things\u2014the aforementioned monoids, groups, lattices and so on\u2014all follow a similar pattern, so they abstracted it out. The advantage of doing this is the same as in programming: it creates reusable proofs and makes certain kinds of reasoning easier.</p>\n\n<h2>F-Algebras</h2>\n\n<p>However, we're not quite done with factoring. So far, we have a bunch of functions <code>\u03c4\u207f \u2192 \u03c4</code>. We can actually do a neat trick to combine them all into one function. In particular, let's look at monoids: we have <code>mappend \u2237 (\u03c4, \u03c4) \u2192 \u03c4</code> and <code>mempty \u2237 () \u2192 \u03c4</code>. We can turn these into a single function using a sum type\u2014<code>Either</code>. It would look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>op \u2237 Monoid \u03c4 \u21d2 Either (\u03c4, \u03c4) () \u2192 \u03c4\nop (Left (a, b)) = mappend (a, b)\nop (Right ())    = mempty\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can actually use this transformation repeatedly to combine <em>all</em> the <code>\u03c4\u207f \u2192 \u03c4</code> functions into a single one, for <em>any</em> algebra. (In fact, we can do this for any number of functions <code>a \u2192 \u03c4</code>, <code>b \u2192 \u03c4</code> and so on for <em>any</em> <code>a, b,\u2026</code>.)</p>\n\n<p>This lets us talk about algebras as a type <code>\u03c4</code> with a <em>single</em> function from some mess of <code>Either</code>s to a single <code>\u03c4</code>. For monoids, this mess is: <code>Either (\u03c4, \u03c4) ()</code>; for groups (which have an extra <code>\u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4</code> operation), it's: <code>Either (Either (\u03c4, \u03c4) \u03c4) ()</code>. It's a different type for every different structure. So what do all these types have in common? The most obvious thing is that they are all just sums of products\u2014algebraic data types. For example, for monoids, we could create a monoid argument type that works for <em>any</em> monoid \u03c4:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data MonoidArgument \u03c4 = Mappend \u03c4 \u03c4 -- here \u03c4 \u03c4 is the same as (\u03c4, \u03c4)\n                      | Mempty      -- here we can just leave the () out\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can do the same thing for groups and rings and lattices and all the other possible structures.</p>\n\n<p>What else is special about all these types? Well, they're all <code>Functors</code>! E.g.: </p>\n\n<pre><code>instance Functor MonoidArgument where\n  fmap f (Mappend \u03c4 \u03c4) = Mappend (f \u03c4) (f \u03c4)\n  fmap f Mempty        = Mempty\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So we can generalize our idea of an algebra even more. It's just some type <code>\u03c4</code> with a function <code>f \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4</code> for some functor <code>f</code>. In fact, we could write this out as a typeclass:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Functor f \u21d2 Algebra f \u03c4 where\n  op \u2237 f \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is often called an \"F-algebra\" because it's determined by the functor <code>F</code>. If we could partially apply typeclasses, we could define something like <code>class Monoid = Algebra MonoidArgument</code>. </p>\n\n<h1>Coalgebras</h1>\n\n<p>Now, hopefully you have a good grasp of what an algebra is and how it's just a generalization of normal algebraic structures. So what is an F-coalgebra? Well, the co implies that it's the \"dual\" of an algebra\u2014that is, we take an algebra and flip some arrows. I only see one arrow in the above definition, so I'll just flip that:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Functor f \u21d2 CoAlgebra f \u03c4 where\n  coop \u2237 \u03c4 \u2192 f \u03c4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that's all it is! Now, this conclusion may seem a little flippant (heh). It tells you <em>what</em> a coalgebra is, but does not really give any insight on how it's useful or why we care. I'll get to that in a bit, once I find or come up with a good example or two :P.</p>\n\n<h2>Classes and Objects</h2>\n\n<p>After reading around a bit, I think I have a good idea of how to use coalgebras to represent classes and objects. We have a type <code>C</code> that contains all the possible internal states of objects in the class; the class itself is a coalgebra over <code>C</code> which specifies the methods and properties of the objects.</p>\n\n<p>As shown in the algebra example, if we have a bunch of functions like <code>a \u2192 \u03c4</code> and <code>b \u2192 \u03c4</code> for any <code>a, b,\u2026</code>, we can combine them all into a single function using <code>Either</code>, a sum type. The dual \"notion\" would be combining a bunch of functions of type <code>\u03c4 \u2192 a</code>, <code>\u03c4 \u2192 b</code> and so on. We can do this using the dual of a sum type\u2014a product type. So given the two functions above (called <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>), we can create a single one like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>both \u2237 \u03c4 \u2192 (a, b)\nboth x = (f x, g x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The type <code>(a, a)</code> is a functor in the straightforward way, so it certainly fits with our notion of an F-coalgebra. This particular trick lets us package up a bunch of different functions\u2014or, for OOP, methods\u2014into a single function of type <code>\u03c4 \u2192 f \u03c4</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The elements of our type <code>C</code> represent the <em>internal</em> state of the object. If the object has some readable properties, they have to be able to depend on the state. The most obvious way to do this is to make them a function of <code>C</code>. So if we want a length property (e.g. <code>object.length</code>), we would have a function <code>C \u2192 Int</code>. </p>\n\n<p>We want methods that can take an argument and modify state. To do this, we need to take all the arguments and produce a new <code>C</code>. Let's imagine a <code>setPosition</code> method which takes an <code>x</code> and a <code>y</code> coordinate: <code>object.setPosition(1, 2)</code>. It would look like this: <code>C \u2192 ((Int, Int) \u2192 C)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The important pattern here is that the \"methods\" and \"properties\" of the object take the object itself as their first argument. This is just like the <code>self</code> parameter in Python and like the implicit <code>this</code> of many other languages. A coalgebra essentially just encapsulates the behavior of taking a <code>self</code> parameter: that's what the first <code>C</code> in <code>C \u2192 F C</code> is.</p>\n\n<p>So let's put it all together. Let's imagine a class with a <code>position</code> property, a <code>name</code> property and <code>setPosition</code> function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class C\n  private\n    x, y  : Int\n    _name : String\n  public\n    name        : String\n    position    : (Int, Int)\n    setPosition : (Int, Int) \u2192 C\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We need two parts to represent this class. First, we need to represent the internal state of the object; in this case it just holds two <code>Int</code>s and a <code>String</code>. (This is our type <code>C</code>.) Then we need to come up with the coalgebra representing the class.</p>\n\n<pre><code>data C = Obj { x, y  \u2237 Int\n             , _name \u2237 String }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We have two properties to write. They're pretty trivial:</p>\n\n<pre><code>position \u2237 C \u2192 (Int, Int)\nposition self = (x self, y self)\n\nname \u2237 C \u2192 String\nname self = _name self\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now we just need to be able to update the position:</p>\n\n<pre><code>setPosition \u2237 C \u2192 (Int, Int) \u2192 C\nsetPosition self (newX, newY) = self { x = newX, y = newY }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is just like a Python class with its explicit <code>self</code> variables. Now that we have a bunch of <code>self \u2192</code> functions, we need to combine them into a single function for the coalgebra. We can do this with a simple tuple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>coop \u2237 C \u2192 ((Int, Int), String, (Int, Int) \u2192 C)\ncoop self = (position self, name self, setPosition self)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The type <code>((Int, Int), String, (Int, Int) \u2192 c)</code>\u2014for <em>any</em> <code>c</code>\u2014is a functor, so <code>coop</code> does have the form we want: <code>Functor f \u21d2 C \u2192 f C</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Given this, <code>C</code> along with <code>coop</code> form a coalgebra which specifies the class I gave above. You can see how we can use this same technique to specify any number of methods and properties for our objects to have.</p>\n\n<p>This lets us use coalgebraic reasoning to deal with classes. For example, we can bring in the notion of an \"F-coalgebra homomorphism\" to represent transformations between classes. This is a scary sounding term that just means a transformation between coalgebras that preserves structure. This makes it much easier to think about mapping classes onto other classes.</p>\n\n<p>In short, an F-coalgebra represents a class by having a bunch of properties and methods that all depend on a <code>self</code> parameter containing each object's internal state.</p>\n\n<h1>Other Categories</h1>\n\n<p>So far, we've talked about algebras and coalgebras as Haskell types. An algebra is just a type <code>\u03c4</code> with a function <code>f \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4</code> and a coalgebra is just a type <code>\u03c4</code> with a function <code>\u03c4 \u2192 f \u03c4</code>. </p>\n\n<p>However, nothing really ties these ideas to Haskell <em>per se</em>. In fact, they're usually introduced in terms of sets and mathematical functions rather than types and Haskell functions. Indeed,we can generalize these concepts to <em>any</em> categories!</p>\n\n<p>We can define an F-algebra for some category <code>C</code>. First, we need a functor <code>F : C \u2192 C</code>\u2014that is, an <em>endofunctor</em>. (All Haskell <code>Functor</code>s are actually endofunctors from <code>Hask \u2192 Hask</code>.) Then, an algebra is just an object <code>A</code> from <code>C</code> with a morphism <code>F A \u2192 A</code>. A coalgebra is the same except with <code>A \u2192 F A</code>.</p>\n\n<p>What do we gain by considering other categories? Well, we can use the same ideas in different contexts. Like monads. In Haskell, a monad is some type <code>M \u2237 \u2605 \u2192 \u2605</code> with three operations:</p>\n\n<pre><code>map      \u2237 (\u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2) \u2192 (M \u03b1 \u2192 M \u03b2)\nreturn   \u2237 \u03b1 \u2192 M \u03b1\njoin     \u2237 M (M \u03b1) \u2192 M \u03b1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>map</code> function is just a proof of the fact that <code>M</code> is a <code>Functor</code>. So we can say that a monad is just a functor with <em>two</em> operations: <code>return</code> and <code>join</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Functors form a category themselves, with morphisms between them being so-called \"natural transformations\". A natural transformation is just a way to transform one functor into another while preserving its structure. <a href=\"http://lukepalmer.wordpress.com/2008/04/28/whats-a-natural-transformation/\">Here's</a> a nice article helping explain the idea. It talks about <code>concat</code>, which is just <code>join</code> for lists.</p>\n\n<p>With Haskell functors, the composition of two functors is a functor itself. In pseudocode, we could write this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>instance (Functor f, Functor g) \u21d2 Functor (f \u2218 g) where\n  fmap fun x = fmap (fmap fun) x\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This helps us think about <code>join</code> as a mapping from <code>f \u2218 f \u2192 f</code>. The type of <code>join</code> is <code>\u2200\u03b1. f (f \u03b1) \u2192 f \u03b1</code>. Intuitively, we can see how a function valid for <em>all</em> types <code>\u03b1</code> can be thought of as a transformation of <code>f</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>return</code> is a similar transformation. Its type is <code>\u2200\u03b1. \u03b1 \u2192 f \u03b1</code>. This looks different\u2014the first <code>\u03b1</code> is not \"in\" a functor! Happily, we can fix this by adding an identity functor there: <code>\u2200\u03b1. Identity \u03b1 \u2192 f \u03b1</code>. So <code>return</code> is a transformation <code>Identity \u2192 f</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can think about a monad as just an algebra based around some functor <code>f</code> with operations <code>f \u2218 f \u2192 f</code> and <code>Identity \u2192 f</code>. Doesn't this look familiar? It's very similar to a monoid, which was just some type <code>\u03c4</code> with operations <code>\u03c4 \u00d7 \u03c4 \u2192 \u03c4</code> and <code>() \u2192 \u03c4</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So a monad is just like a monoid, except instead of having a type we have a functor. It's the same sort of algebra, just in a different category. (This is where the phrase \"A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors\" comes from as far as I know.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, we have these two operations: <code>f \u2218 f \u2192 f</code> and <code>Identity \u2192 f</code>. To get the corresponding coalgebra, we just flip the arrows. This gives us two new operations: <code>f \u2192 f \u2218 f</code> and <code>f \u2192 Identity</code>. We can turn them into Haskell types by adding type variables as above, giving us <code>\u2200\u03b1. f \u03b1 \u2192 f (f \u03b1)</code> and <code>\u2200\u03b1. f \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1</code>. This looks just like the definition of a comonad:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Functor f \u21d2 Comonad f where\n  coreturn \u2237 f \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b1\n  cojoin   \u2237 f \u03b1 \u2192 f (f \u03b1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So a comonad is then a <em>coalgebra</em> in a category of endofunctors.</p>\n", "title": "What does &quot;coalgebra&quot; mean in the context of programming?", "tags": ["scala", "haskell", "functional-programming", "programming-languages", "category-theory"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/16022059#16022059", "question_id": 16015020, "answer_id": 16022059}, {"body": "<p>F-algebras and F-coalgebras are mathematical structures which are instrumental in reasoning about <em>inductive types</em> (or <em>recursive types</em>).</p>\n\n<h1>F-algebras</h1>\n\n<p>We'll start first with F-algebras. I will try to be as simple as possible.</p>\n\n<p>I guess you know what is a recursive type. For example, this is a type for a list of integers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data IntList = Nil | Cons (Int, IntList)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is obvious that it is recursive - indeed, its definition refers to itself. Its definition consists of two data constructors, which have the following types:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Nil  :: () -&gt; IntList\nCons :: (Int, IntList) -&gt; IntList\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that I have written type of <code>Nil</code> as <code>() -&gt; IntList</code>, not simply <code>IntList</code>. These are in fact equivalent types from the theoretical point of view, because <code>()</code> type has only one inhabitant.</p>\n\n<p>If we write signatures of these functions in a more set-theoretical way, we will get</p>\n\n<pre><code>Nil  :: 1 -&gt; IntList\nCons :: Int \u00d7 IntList -&gt; IntList\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>1</code> is a unit set (set with one element) and <code>A \u00d7 B</code> operation is a cross product of two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> (that is, set of pairs <code>(a, b)</code> where <code>a</code> goes through all elements of <code>A</code> and <code>b</code> goes through all elements of <code>B</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Disjoint union of two sets <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> is a set <code>A | B</code> which is a union of sets <code>{(a, 1) : a in A}</code> and <code>{(b, 2) : b in B}</code>. Essentially it is a set of all elements from both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, but with each of this elements 'marked' as belonging to either <code>A</code> or <code>B</code>, so when we pick any element from <code>A | B</code> we will immediately know whether this element came from <code>A</code> or from <code>B</code>.</p>\n\n<p>We can 'join' <code>Nil</code> and <code>Cons</code> functions, so they will form a single function working on a set <code>1 | (Int \u00d7 IntList)</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Nil|Cons :: 1 | (Int \u00d7 IntList) -&gt; IntList\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Indeed, if <code>Nil|Cons</code> function is applied to <code>()</code> value (which, obviously, belongs to <code>1 | (Int \u00d7 IntList)</code> set), then it behaves as if it was <code>Nil</code>; if <code>Nil|Cons</code> is applied to any value of type <code>(Int, IntList)</code> (such values are also in the set <code>1 | (Int \u00d7 IntList)</code>, it behaves as <code>Cons</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Now consider another datatype:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data IntTree = Leaf Int | Branch (IntTree, IntTree)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It has the following constructors:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Leaf   :: Int -&gt; IntTree\nBranch :: (IntTree, IntTree) -&gt; IntTree\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which also can be joined into one function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Leaf|Branch :: Int | (IntTree \u00d7 IntTree) -&gt; IntTree\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It can be seen that both of this <code>joined</code> functions have similar type: they both look like</p>\n\n<pre><code>f :: F T -&gt; T\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>F</code> is a kind of transformation which takes our type and gives more complex type, which consists of <code>x</code> and <code>|</code> operations, usages of <code>T</code> and possibly other types. For example, for <code>IntList</code> and <code>IntTree</code> <code>F</code> looks as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>F1 T = 1 | (Int \u00d7 T)\nF2 T = Int | (T \u00d7 T)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can immediately notice that any algebraic type can be written in this way. Indeed, that is why they are called 'algebraic': they consist of a number of 'sums' (unions) and 'products' (cross products) of other types.</p>\n\n<p>Now we can define F-algebra. <em>F-algebra</em> is just a pair <code>(T, f)</code>, where <code>T</code> is some type and <code>f</code> is a function of type <code>f :: F T -&gt; T</code>. In our examples F-algebras are <code>(IntList, Nil|Cons)</code> and <code>(IntTree, Leaf|Branch)</code>. Note, however, that despite that type of <code>f</code> function is the same for each F, <code>T</code> and <code>f</code> themselves can be arbitrary. For example, <code>(String, g :: 1 | (Int x String) -&gt; String)</code> or <code>(Double, h :: Int | (Double, Double) -&gt; Double)</code> for some <code>g</code> and <code>h</code> are also F-algebras for corresponding F.</p>\n\n<p>Afterwards we can introduce <em>F-algebra homomorphisms</em> and then <em>initial F-algebras</em>, which have very useful properties. In fact, <code>(IntList, Nil|Cons)</code> is an initial F1-algebra, and <code>(IntTree, Leaf|Branch)</code> is an initial F2-algebra. I will not present exact definitions of these terms and properties since they are more complex and abstract than needed.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the fact that, say, <code>(IntList, Nil|Cons)</code> is F-algebra allows us to define <code>fold</code>-like function on this type. As you know, fold is a kind of operation which transforms some recursive datatype in one finite value. For example, we can fold a list of integer into a single value which is a sum of all elements in the list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foldr (+) 0 [1, 2, 3, 4] -&gt; 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is possible to generalize such operation on any recursive datatype.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a signature of <code>foldr</code> function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foldr :: ((a -&gt; b -&gt; b), b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that I have used braces to separate first two arguments from the last one. This is not real <code>foldr</code> function, but it is isomorphic to it (that is, you can easily get one from the other and vice versa). Partially applied <code>foldr</code> will have the following signature:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foldr ((+), 0) :: [Int] -&gt; Int\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can see that this is a function which takes a list of integers and returns a single integer. Let's define such function in terms of our <code>IntList</code> type.</p>\n\n<pre><code>sumFold :: IntList -&gt; Int\nsumFold Nil         = 0\nsumFold (Cons x xs) = x + sumFold xs\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We see that this function consists of two parts: first part defines this function's behavior on <code>Nil</code> part of <code>IntList</code>, and second part defines function's behavior on <code>Cons</code> part.</p>\n\n<p>Now suppose that we are programming not in Haskell but in some language which allows usage of algebraic types directly in type signatures (well, technically Haskell allows usage of algebraic types via tuples and <code>Either a b</code> datatype, but this will lead to unnecessary verbosity). Consider a function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>reductor :: () | (Int \u00d7 Int) -&gt; Int\nreductor ()     = 0\nreductor (x, s) = x + s\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It can be seen that <code>reductor</code> is a function of type <code>F1 Int -&gt; Int</code>, just as in definition of F-algebra! Indeed, the pair <code>(Int, reductor)</code> is an F1-algebra.</p>\n\n<p>Because <code>IntList</code> is an initial F1-algebra, for each type <code>T</code> and for each function <code>r :: F1 T -&gt; T</code> there exist a function, called <em>catamorphism</em> for <code>r</code>, which converts <code>IntList</code> to <code>T</code>, and such function is unique. Indeed, in our example a catamorphism for <code>reductor</code> is <code>sumFold</code>. Note how <code>reductor</code> and <code>sumFold</code> are similar: they have almost the same structure! In <code>reductor</code> definition <code>s</code> parameter usage (type of which corresponds to <code>T</code>) corresponds to usage of the result of computation of <code>sumFold xs</code> in <code>sumFold</code> definition.</p>\n\n<p>Just to make it more clear and help you see the pattern, here is another example, and we again begin from the resulting folding function. Consider <code>append</code> function which appends its first argument to second one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(append [4, 5, 6]) [1, 2, 3] = (foldr (:) [4, 5, 6]) [1, 2, 3] -&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This how it looks on our <code>IntList</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>appendFold :: IntList -&gt; IntList -&gt; IntList\nappendFold ys ()          = ys\nappendFold ys (Cons x xs) = x : appendFold ys xs\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, let's try to write out the reductor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>appendReductor :: IntList -&gt; () | (Int \u00d7 IntList) -&gt; IntList\nappendReductor ys ()      = ys\nappendReductor ys (x, rs) = x : rs\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>appendFold</code> is a catamorphism for <code>appendReductor</code> which transforms <code>IntList</code> into <code>IntList</code>.</p>\n\n<p>So, essentially, F-algebras allow us to define 'folds' on recursive datastructures, that is, operations which reduce our structures to some value.</p>\n\n<h1>F-coalgebras</h1>\n\n<p>F-coalgebras are so-called 'dual' term for F-algebras. They allow us to define <code>unfolds</code> for recursive datatypes, that is, a way to construct recursive structures from some value.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you have the following type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data IntStream = Cons (Int, IntStream)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is an infinite stream of integers. Its only constructor has the following type:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Cons :: (Int, IntStream) -&gt; IntStream\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, in terms of sets</p>\n\n<pre><code>Cons :: Int \u00d7 IntStream -&gt; IntStream\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Haskell allows you to pattern match on data constructors, so you can define the following functions working on <code>IntStream</code>s:</p>\n\n<pre><code>head :: IntStream -&gt; Int\nhead (Cons (x, xs)) = x\n\ntail :: IntStream -&gt; IntStream\ntail (Cons (x, xs)) = xs\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can naturally 'join' these functions into single function of type <code>IntStream -&gt; Int \u00d7 IntStream</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>head&amp;tail :: IntStream -&gt; Int \u00d7 IntStream\nhead&amp;tail (Cons (x, xs)) = (x, xs)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how the result of the function coincides with algebraic representation of our <code>IntStream</code> type. Similar thing can also be done for other recursive data types. Maybe you already have noticed the pattern. I'm referring to a family of functions of type</p>\n\n<pre><code>g :: T -&gt; F T\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>T</code> is some type. From now on we will define</p>\n\n<pre><code>F1 T = Int \u00d7 T\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, <em>F-coalgebra</em> is a pair <code>(T, g)</code>, where <code>T</code> is a type and <code>g</code> is a function of type <code>g :: T -&gt; F T</code>. For example, <code>(IntStream, head&amp;tail)</code> is an F1-coalgebra. Again, just as in F-algebras, <code>g</code> and <code>T</code> can be arbitrary, for example,<code>(String, h :: String -&gt; Int x String)</code> is also an F1-coalgebra for some h.</p>\n\n<p>Among all F-coalgebras there are so-called <em>terminal F-coalgebras</em>, which are dual to initial F-algebras. For example, <code>IntStream</code> is a terminal F-coalgebra. This means that for every type <code>T</code> and for every function <code>p :: T -&gt; F1 T</code> there exist a function, called <em>anamorphism</em>, which converts <code>T</code> to <code>IntStream</code>, and such function is unique.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following function, which generates a stream of successive integers starting from the given one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>nats :: Int -&gt; IntStream\nnats n = Cons (n, nats (n+1))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let's inspect a function <code>natsBuilder :: Int -&gt; F1 Int</code>, that is, <code>natsBuilder :: Int -&gt; Int \u00d7 Int</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>natsBuilder :: Int -&gt; Int \u00d7 Int\nnatsBuilder n = (n, n+1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, we can see some similarity between <code>nats</code> and <code>natsBuilder</code>. It is very similar to the connection we have observed with reductors and folds earlier. <code>nats</code> is an anamorphism for <code>natsBuilder</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Another example, a function which takes a value and a function and returns a stream of successive applications of the function to the value:</p>\n\n<pre><code>iterate :: (Int -&gt; Int) -&gt; Int -&gt; IntStream\niterate f n = Cons (n, iterate f (f n))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Its builder function is the following one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>iterateBuilder :: (Int -&gt; Int) -&gt; Int -&gt; Int \u00d7 Int\niterateBuilder f n = (n, f n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then <code>iterate</code> is an anamorphism for <code>iterateBuilder</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n\n<p>So, in short, F-algebras allow to define folds, that is, operations which reduce recursive structure down into a single value, and F-coalgebras allow to do the opposite: construct a [potentially] infinite structure from a single value.</p>\n\n<p>In fact in Haskell F-algebras and F-coalgebras coincide. This is a very nice property which is a consequence of presence of 'bottom' value in each type. So in Haskell both folds and unfolds can be created for every recursive type. However, theoretical model behind this is more complex than the one I have presented above, so I deliberately have avoided it.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n", "title": "What does &quot;coalgebra&quot; mean in the context of programming?", "tags": ["scala", "haskell", "functional-programming", "programming-languages", "category-theory"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/16022085#16022085", "question_id": 16015020, "answer_id": 16022085}, {"body": "<p>I'll start with stuff that is obviously programming-related and then add on some mathematics stuff, to keep it as concrete and down-to-earth as I can.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Let's quote some computer-scientists on coinduction\u2026</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~micinski/posts/2012-09-04-on-understanding-coinduction.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~micinski/posts/2012-09-04-on-understanding-coinduction.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>Induction is about finite data, co-induction is about infinite data.</h3>\n  \n  <p>The typical example of infinite data is the type of a lazy list (a\n  stream).

If we use this\n  reduction order, then our above program will run forever computing the\n  digits of pi before it can be passed to our printer function (which\n  never happens). Since the machine does not have infinite memory, the\n  program will eventually run out of memory and crash.

Or even better, it should sound like type signatures.</p>\n\n<p>Standard mathematical examples include monoid \u2283 group \u2283 vector-space \u2283 \"an algebra\". Monoids are like automata: sequences of verbs (eg, <code>f.g.h.h.nothing.f.g.f</code>). A <code>git</code> log that always adds history and never deletes it would be a monoid but not a group. If you add inverses (eg negative numbers, fractions, roots, deleting accumulated history, un-shattering a broken mirror) you get a group.</p>\n\n<p>Groups contain things that can be added or subtracted together. For example <code>Duration</code>s can be added together. (But <code>Date</code>s cannot.) Durations live in a vector-space (not just a group) because they can also be scaled by outside numbers. (A type signature of <code>scaling :: (Number,Duration) \u2192 Duration</code>.)</p>\n\n<p>Algebras \u2282 vector-spaces can do yet another thing: there\u2019s some <code>m :: (T,T) \u2192 T</code>. Call this \"multiplication\" or don't, because once you leave <code>Integers</code> it\u2019s less obvious what \"multiplication\" (or <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-is-exponentiation-so-much-more-applicable-to-the-real-world-than-tetration\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Which might seem like a \u00abfree cheat\u00bb to define multiplication, if you already had addition.\">\"exponentiation\"</a>) should be.</p>\n\n<p>(This is why people look to (category-theoretic) universal properties: to tell them what multiplication should <em>do</em> or <em>be like</em>:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/CategoricalProduct-03.svg/400px-CategoricalProduct-03.svg.png\" alt=\"universal property of product\">\n )</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Algebras \u2192 Coalgebras</h3>\n\n<p>Comultiplication is easier to define in a way that feels non-arbitrary, than is multiplication, because to go from <code>T \u2192 (T,T)</code> you can just repeat the same element. (\"diagonal map\" \u2013 like diagonal matrices/operators in spectral theory)</p>\n\n<p>Counit is usually the trace (sum of diagonal entries), although again what's important is what your counit <em>does</em>; <code>trace</code> is just a good answer for matrices.</p>\n\n<p>The reason to look at a <a href=\"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/06/25/the-uncertainty-principle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dual space</a>, in general, is because it's easier to think in that space. For example it's sometimes easier to think about a normal vector than about the plane it's normal to, but you can control planes (including hyperplanes) with vectors (and now I'm speaking of the familiar geometric vector, like in a ray-tracer).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Taming (un)structured data</h3>\n\n<p>Mathematicians might be modelling something fun like <a href=\"//www.math.toronto.edu/drorbn/papers/Cobordism/Cobordism.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">TQFT's</a>, whereas programmers have to wrestle with</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>dates/times (<code>+ :: (Date,Duration) \u2192 Date</code>),</li>\n<li>places (<code>Paris</code> &ne; <code>(+48.8567,+2.3508)</code>!

I believe this is what people mean when they say like \"Algebras are coalgebras in Haskell\". But to the extent that programmers have to model complex data-types like <code>Place</code>, <code>Date/Time</code>, and <code>Customer</code>\u2014and make those models look as much like the real world (or at least the end-user's view of the real world) as possible\u2014I believe duals, could be useful beyond only set-world.</p>\n", "title": "What does &quot;coalgebra&quot; mean in the context of programming?", "tags": ["scala", "haskell", "functional-programming", "programming-languages", "category-theory"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming/32913907#32913907", "question_id": 16015020, "answer_id": 32913907}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16015020/what-does-coalgebra-mean-in-the-context-of-programming", "question_id": 16015020}, {"body": "<p>I have a simple loop with <code>ng-repeat</code> like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;li ng-repeat='task in tasks'&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt; {{task.name}}\n  &lt;button ng-click=\"removeTask({{task.id}})\"&gt;remove&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is a function in the controller <code>$scope.removeTask(taskID)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know Angular will first render the view and replace interpolated <code>{{task.id}}</code> with a number, and then, on click event, will evaluate <code>ng-click</code> string.</p>\n\n<p>In this case <code>ng-click</code> gets totally what is expected, ie: <code>ng-click=\"removeTask(5)\".</code> However... it's not doing anything.</p>\n\n<p>Of course I can write a code to get <code>task.id</code> from the <code>$tasks</code> array or even the DOM, but this does not seem like the Angular way.</p>\n\n<p>So, how can one add dynamic content to <code>ng-click</code> directive inside a <code>ng-repeat</code> loop?</p>\n", "title": "Adding parameter to ng-click function inside ng-repeat doesn&#39;t seem to work", "tags": ["angularjs", "ng-repeat", "angularjs-ng-click"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>Instead of </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click=\"removeTask({{task.id}})\"&gt;remove&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click=\"removeTask(task.id)\"&gt;remove&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please see this fiddle:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/JSWorld/Hp4W7/34/\">http://jsfiddle.net/JSWorld/Hp4W7/34/</a></p>\n", "title": "Adding parameter to ng-click function inside ng-repeat doesn&#39;t seem to work", "tags": ["angularjs", "ng-repeat", "angularjs-ng-click"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17039926/adding-parameter-to-ng-click-function-inside-ng-repeat-doesnt-seem-to-work/17039960#17039960", "question_id": 17039926, "answer_id": 17039960}, {"body": "<p>One thing that really hung me up, was when I inspected this html in the browser, instead of seeing it expanded to something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click=\"removeTask(1234)\"&gt;remove&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I saw:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click=\"removeTask(task.id)\"&gt;remove&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, the latter works! </p>\n\n<p>This is because you are in the \"Angular World\", when inside ng-click=\"\" Angular all ready knows about task.id as you are inside it's model.

This way might not be the most elegant, but it cerntainly works.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple solution you should be able to add to any project.  You can just add a \"pageKey\" or some other property when you configure your route that you can use to key off of. Additionally, you can implement a listener on the $routeChangeSuccess method of the $route object to listen for the successful completion of a route change.</p>\n\n<p>When your handler fires you get the page key, and use that key to locate elements that need to be \"ACTIVE\" for this page, and you apply the ACTIVE class.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind you need a way to make ALL the elements \"IN ACTIVE\".  As you can see i'm using the .pageKey class on my nav items to turn them all off, and I'm using the .pageKey_{PAGEKEY} to individually turn them on. Switching them all to inactive, would be considered a naive approach, potentially you'd get better performance by using the previous route to make only active items inactive, or you could alter the jquery selector to only select active items to be made inactive.  Using jquery to select all active items is probably the best solution because it ensures everything is cleaned up for the current route in case of any css bugs that might have been present on the previous route.</p>\n\n<p>Which would mean changing this line of code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\".pagekey\").toggleClass(\"active\", false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to this one</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(\".active\").toggleClass(\"active\", false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is some sample code:</p>\n\n<p>Given a bootstrap navbar of</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"navbar

The advantage of this is it has fewer dependencies. Heck, it works without a web server too.

Magic happens with the methods <code>selectTab()</code> and <code>getTabClass()</code> defined in the controller for this navbar presented below.</p>\n\n<p>Controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module(\"app.NavigationControllersModule\", [])\n\n// Constant named 'activeTab' holding the value 'active'.

So when the link is clicked, the variable <code>selectedTab</code> is set to the name of this link. In the HTML you can see that this method is called without any argument for Home tab so that it will be highlighted when the page loads.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>getTabClass()</code> method is called via <code>ng-class</code> directive in the HTML. This method checks if the tab it is in is the same as the value of the <code>selectedTab</code> variable. If true, it returns \"active\" else returns \"\" which is applied as the class name by <code>ng-class</code> directive. Then whatever css you have applied to class <code>active</code> will be applied to the selected tab.</p>\n", "title": "How do I implement the bootstrap navbar active class with Angular JS", "tags": ["javascript", "twitter-bootstrap", "angularjs", "angularjs-directive", "navbar"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16199418/how-do-i-implement-the-bootstrap-navbar-active-class-with-angular-js/38813113#38813113", "question_id": 16199418, "answer_id": 38813113}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16199418/how-do-i-implement-the-bootstrap-navbar-active-class-with-angular-js", "question_id": 16199418}], "quota_max": 300, "page_size": 100, "quota_remaining": 287, "page": 1}
