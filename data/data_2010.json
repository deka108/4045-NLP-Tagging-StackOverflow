You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax <code>git push [remotename] :[branch]</code>. If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git push origin :serverfix\nTo git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git\n - [deleted]         serverfix\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>Boom. No more branch on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you\u2019ll need that command, and you\u2019ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the <code>git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch]</code> syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the <code>[localbranch]</code> portion, then you\u2019re basically saying, \u201cTake nothing on my side and make it be <code>[remotebranch]</code>.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I issued <code>git push origin :bugfix</code> and it worked beautifully.

It's not. <strong>I was close, but so very, very wrong. Sorry about that!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've since done lots of <a href=\"http://wonderfl.net/c/dd23/read\">fiddling on wonderfl.net</a> and tracing through the code in <code>mx.rpc.xml.*</code>. At line 1795 of <code>XMLEncoder</code> (in the 3.5 source), in <code>setValue</code>, all of the XMLEncoding boils down to </p>\n\n<pre><code>currentChild.appendChild(xmlSpecialCharsFilter(Object(value)));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is essentially the same as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>currentChild.appendChild(\"null\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code, according to my original fiddle, returns an empty XML element. But why?</p>\n\n<p><H1> Cause </H1></p>\n\n<p>According to commenter Justin Mclean on bug report <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLEX-33644\">FLEX-33664</a>, the following is the culprit (see last two tests in my <a href=\"http://wonderfl.net/c/dd23/read\">fiddle</a> which verify this):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var thisIsNotNull:XML = &lt;root&gt;null&lt;/root&gt;;\nif(thisIsNotNull == null){\n    // always branches here, as (thisIsNotNull == null) strangely returns true\n    // despite the fact that thisIsNotNull is a valid instance of type XML\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When <code>currentChild.appendChild</code> is passed the string <code>\"null\"</code>, it first converts it to a root XML element with text <code>null</code>, and then tests that element against the null literal. This is a weak equality test, so either the XML containing null is coerced to the null type, or the null type is coerced to a root xml element containing the string \"null\", and the test passes where it arguably should fail.

(If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate.

For example, a\n  \"low\" density screen has fewer pixels within a given physical area,\n  compared to a \"normal\" or \"high\" density screen. For simplicity,\n  Android groups all actual screen densities into four generalized\n  densities: low, medium, high, and extra high.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Orientation:</strong> The orientation of the screen from the user's point of view. This is either landscape or portrait, meaning that the\n  screen's aspect ratio is either wide or tall, respectively. Be aware\n  that not only do different devices operate in different orientations\n  by default, but the orientation can change at runtime when the user\n  rotates the device.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> The total number of physical pixels on a screen. When adding support for multiple screens, applications do not work directly\n  with resolution; applications should be concerned only with screen\n  size and density, as specified by the generalized size and density\n  groups.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Density-independent pixel (dp):</strong> A virtual pixel unit that you should use when defining UI layout, to express layout dimensions or\n  position in a density-independent way. The density-independent pixel\n  is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the\n  baseline density assumed by the system for a \"medium\" density screen.\n  At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp\n  units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use.\n  The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is simple: px = dp * (dpi\n  / 160). For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical\n  pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your\n  application's UI, to ensure proper display of your UI on screens with\n  different densities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html#terms\">Android developers site</a></p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between &quot;px&quot;, &quot;dp&quot;, &quot;dip&quot; and &quot;sp&quot; on Android?", "answer_id": 17891222, "question_id": 2025282, "tags": ["android", "android-layout", "user-interface", "dimension", "units-of-measurement"]}, {"body": "<p>Anything related with the size of text and appearance must use <code>sp</code> or <code>pt</code>.

As described above, the density-independent pixel is equivalent to one physical pixel on a 160 dpi screen, which is the baseline density assumed by the system for a \"medium\" density screen. At runtime, the system transparently handles any scaling of the dp units, as necessary, based on the actual density of the screen in use. The conversion of dp units to screen pixels is\nsimple:</p>\n\n<p>px = dp * (dpi / 160).</p>\n\n<p>For example, on a 240 dpi screen, 1 dp equals 1.5 physical pixels. You should always use dp units when defining your application's UI, to ensure\nproper display of your UI on screens with different densities.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding pixel to dp and vice versa is very essential (especially for giving exact dp values to creative team)</p>\n\n<pre><code>dp = px * 160 / dpi\n\nMDPI = 160 dpi || Therefore, on MDPI 1 px = 1 dp\nFor example, if you want to convert 20 pixel to dp, use the above formula,\ndp = 20 * 160 / 160 = 20.\nSo, 20 pixel = 20 dp.\n\nHDPI = 240 dpi - So, on HDPI 1.5 px = 1 dp\nXHDPI = 320 dpi - So, on XHDPI 2 px = 1 dp\nXXHDPI = 480 dpi - So, on XXHDPI 3 px = 1 dp\n\nFor example, let us consider Nexus 4.\nIf 24 pixels to be converted to dp and if it is a Nexus 4 screen, developers can\nconvert it to dp easily by the following calculation :\ndp = 24 * 160 / 320 = 12 dp\nScreen dimension:\n768 x 1280 pixel resolution (320 ppi or 320dpi)\nOptional (screen size):\n 4.7\" diagonal\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Try to get all pixel values in even numbers from the creative team. Otherwise precision lose will happen while multiplying with 0.5.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>px</h3>\n\n<p>It is explained above. Try to avoid in layout files. But there are some cases, where px is required. for example, ListView divider line. px is better here for giving a one-pixel line as a divider for all across screen resolutions.</p>\n\n<h3>sp</h3>\n\n<p>Use sp for font sizes. Then only the font inside the application will change while device fonts size changes (that is, Display -> Fonts on Device). If you want to keep a static sized font inside the app, you can give the font dimension in dp. In such a case, it will never change. Developers may get such a requirement for some specific screens, for that, developers can use dp instead of sp.

For example, a screen classified to 160dpi may have 170dpi indeed. So the computation result of <code>dp</code> is fuzzy. It should be approximately the same as <code>1/160 inch</code>.</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between &quot;px&quot;, &quot;dp&quot;, &quot;dip&quot; and &quot;sp&quot; on Android?", "answer_id": 36368775, "question_id": 2025282, "tags": ["android", "android-layout", "user-interface", "dimension", "units-of-measurement"]}, {"body": "<p>I've come across a good article about designing Android apps UI for different screen resolutions, and I'd like to leave it here just for somebody searching in this area.

It remained unclear for me how to design layouts capable to handle different screen size. I hate DP concept and so on, when I need to implement a \"flexible\" UI layout for different screens. (Hey iOS developers - yes, you're right it's Storyboard concept).</p>\n\n<p>Android has not bad UI concept, but lacks iOS Storyboard features, unfortunately. Designing flexible UI in Android is not easy thing (at the best).</p>\n\n<p>Here goes the article that helped me to understand what to do in Android to make layouts for different screen sizes: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jmsliu.com/1718/decide-android-app-screen-size.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://jmsliu.com/1718/decide-android-app-screen-size.html</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>How to Design UI for Android Apps for Different Screen Size</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>To design an app UI for different screen sizes, our initial design has to\n  meet a minimum required space for each screen size. Android defines a\n  minimum size (in dp) for each generalized screen type. Here is an\n  Android screen size guideline.\n  <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MPEMR.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MPEMR.jpg\" alt=\"Minimum Screen Size for Android in dp\"></a>\n  When we get the screen size in dp, it is not enough for us to design\n  the Android app UI. For each screen size, we need to prepare graphics\n  and bitmap images for each density. Here is an Android screen density\n  guideline.\n  <a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Px14F.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Px14F.jpg\" alt=\"Android Density Guideline (dpi)\"></a></p>\n  \n  <p>For easy calculation, we can follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio between\n  the four generalized densities. If we create a 36\u00d736 pixel picture for\n  ldpi device, the rest densities pictures size will be 48\u00d748 for mdpi,\n  72\u00d772 for hdpi, and 96\u00d796 for xhdpi.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>How to Design Android Apps UI in Photoshop</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Many designers have problems for designing Android app UI in photoshop or other pixel\n  based graphic design tools because of density-independent unit, dp.\n  Designers don\u2019t know how to map dp to pixel. Google also doesn\u2019t give\n  a clear Android UI design guide for them, though they give a basic\n  formula for dp and pixel translation.</p>\n  \n  <p>As Android\u2019s definition, 1pd equal to 1px under 160 dpi device (mdpi).\n  So we want to design an Android app for xlarge Android device with\n  mdpi density, we can define our UI size in pixel as 960 pixel in width\n  and 720px in height; Follow the same mapping rule, we can get\n  following Android App screen size UI design guideline:</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Kt3R.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5Kt3R.jpg\" alt=\"Android App Screen Size in Pixel Guideline\"></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>ADDED</strong>: If you interested in \"flexible\" UI too, have a look at this library: <a href=\"https://github.com/intuit/sdp\" rel=\"nofollow\">An Android SDK that provides a new size unit - sdp (scalable dp).

The first thing that comes up when a conventional programmer thinks of an array (<strong>in PHP</strong>) would be something similar to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$myArray1 = array(2016, \"hello\", 33);//option 1\n\n$myArray2 = [2016, \"hello\", 33];//option 2\n\n$myArray3 = [];//option 3\n$myArray3[] = 2016; \n$myArray3[] = \"hello\"; \n$myArray3[] = 33;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where, if wanted to call the array in some later part of the code, we could do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo $myArray1[1];// output: hello\necho $myArray2[1];// output: hello\necho $myArray3[1];// output: hello\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So far so good. However, as humans, we might find it hard to remember that index <code>[0]</code> of the array is the value of the <strong>year</strong> 2016, index <code>[1]</code> of the array is a <strong>greetings</strong>, and index <code>[2]</code> of the array is a simple <strong>integer value</strong>. The alternative we would then have is to use what is called an <strong>Associative Array</strong>. An Associative array has a few differences from a <strong>Sequential Array</strong>\n(<em>which is what the previous cases were since they increment the index used in a predetermined sequence, by incrementing by 1 for each following value</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Differences (<em>between a sequential and associative array</em>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Durring the declaration of an Associative Array, you don't only include the <code>value</code> of what you want to put in the array, but you also put the index value (called the <code>key</code>) which you want to use when calling the array in later parts of the code. The following syntax is used during it's declaration: <code>\"key\" =&gt; \"value\"</code>. </p></li>\n<li><p>When using the Associative Array, the <code>key</code> value would then be placed inside the index of the array to retrieve the desired <code>value</code>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $myArray1 = array( \n        \"Year\" =&gt; 2016, \n        \"Greetings\" =&gt; \"hello\", \n        \"Integer_value\" =&gt; 33);//option 1\n\n    $myArray2 = [ \n        \"Year\" =&gt;  2016, \n        \"Greetings\" =&gt; \"hello\", \n        \"Integer_value\" =&gt; 33];//option 2\n\n    $myArray3 = [];//option 3\n    $myArray3[\"Year\"] = 2016; \n    $myArray3[\"Greetings\"] = \"hello\"; \n    $myArray3[\"Integer_value\"] = 33;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now, to receive the same output as before, the <code>key</code> value would be used in the arrays index:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo $myArray1[\"Greetings\"];// output: hello\necho $myArray2[\"Greetings\"];// output: hello\necho $myArray3[\"Greetings\"];// output: hello\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>FINAL POINT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So from the above example, it is pretty easy to see that the <code>=&gt;</code> symbol is used to express the relationship of an Associative Array between each of the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> pairs in an array <strong>DURING</strong> the initiation of the values within the array.</p>\n", "title": "Reference - What do &lt;various symbols&gt; mean in PHP?", "answer_id": 37773515, "question_id": 3737139, "tags": ["php", "operators", "symbols"]}], "question_id": 3737139}, {"body": "<p>I have a Flash project, and it has many source files.

She was among her own kind.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Flash would have none of that. Perhaps it had formed an attachment. Perhaps it didn't <em>want</em> Jenine to be decoupled. Either way, it clung to the old, perfect version of Jenine in its memory. It refused to move on. It ignored her (function) calls. It tried to forget her new, public interfaces.

Obviously some users are more paranoid than others, so it might be useful to hash 1 or more of these identifiers, so that the string is still virtually unique to the device, but does not explicitly identify the user's actual device.  For example, using <code>String.hashCode()</code>, combined with a UUID:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    final TelephonyManager tm = (TelephonyManager) getBaseContext().getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE);\n\n    final String tmDevice, tmSerial, androidId;\n    tmDevice = \"\" + tm.getDeviceId();\n    tmSerial = \"\" + tm.getSimSerialNumber();\n    androidId = \"\" + android.provider.Settings.Secure.getString(getContentResolver(), android.provider.Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);\n\n    UUID deviceUuid = new UUID(androidId.hashCode(), ((long)tmDevice.hashCode() &lt;&lt; 32) | tmSerial.hashCode());\n    String deviceId = deviceUuid.toString();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>might result in something like: <code>00000000-54b3-e7c7-0000-000046bffd97</code></p>\n\n<p>It works well enough for me.</p>\n\n<p>As Richard mentions below, don't forget that you need permission to read the <code>TelephonyManager</code> properties, so add this to your manifest:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Is there a unique Android device ID?", "answer_id": 2853253, "question_id": 2785485, "tags": ["java", "android", "uniqueidentifier"]}, {"body": "<p>Also you might consider the Wi-Fi adapter's MAC address.

The ID computed in this way won't be unique: it is possible to find two devices with the same ID (based on the same hardware and rom image) but the chances in real world applications are negligible.

Here's what I discovered about device identifiers that's NOT mentioned in the aforementioned blog post:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ANDROID_ID is the preferred device identifier.  ANDROID_ID is perfectly reliable on versions of Android &lt;=2.1 or >=2.3.  Only 2.2 has the problems mentioned in the post.</li>\n<li>Several devices by several manufacturers are affected by the ANDROID_ID bug in 2.2.</li>\n<li>As far as I've been able to determine, all affected devices have <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=10603\">the same ANDROID_ID</a>, which is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=9774d56d682e549c\">9774d56d682e549c</a>.  Which is also the same device id reported by the emulator, btw.</li>\n<li>Google believes that OEMs have patched the issue for many or most of their devices, but I was able to verify that as of the beginning of April 2011, at least, it's still quite easy to find devices that have the broken ANDROID_ID.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on Google's recommendations, I implemented a class that will generate a unique UUID for each device, using ANDROID_ID as the seed where appropriate, falling back on TelephonyManager.getDeviceId() as necessary, and if that fails, resorting to a randomly generated unique UUID that is persisted across app restarts (but not app re-installations).</p>\n\n<p>Note that for devices that have to fallback on the device ID, the unique ID <strong>WILL</strong> persist across factory resets.  This is something to be aware of.  If you need to ensure that a factory reset will reset your unique ID, you may want to consider falling back directly to the random UUID instead of the device ID.</p>\n\n<p>Again, this code is for a device ID, not an app installation ID.  For most situations, an app installation ID is probably what you're looking for.  But if you do need a device ID, then the following code will probably work for you.</p>\n\n<pre><code>import android.content.Context;\nimport android.content.SharedPreferences;\nimport android.provider.Settings.Secure;\nimport android.telephony.TelephonyManager;\n\nimport java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException;\nimport java.util.UUID;\n\npublic class DeviceUuidFactory {\n\n    protected static final String PREFS_FILE = \"device_id.xml\";\n    protected static final String PREFS_DEVICE_ID = \"device_id\";\n    protected volatile static UUID uuid;\n\n    public DeviceUuidFactory(Context context) {\n        if (uuid == null) {\n            synchronized (DeviceUuidFactory.class) {\n                if (uuid == null) {\n                    final SharedPreferences prefs = context\n                            .getSharedPreferences(PREFS_FILE, 0);\n                    final String id = prefs.getString(PREFS_DEVICE_ID, null);\n                    if (id != null) {\n                        // Use the ids previously computed and stored in the\n                        // prefs file\n                        uuid = UUID.fromString(id);\n                    } else {\n                        final String androidId = Secure.getString(\n                            context.getContentResolver(), Secure.ANDROID_ID);\n                        // Use the Android ID unless it's broken, in which case\n                        // fallback on deviceId,\n                        // unless it's not available, then fallback on a random\n                        // number which we store to a prefs file\n                        try {\n                            if (!\"9774d56d682e549c\".equals(androidId)) {\n                                uuid = UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes(androidId\n                                        .getBytes(\"utf8\"));\n                            } else {\n                                final String deviceId = (\n                                    (TelephonyManager) context\n                                    .getSystemService(Context.TELEPHONY_SERVICE))\n                                    .getDeviceId();\n                                uuid = deviceId != null ?

Anthony Nolan shows the direction in his answer, but I thought I'd write out the full approach so that others can easily see how to do it (it took me a while to figure out the details).</p>\n\n<p>This approach will give you an anonymous, secure user ID which will be persistent for the user across different devices (based on the primary Google account) and across installs. The basic approach is to generate a random user ID and to store this in the apps' shared preferences. You then use Google's backup agent to store the shared preferences linked to the Google account in the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Let's go through the full approach. First, we need to create a backup for our SharedPreferences using the Android Backup Service. Start by registering your app via <code>http://developer.android.com/google/backup/signup.html</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Google will give you a backup service key which you need to add to the manifest. You also need to tell the application to use the BackupAgent as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;application android:label=\"MyApplication\"\n         android:backupAgent=\"MyBackupAgent\"&gt;\n    ...\n    &lt;meta-data android:name=\"com.google.android.backup.api_key\"\n        android:value=\"your_backup_service_key\" /&gt;\n&lt;/application&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then you need to create the backup agent and tell it to use the helper agent for sharedpreferences:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public class MyBackupAgent extends BackupAgentHelper {\n    // The name of the SharedPreferences file\n    static final String PREFS = \"user_preferences\";\n\n    // A key to uniquely identify the set of backup data\n    static final String PREFS_BACKUP_KEY = \"prefs\";\n\n    // Allocate a helper and add it to the backup agent\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate() {\n        SharedPreferencesBackupHelper helper = new SharedPreferencesBackupHelper(this,          PREFS);\n        addHelper(PREFS_BACKUP_KEY, helper);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To complete the backup you need to create an instance of BackupManager in your main Activity:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BackupManager backupManager = new BackupManager(context);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally create a user ID, if it doesn't already exist, and store it in the SharedPreferences:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  public static String getUserID(Context context) {\n            private static String uniqueID = null;\n        private static final String PREF_UNIQUE_ID = \"PREF_UNIQUE_ID\";\n    if (uniqueID == null) {\n        SharedPreferences sharedPrefs = context.getSharedPreferences(\n                MyBackupAgent.PREFS, Context.MODE_PRIVATE);\n        uniqueID = sharedPrefs.getString(PREF_UNIQUE_ID, null);\n        if (uniqueID == null) {\n            uniqueID = UUID.randomUUID().toString();\n            Editor editor = sharedPrefs.edit();\n            editor.putString(PREF_UNIQUE_ID, uniqueID);\n            editor.commit();\n\n            //backup the changes\n            BackupManager mBackupManager = new BackupManager(context);\n            mBackupManager.dataChanged();\n        }\n    }\n\n    return uniqueID;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This User_ID will now be persistent across installations, even if the user moves device.</p>\n\n<p>For more information on this approach see <a href=\"http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/android-protips-advanced-topics-for-expert-android-app-developers.html\">Reto's talk</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And for full details of how to implement the backup agent see <em><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/backup.html\">Data Backup</a></em>. I particularly recommend the section at the bottom on testing as the backup does not happen instantaneously and so to test you have to force the backup.</p>\n", "title": "Is there a unique Android device ID?", "answer_id": 14001180, "question_id": 2785485, "tags": ["java", "android", "uniqueidentifier"]}, {"body": "<p>Another way is to use <code>/sys/class/android_usb/android0/iSerial</code> in an app without any permissions whatsoever.</p>\n\n<pre><code>user@creep:~$ adb shell ls -l /sys/class/android_usb/android0/iSerial\n-rw-r--r-- root     root         4096 2013-01-10 21:08 iSerial\nuser@creep:~$ adb shell cat /sys/class/android_usb/android0/iSerial\n0A3CXXXXXXXXXX5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To do this in Java one would just use a FileInputStream to open the iSerial file and read out the characters.

This way, we can show the user respect and try to offer a good user experience as well.</p>\n\n<p>With a pseudo-unique id, you really only run into the fact that there may be duplicates based on the fact that there are similar devices.

This means that the call above is a blocking call - in my unscientific testing it takes 1-3 seconds if the device is online, and 0.5 - 1.0 seconds if off-line (presumably this is how long it waits before giving up and generating a random ID).

In that case, you pass a function to be called for each item in the list:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myStringArray = [ \"Hello\", \"World\" ];\nmyStringArray.forEach( function(s) { \n     // ... do something with s ...\n} );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But if even that is too much to assume, and you want something that works in <em>all</em> versions of JavaScript, then you have to use an explicit counting loop.  The safest version, which handles sparse arrays properly, is something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var i, s, myStringArray = [ \"Hello\", \"World\" ], len = myStringArray.length;\nfor (i=0; i&lt;len; ++i) {\n  if (i in myStringArray) {\n    s = myStringArray[i];\n    // ... do something with s ...\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assigning the length value to the local variable (as opposed to including the full <code>myStringArray.length</code> expression in the loop condition) can make a significant difference in performance since it skips a property lookup each time through; using Rhino on my machine, the speedup is 43%. </p>\n\n<p>You will often see the length caching done in the loop initialization clause, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var i, len, myStringArray = [ \"Hello\", \"World\" ];\nfor (len = myStringArray.length, i=0; i&lt;len; ++i) {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> syntax mentioned by others is for looping over an object's properties; since an Array in JavaScript is just an object with numeric property names (and an automatically-updated \"length\" property), you can theoretically loop over an Array with it.  But the problem is that it doesn't restrict itself to the numeric property values (remember that even methods are actually just properties whose value is a closure), nor does it iterate over those in numeric order.

Meaning that there actually is a value at each index in the array. However, I found that in practice I hardly ever use sparse arrays in Javascript... In such cases it's usually a lot easier to use an object as a map/hashtable. If you do have a sparse array, and want to loop over 0 .. length-1, you need the for (var i=0; i&lt;someArray.length; ++i) construct, but you still need an if inside the loop to check whether the element at the current index is actually defined.</p>\n\n<p>Also, as CMS mentions in a comment below, you can only use this on arrays that don't contain any falsish values. The array of strings from the example works, but if you have empty strings, or numbers that are 0 or NaN, etc. the loop will break off prematurely. Again in practice this is hardly ever a problem for me, but it is something to keep in mind, which makes this a loop to think about before you use it... That may disqualify it for some people :)</p>\n\n<p>What I like about this loop is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's short to write </li>\n<li>No need to access (let alone cache) the length property </li>\n<li>The item to access is automatically defined within the loop\nbody under the name you pick.</li>\n<li>Combines very naturally with array.push and array.splice to use arrays like lists/stacks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The reason this works is that the array specification mandates that when you read an item from an index >= the array's length, it will return undefined.

Such concepts include procedures / functions, <code>IF</code>-statements, <code>FOR</code>-loops, and <code>WHILE</code>-loops.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>A traditional <code>for</code>-loop</h3>\n\n<p>A traditional <code>for</code> loop has three components:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The initialization:</strong> executed before the look block is executed the first time</li>\n<li><strong>The condition:</strong> checks a condition every time before the loop block is executed, and quits the loop if false</li>\n<li><strong>The afterthought:</strong> performed every time after the loop block is executed</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>These three components are separated from each other by a <code>;</code> symbol. Content for each of these three components is optional, which means that the following is the most minimal <code>for</code> loop possible:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (;;) {\n    // Do stuff\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course, you will need to include an <code>if(condition === true) { break; }</code>  or an <code>if(condition === true) { return; }</code> somewhere inside that <code>for</code>-loop to get it to stop running.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, though, the initialization is used to declare an index, the condition is used to compare that index with a minimum or maximum value, and the afterthought is used to increment the index:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i = 0, length = 10; i &lt; length; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Using a traditional <code>for</code> loop to loop through an array</h3>\n\n<p>The traditional way to loop through an array, is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i = 0, length = myArray.length; i &lt; length; i++) {\n    console.log(myArray[i]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, if you prefer to loop backwards, you do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i = myArray.length - 1; i &gt; -1; i--) {\n    console.log(myArray[i]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are, however, many variations possible, like for example this one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var key = 0, value = myArray[key], length = myArray.length; key &lt; length; value = myArray[++key]) {\n    console.log(value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... or this one ...</p>\n\n<pre><code>var i = 0, length = myArray.length;\nfor (; i &lt; length;) {\n    console.log(myArray[i]);\n    i++;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... or this one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var key = 0, value;\nfor (; value = myArray[key++];){\n    console.log(value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Whichever works best is largely a matter of both personal taste and the specific use case you're implementing.</p>\n\n<p>Note that each of these variations is supported by all browsers, including very very old ones!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>A <code>while</code> loop</h3>\n\n<p>One alternative to a <code>for</code> loop is a <code>while</code> loop. To loop through an array, you could do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var key = 0;\nwhile(value = myArray[key++]){\n    console.log(value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like traditional <code>for</code> loops, <code>while</code> loops are supported by even the oldest of browsers.</p>\n\n<p>Also, note that every while loop can be rewritten as a <code>for</code> loop. For example, the <code>while</code> loop hereabove behaves the exact same way as this <code>for</code>-loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for(var key = 0; value = myArray[key++];){\n    console.log(value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3><code>For...in</code> and <code>for...of</code></h3>\n\n<p>In JavaScript, you can also do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (i in myArray) {\n    console.log(myArray[i]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This should be used with care, however, as it doesn't behave the same as a traditional <code>for</code> loop in all cases, and there are potential side-effects that need to be considered. See <strong><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/500504/why-is-using-for-in-with-array-iteration-such-a-bad-idea\">Why is using &quot;for...in&quot; with array iteration a bad idea?</a></strong> for more details.</p>\n\n<p>As an alternative to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in\"><strong><code>for...in</code></strong></a>, there's now also for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of\"><strong><code>for...of</code></strong></a>. The following example shows the difference between a <code>for...of</code> loop and a <code>for...in</code> loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myArray = [3, 5, 7];\nmyArray.foo = \"hello\";\n\nfor (var i in myArray) {\n  console.log(i); // logs 0, 1, 2, \"foo\"\n}\n\nfor (var i of myArray) {\n  console.log(i); // logs 3, 5, 7\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Additionally, you need to consider that no version of Internet Explorer supports <code>for...of</code> (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge\"><strong>Edge 12+</strong></a> does) and that <code>for...in</code> requires at least Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;10.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3><code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code></h3>\n\n<p>An alternative to <code>for</code>-loops is <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\"><strong><code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code></strong></a>, which uses the following syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myArray.forEach(function(value, key, myArray) {\n    console.log(value);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code> is supported by all modern browsers, as well as Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;9 and later.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Libraries</h3>\n\n<p>Finally, many utility libraries also have their own <code>foreach</code> variation.

Important when thinking about publishing the results (of say American Idol) on your website</li>\n<li>Relative time: eg: This question has an open bounty closing in 21 hours.  This is easy to display</li>\n<li>Recurring time: eg: A TV show is on every Monday at 9pm, even when DST changes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is also Historic/alternate time.  These are annoying because they may not map back to standard time.  Eg: Julian dates, dates according to a Lunar calendar on Saturn, The Klingon calendar.</p>\n\n<p>Storing start/end timestamps in UTC works well.  For 1, you need an event timezone name + offset stored along with the event.  For 2, you need a local time identifier stored with each region and a local timezone name + offset stored for every viewer (it's possible to derive this from the IP if you're in a crunch).  For 3, store in UTC seconds and no need for timezones.  4 is a special case of 1 or 2 depending on whether it's a global or a local event, but you also need to store a <em>created at</em> timestamp so you can tell if a timezone definition changed before or after this event was created.  This is necessary if you need to show historic data.</p>\n\n<h2>Storing times</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Always store time in UTC</li>\n<li>Convert to local time on display (local being defined by the user looking at the data)</li>\n<li>When storing a timezone, you need the name, timestamp and the offset.  This is required because governments sometimes change the meanings of their timezones (eg: the US govt changed DST dates), and your application needs to handle things gracefully... eg: The exact timestamp when episodes of LOST showed both before and after DST rules changed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Offsets and names</h3>\n\n<p>An example of the above would be:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The soccer world cup finals game\n  happened in South Africa (UTC+2--SAST)\n  on July 11, 2010 at 19:00 UTC.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With this information, we can historically determine the exact time when the 2010 WCS finals took place even if the South African timezone definition changes, <strong>and</strong> be able to display that to viewers in their local timezone at the time when they query the database.</p>\n\n<h2>System Time</h2>\n\n<p>You also need to keep your OS, database and application tzdata files in sync, both with each other, and with the rest of the world, and test extensively when you upgrade.

This is indeed a good best practice, but it's there as a band-aid for applications that do not follow other best practices.  For example, a service might be writing to log files with local timestamps instead of UTC-based timestamps, thus creating ambiguities during the daylight saving time fall-back transition.

It is an implementation of the W3C's Document Object Model Core Level 3, a platform- and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure and style of documents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>DOM is capable of parsing and modifying real world (broken) HTML and it can do <a href=\"http://schlitt.info/opensource/blog/0704_xpath.html\">XPath queries</a>. It is based on <a href=\"http://xmlsoft.org/html/libxml-HTMLparser.html\">libxml</a>. </p>\n\n<p>It takes some time to get productive with DOM, but that time is well worth it IMO. Since DOM is a language-agnostic interface, you'll find implementations in many languages, so if you need to change your programming language, chances are you will already know how to use that language's DOM API then.</p>\n\n<p>A basic usage example can be found in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3820666/regular-expression-for-grabbing-the-href-attribute-of-an-a-element/3820783#3820783\">Grabbing the href attribute of an A element</a> and a general conceptual overview can be found at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4979836/noob-question-about-domdocument-in-php/4983721#4983721\">DOMDocument in php</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=DOM+HTML+[PHP]&amp;submit=search\">How to use the DOM extension has been covered extensively on StackOverflow</a>, so if you choose to use it, you can be sure most of the issues you run into can be solved by searching/browsing Stack Overflow.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.xmlreader.php\">XMLReader</a></h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The XMLReader extension is an XML pull parser. The reader acts as a cursor going forward on the document stream and stopping at each node on the way. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>XMLReader, like DOM, is based on libxml. I am not aware of how to trigger the HTML Parser Module, so chances are using XMLReader for parsing broken HTML might be less robust than using DOM where you can explicitly tell it to use libxml's HTML Parser Module.</p>\n\n<p>A basic usage example can be found at <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3299033/getting-all-values-from-h1-tags-using-php/3299140#3299140\">getting all values from h1 tags using php</a></p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.xml.php\">XML Parser</a></h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This extension lets you create XML parsers and then define handlers for different XML events.

In general using Regular Expressions on HTML is discouraged. </p>\n\n<p>Most of the snippets you will find on the web to match markup are brittle. In most cases they are only working for a very particular piece of HTML. Tiny markup changes, like adding whitespace somewhere, or adding or changing attributes in a tag, can make the regex fails when it's not properly written. You should know what you are doing before using regex on HTML.</p>\n\n<p>HTML parsers already know the syntactical rules of HTML. Regular expressions have to be taught for each new regex you write. Regex are fine in some cases, but it really depends on your use-case.</p>\n\n<p>You <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4231382/regular-expression-pattern-not-matching-anywhere-in-string/4234491#4234491\">can write more reliable parsers</a>, but writing a <em>complete and reliable</em> custom parser with regular expressions is a waste of time when the aforementioned libraries already exist and do a much better job on this.</p>\n\n<p>Also see <a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/11/parsing-html-the-cthulhu-way.html\">Parsing Html The Cthulhu Way</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Books</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to spend some money, have a look at</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.phparch.com/books/phparchitects-guide-to-web-scraping-with-php\">PHP Architect's Guide to Webscraping with PHP</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I am not affiliated with PHP Architect or the authors.</p>\n", "title": "How do you parse and process HTML/XML in PHP?", "answer_id": 3577662, "question_id": 3577641, "tags": ["php", "parsing", "xml-parsing", "html-parsing"]}, {"body": "<p>This is commonly referred to as <strong>screen scraping</strong>, by the way.

Regexes can however <em>\"<strong>extract</strong>\"</em> data. Extracting is what they're made for. The major drawback of regex HTML extraction over proper SGML toolkits or baseline XML parsers are their syntactic effort and varying reliability.</p>\n\n<p>Consider that making a somewhat dependable HTML extraction regex:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a\\s+class=\"?playbutton\\d?[^&gt;]+id=\"(\\d+)\".+?    &lt;a\\s+class=\"[\\w\\s]*title\n[\\w\\s]*\"[^&gt;]+href=\"(http://[^\"&gt;]+)\"[^&gt;]*&gt;([^&lt;&gt;]+)&lt;/a&gt;.+?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is way less readable than a simple phpQuery or QueryPath equivalent:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$div-&gt;find(\".stationcool a\")-&gt;attr(\"title\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are however specific use cases where they can help.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Many DOM traversal frontends don't reveal HTML comments <code>&lt;!--</code>, which however are sometimes the more useful anchors for extraction.

However HTML entities often require manual caretaking.</li>\n<li>And lastly, for e<em>xtremely simple tasks</em> like extracting &lt;img src= urls, they are in fact a probable tool. The speed advantage over SGML/XML parsers mostly just comes to play for these very basic extraction procedures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's sometimes even advisable to pre-extract a snippet of HTML using regular expressions <code>/&lt;!--CONTENT--&gt;(.+?)&lt;!--END--&gt;/</code> and process the remainder using the simpler HTML parser frontends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I actually have this <a href=\"http://fossil.include-once.org/streamtuner2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">app</a>, where I employ XML parsing and regular expressions alternatively.

That's also why they're two of the easiest approaches to <em>properly</em> parse HTML in PHP.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Examples for QueryPath</strong></p>\n\n<p>Basically you first create a queryable DOM tree from an HTML string:</p>\n\n<pre><code> $qp = qp(\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;title&lt;/h1&gt;...\"); // or give filename or URL\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The resulting object contains a complete tree representation of the HTML document. It can be traversed using DOM methods. But the common approach is to use CSS selectors like in jQuery:</p>\n\n<pre><code> $qp-&gt;find(\"div.classname\")-&gt;children()-&gt;...;\n\n foreach ($qp-&gt;find(\"p img\") as $img) {\n     print qp($img)-&gt;attr(\"src\");\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Mostly you want to use simple <code>#id</code> and <code>.class</code> or <code>DIV</code> tag selectors for <code>-&gt;find()</code>. But you can also use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath\">XPath</a> statements, which sometimes are faster. Also typical jQuery methods like <code>-&gt;children()</code> and <code>-&gt;text()</code> and particularly <code>-&gt;attr()</code> simplify extracting the right HTML snippets. (And already have their SGML entities decoded.)</p>\n\n<pre><code> $qp-&gt;xpath(\"//div/p[1]\");  // get first paragraph in a div\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>QueryPath also allows injecting new tags into the stream (<code>-&gt;append</code>), and later output and prettify an updated document (<code>-&gt;writeHTML</code>). It can not only parse malformed HTML, but also various XML dialects (with namespaces), and even extract data from HTML microformats (XFN, vCard).</p>\n\n<pre><code> $qp-&gt;find(\"a[target=_blank]\")-&gt;toggleClass(\"usability-blunder\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>phpQuery or QueryPath?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Generally QueryPath is better suited for manipulation of documents. While phpQuery also implements some pseudo AJAX methods (just HTTP requests) to more closely resemble jQuery. It is said that phpQuery is often faster than QueryPath (because of fewer overall features).  </p>\n\n<p>For further information on the differences see <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20101230230134/http://www.tagbytag.org/articles/phpquery-vs-querypath\">this comparison on the wayback machine from tagbyte.org</a>.

 //Fails\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example, <code>JSON.stringify()</code> will throw a <code>TypeError</code> <em>\"Converting circular structure to JSON\"</em>.\n        If storing circular references should be supported, the second parameter of <code>JSON.stringify()</code> might be used:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var obj = {id: 1, sub: {}};\nobj.sub[\"circular\"] = obj;\nlocalStorage.object = JSON.stringify( obj, function( key, value) {\n    if( key == 'circular') {\n        return \"$ref\"+value.id+\"$\";\n    } else {\n        return value;\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, finding an efficient solution for storing circular references highly depends on the tasks that need to be solved, and restoring such data is not trivial either.</p>\n\n<p>There are already some question on SO dealing with this problem: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10392293/stringify-javascript-object-with-circular-reference/12659424#12659424\">Stringify javascript object with circular reference</a></p>\n", "title": "Storing Objects in HTML5 localStorage", "answer_id": 27013704, "question_id": 2010892, "tags": ["javascript", "html5", "local-storage"]}, {"body": "<p>using JSON objects for Local Storage</p>\n\n<p>//SET</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;

To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland. </p>\n\n<p>The one item that bypasses this limitation is &lt;script&gt; tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really <strong>do</strong> anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated.</p>\n\n<p>Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle. </p>\n\n<p>For example, say the server expects a parameter called \"callback\" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-none prettyprint-override\"><code>http://www.example.net/sample.aspx?callback=mycallback\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Without JSONP, this might return some basic JavaScript object, like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ foo: 'bar' }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, with JSONP, when the server receives the \"callback\" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mycallback({ foo: 'bar' });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mycallback = function(data){\n  alert(data.foo);\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now, when the script is loaded, it'll be evaluated, and your function will be executed. Voila, cross-domain requests!</p>\n\n<p>It's also worth noting the one major issue with JSONP: you lose a lot of control of the request. For example, there is no \"nice\" way to get proper failure codes back. As a result, you end up using timers to monitor the request, etc, which is always a bit suspect. The proposition for <a href=\"http://www.json.org/JSONRequest.html\">JSONRequest</a> is a great solution to allowing cross domain scripting, maintaining security, and allowing proper control of the request.</p>\n\n<p>These days (2015), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\">CORS</a> is the recommended approach vs. JSONRequest.

There are important differences between margins and padding that you should take into consideration when choosing which to use to move elements around the page. However, in those cases where either margins or padding could be used to the same effect, a lot of the decision comes down to personal preference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When to use margins</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You want your spacing to appear outside of the \u201cbox\u201d created by a border property. Margins lie outside of borders, so you\u2019d use them if you want your border to stay in one place. This can be useful if you have, for example, a sidebar with a border that you want to move away from your main content area.</p></li>\n<li><p>You don\u2019t want your background color or image to invade your personal space. Background colors and images stop at the border, so if you\u2019d rather keep your backgrounds out of the space you\u2019re making, margins are the property you want.</p></li>\n<li><p>You\u2019d like collapsible space on the top and bottom of your element. Top and bottom margins behave differently than side margins in that if two margins are atop one another, they collapse to the size of the largest margin set. For example, if I set paragraph to have a top margin of 20 pixels and a bottom margin of 15 pixels, I\u2019ll only have 20 pixels of space total between paragraphs (the two margins collapse into one another, and the largest wins out).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>When to use padding</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You want all of the space you\u2019re creating to be inside your border. Padding is contained within your borders, so it\u2019s useful for pushing your borders away from the content inside of your element.</p></li>\n<li><p>You need your background color/image to continue on into the space you\u2019re creating. Your background will continue on behind your padding, so only use it if you want your background to peek out.</p></li>\n<li><p>You want your top and bottom space to behave more rigidly.

As with all such rules, there are indeed exceptions. Sometimes people have deviated from them and the outcome was not bad code, but such positive deviations are few and far between. At the very least, 99 out of 100 such deviations I have seen were unjustified. However, it might just as well have been 999 out of 1000. So you\u2019d better stick to the following rules. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><em><strong>Whenever the meaning of an operator is not obviously clear and undisputed, it should not be overloaded.</em></strong> <em>Instead, provide a function with a well-chosen name.</em><br>\nBasically, the first and foremost rule for overloading operators, at its very heart, says: <em>Don\u2019t do it</em>. That might seem strange, because there is a lot to be known about operator overloading and so a lot of articles, book chapters, and other texts deal with all this. But despite this seemingly obvious evidence, <em>there are only a surprisingly few cases where operator overloading is appropriate</em>. The reason is that actually it is hard to understand the semantics behind the application of an operator unless the use of the operator in the application domain is well known and undisputed. Contrary to popular belief, this is hardly ever the case.  </p></li>\n<li><p><em><strong>Always stick to the operator\u2019s well-known semantics.</em></strong><br>\nC++ poses no limitations on the semantics of overloaded operators. Your compiler will happily accept code that implements the binary <code>+</code> operator to subtract from its right operand. However, the users of such an operator would never suspect the expression <code>a + b</code> to subtract <code>a</code> from <code>b</code>. Of course, this supposes that the semantics of the operator in the application domain is undisputed. </p></li>\n<li><p><em><strong>Always provide all out of a set of related operations.</em></strong><br>\n<em>Operators are related to each other</em> and to other operations. If your type supports <code>a + b</code>, users will expect to be able to call <code>a += b</code>, too. If it supports prefix increment <code>++a</code>, they will expect <code>a++</code> to work as well. If they can check whether <code>a &lt; b</code>, they will most certainly expect to also to be able to check whether <code>a &gt; b</code>. If they can copy-construct your type, they expect assignment to work as well. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Continue to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/operator-overloading-in-c/4421729#4421729\">The Decision between Member and Non-member</a>.</p>\n", "title": "Operator overloading", "answer_id": 4421708, "question_id": 4421706, "tags": ["c++", "operators", "operator-overloading", "c++-faq"]}, {"body": "<h1>The General Syntax of operator overloading in C++</h1>\n\n<p>You cannot change the meaning of operators for built-in types in C++, operators can only be overloaded for user-defined types<sup>1</sup>.

See the basic rules of operator overloading.</p>\n\n<p>In C++, operators are overloaded in the form of <strong><em>functions with special names</em></strong>. As with other functions, overloaded operators can generally be implemented either as a <strong><em>member function of their left operand's type</em></strong> or as <strong><em>non-member functions</em></strong>. Whether you are free to choose or bound to use either one depends on several criteria.<sup>2</sup> A unary operator <code>@</code><sup>3</sup>, applied to an object x, is invoked either as <code>operator@(x)</code> or as <code>x.operator@()</code>. A binary infix operator <code>@</code>, applied to the objects <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, is called either as <code>operator@(x,y)</code> or as <code>x.operator@(y)</code>.<sup>4</sup> </p>\n\n<p>Operators that are implemented as non-member functions are sometimes friend of their operand\u2019s type. </p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>The term \u201cuser-defined\u201d might be slightly misleading.

That is little wonder, since operators are merely syntactic sugar, their actual work could be done by (and often is forwarded to) plain functions. But it is important that you get this boiler-plate code right. If you fail, either your operator\u2019s code won\u2019t compile or your users\u2019 code won\u2019t compile or your users\u2019 code will behave surprisingly.</p>\n\n<h2>Assignment Operator</h2>\n\n<p>There's a lot to be said about assignment. However, most of it has already been said in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/what-is-the-copy-and-swap-idiom\">GMan's famous Copy-And-Swap FAQ</a>, so I'll skip most of it here, only listing the perfect assignment operator for reference:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X&amp; X::operator=(X rhs)\n{\n  swap(rhs);\n  return *this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Bitshift Operators (used for Stream I/O)</h2>\n\n<p>The bitshift operators <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, although still used in hardware interfacing for the bit-manipulation functions they inherit from C, have become more prevalent as overloaded stream input and output operators in most applications.  For guidance overloading as bit-manipulation operators, see the section below on Binary Arithmetic Operators.  For implementing your own custom format and parsing logic when your object is used with iostreams, continue.</p>\n\n<p>The stream operators, among the most commonly overloaded operators, are binary infix operators for which the syntax specifies no restriction on whether they should be members or non-members.\nSince they change their left argument (they alter the stream\u2019s state), they should, according to the rules of thumb, be implemented as members of their left operand\u2019s type. However, their left operands are streams from the standard library, and while most of the stream output and input operators defined by the standard library are indeed defined as members of the stream classes, when you implement output and input operations for your own types, you cannot change the standard library\u2019s stream types. That\u2019s why you need to implement these operators for your own types as non-member functions.\nThe canonical forms of the two are these:</p>\n\n<pre><code>std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const T&amp; obj)\n{\n  // write obj to stream\n\n  return os;\n}\n\nstd::istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(std::istream&amp; is, T&amp; obj)\n{\n  // read obj from stream\n\n  if( /* no valid object of T found in stream */ )\n    is.setstate(std::ios::failbit);\n\n  return is;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When implementing <code>operator&gt;&gt;</code>, manually setting the stream\u2019s state is only necessary when the reading itself succeeded, but the result is not what would be expected.</p>\n\n<h2>Function call operator</h2>\n\n<p>The function call operator, used to create function objects, also known as functors, must be defined as a <strong><em>member</em></strong> function, so it always has the implicit <code>this</code> argument of member functions. Other than this it can be overloaded to take any number of additional arguments, including zero.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the C++ standard library, function objects are always copied. Your own function objects should therefore be cheap to copy. If a function object absolutely needs to use data which is expensive to copy, it is better to store that data elsewhere and have the function object refer to it.</p>\n\n<h2>Comparison operators</h2>\n\n<p>The binary infix comparison operators should, according to the rules of thumb, be implemented as non-member functions<sup>1</sup>. The unary prefix negation <code>!</code> should (according to the same rules) be implemented as a member function. (but it is usually not a good idea to overload it.)</p>\n\n<p>The standard library\u2019s algorithms (e.g. <code>std::sort()</code>) and types (e.g. <code>std::map</code>) will always only expect <code>operator&lt;</code> to be present. However, the <em>users of your type will expect all the other operators to be present</em>, too, so if you define <code>operator&lt;</code>, be sure to follow the third fundamental rule of operator overloading and also define all the other boolean comparison operators. The canonical way to implement them is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>inline bool operator==(const X&amp; lhs, const X&amp; rhs){ /* do actual comparison */ }\ninline bool operator!=(const X&amp; lhs, const X&amp; rhs){return !operator==(lhs,rhs);}\ninline bool operator&lt; (const X&amp; lhs, const X&amp; rhs){ /* do actual comparison */ }\ninline bool operator&gt; (const X&amp; lhs, const X&amp; rhs){return  operator&lt; (rhs,lhs);}\ninline bool operator&lt;=(const X&amp; lhs, const X&amp; rhs){return !operator&gt; (lhs,rhs);}\ninline bool operator&gt;=(const X&amp; lhs, const X&amp; rhs){return !operator&lt; (lhs,rhs);}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The important thing to note here is that only two of these operators actually do anything, the others are just forwarding their arguments to either of these two to do the actual work.</p>\n\n<p>The syntax for overloading the remaining binary boolean operators (<code>||</code>, <code>&amp;&amp;</code>) follows the rules of the comparison operators. However, it is <em>very</em> unlikely that you would find a reasonable use case for these<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>As with all rules of thumb, sometimes there might be reasons to break this one, too. If so, do not forget that the left-hand operand of the binary comparison operators, which for member functions will be <code>*this</code>, needs to be <code>const</code>, too. So a comparison operator implemented as a member function would have to have this signature:</sub></p>\n\n<pre><code>bool operator&lt;(const X&amp; rhs) const { /* do actual comparison with *this */ }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><sub>(Note the <code>const</code> at the end.)</sub></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>It should be noted that the built-in version of <code>||</code> and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> use shortcut semantics. While the user defined ones (because they are syntactic sugar for method calls) do not use shortcut semantics. User will expect these operators to have shortcut semantics, and their code may depend on it, Therefore it is highly advised NEVER to define them.</sub></p>\n\n<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>\n\n<h3>Unary arithmetic operators</h3>\n\n<p>The unary increment and decrement operators come in both prefix and postfix flavor. To tell one from the other, the postfix variants take an additional dummy int argument. If you overload increment or decrement, be sure to always implement both prefix and postfix versions.\nHere is the canonical implementation of increment, decrement follows the same rules:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class X {\n  X&amp; operator++()\n  {\n    // do actual increment\n    return *this;\n  }\n  X operator++(int)\n  {\n    X tmp(*this);\n    operator++();\n    return tmp;\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the postfix variant is implemented in terms of prefix. Also note that postfix does an extra copy.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>Overloading unary minus and plus is not very common and probably best avoided. If needed, they should probably be overloaded as member functions. </p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>Also note that the postfix variant does more work and is therefore less efficient to use than the prefix variant. This is a good reason to generally prefer prefix increment over postfix increment. While compilers can usually optimize away the additional work of postfix increment for built-in types, they might not be able to do the same for user-defined types (which could be something as innocently looking as a list iterator). Once you got used to do <code>i++</code>, it becomes very hard to remember to do <code>++i</code> instead when <code>i</code> is not of a built-in type (plus you'd have to change code when changing a type), so it is better to make a habit of always using prefix increment, unless postfix is explicitly needed.</sub></p>\n\n<h3>Binary arithmetic operators</h3>\n\n<p>For the binary arithmetic operators, do not forget to obey the third basic rule operator overloading: If you provide <code>+</code>, also provide <code>+=</code>, if you provide <code>-</code>, do not omit <code>-=</code>, etc. Andrew Koenig is said to have been the first to observe that the compound assignment operators can be used as a base for their non-compound counterparts. That is, operator <code>+</code> is implemented in terms of <code>+=</code>, <code>-</code> is implemented in terms of <code>-=</code> etc.</p>\n\n<p>According to our rules of thumb, <code>+</code> and its companions should be non-members, while their compound assignment counterparts (<code>+=</code> etc.), changing their left argument, should be a member. Here is the exemplary code for <code>+=</code> and <code>+</code>, the other binary arithmetic operators should be implemented in the same way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class X {\n  X&amp; operator+=(const X&amp; rhs)\n  {\n    // actual addition of rhs to *this\n    return *this;\n  }\n};\ninline X operator+(X lhs, const X&amp; rhs)\n{\n  lhs += rhs;\n  return lhs;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>operator+=</code> returns its result per reference, while <code>operator+</code> returns a copy of its result. Of course, returning a reference is usually more efficient than returning a copy, but in the case of <code>operator+</code>, there is no way around the copying. When you write <code>a + b</code>, you expect the result to be a new value, which is why <code>operator+</code> has to return a new value.<sup>3</sup>\nAlso note that <code>operator+</code> takes its left operand <strong><em>by copy</em></strong> rather than by const reference. The reason for this is the same as the reason giving for <code>operator=</code> taking its argument per copy.</p>\n\n<p>The bit manipulation operators <code>~</code> <code>&amp;</code> <code>|</code> <code>^</code> <code>&lt;&lt;</code> <code>&gt;&gt;</code> should be implemented in the same way as the arithmetic operators. However, (except for overloading <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> for output and input) there are very few reasonable use cases for overloading these.</p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup> <sub>Again, the lesson to be taken from this is that <code>a += b</code> is, in general, more efficient than <code>a + b</code> and should be preferred if possible.</sub></p>\n\n<h2>Array Subscripting</h2>\n\n<p>The array subscript operator is a binary operator which must be implemented as a class member. It is used for container-like types that allow access to their data elements by a key.\nThe canonical form of providing these is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class X {\n        value_type&amp; operator[](index_type idx);\n  const value_type&amp; operator[](index_type idx) const;\n  // ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unless you do not want users of your class to be able to change data elements returned by <code>operator[]</code> (in which case you can omit the non-const variant), you should always provide both variants of the operator.</p>\n\n<p>If value_type is known to refer to a built-in type, the const variant of the operator should return a copy instead of a const reference.</p>\n\n<h2>Operators for Pointer-like Types</h2>\n\n<p>For defining your own iterators or smart pointers, you have to overload the unary prefix dereference operator <code>*</code> and the binary infix pointer member access operator <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class my_ptr {\n        value_type&amp; operator*();\n  const value_type&amp; operator*() const;\n        value_type* operator-&gt;();\n  const value_type* operator-&gt;() const;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that these, too, will almost always need both a const and a non-const version.\nFor the <code>-&gt;</code> operator, if <code>value_type</code> is of <code>class</code> (or <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>) type, another <code>operator-&gt;()</code> is called recursively, until an <code>operator-&gt;()</code> returns a value of non-class type.</p>\n\n<p>The unary address-of operator should never be overloaded.</p>\n\n<p>For <code>operator-&gt;*()</code> see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/8777845/140719\">this question</a>. It's rarely used and thus rarely ever overloaded. In fact, even iterators do not overload it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Continue to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/operator-overloading/16615725#16615725\">Conversion Operators</a></p>\n", "title": "Operator overloading", "answer_id": 4421719, "question_id": 4421706, "tags": ["c++", "operators", "operator-overloading", "c++-faq"]}, {"body": "<h2>The Decision between Member and Non-member</h2>\n\n<p>The binary operators <code>=</code> (assignment), <code>[]</code> (array subscription), <code>-&gt;</code> (member access), as well as the n-ary <code>()</code> (function call) operator, must always be implemented as <strong><em>member functions</em></strong>, because the syntax of the language requires them to. </p>\n\n<p>Other operators can be implemented either as members or as non-members. Some of them, however, usually have to be implemented as non-member functions, because their left operand cannot be modified by you.

I think that the semantics of overloading <strong><em><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7149461/\"><code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> deserve their own FAQ</a></em></strong>, within the topic of operator overloading I can never do it justice.</sup></p>\n\n<h2>Basics</h2>\n\n<p>In C++, when you write a <strong><em>new expression</em></strong> like <code>new T(arg)</code> two things happen when this expression is evaluated: First <strong><em><code>operator new</code></em></strong> is invoked to obtain raw memory, and then the appropriate constructor of <code>T</code> is invoked to turn this raw memory into a valid object. Likewise, when you delete an object, first its destructor is called, and then the memory is returned to <code>operator delete</code>.<br>\nC++ allows you to tune both of these operations: memory management and the construction/destruction of the object at the allocated memory. The latter is done by writing constructors and destructors for a class. Fine-tuning memory management is done by writing your own <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code>. </p>\n\n<p>The first of the basic rules of operator overloading \u2013 <em>don\u2019t do it</em> \u2013 applies especially to overloading <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>. Almost the only reasons to overload these operators are <strong><em>performance problems</em></strong> and <strong><em>memory constraints</em></strong>, and in many cases, other actions, like <em>changes to the algorithms</em> used, will provide a much <strong><em>higher cost/gain ratio</em></strong> than attempting to tweak memory management. </p>\n\n<p>The C++ standard library comes with a set of predefined <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> operators. The most important ones are these: </p>\n\n<pre><code>void* operator new(std::size_t) throw(std::bad_alloc); \nvoid  operator delete(void*) throw(); \nvoid* operator new[](std::size_t) throw(std::bad_alloc); \nvoid  operator delete[](void*) throw(); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first two allocate/deallocate memory for an object, the latter two for an array of objects. If you provide your own versions of these, they will <strong><em>not overload, but replace</em></strong> the ones from the standard library.<br>\nIf you overload <code>operator new</code>, you should always also overload the matching <code>operator delete</code>, even if you never intend to call it. The reason is that, if a constructor throws during the evaluation of a new expression, the run-time system will return the memory to the <code>operator delete</code> matching the <code>operator new</code> that was called to allocate the memory to create the object in. If you do not provide a matching <code>operator delete</code>, the default one is called, which is almost always wrong.<br>\nIf you overload <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>, you should consider overloading the array variants, too. </p>\n\n<h2>Placement <code>new</code></h2>\n\n<p>C++ allows new and delete operators to take additional arguments.<br>\nSo-called placement new allows you to create an object at a certain address which is passed to: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class X { /* ... */ };\nchar buffer[ sizeof(X) ];\nvoid f()\n{ \n  X* p = new(buffer) X(/*...*/);\n  // ... \n  p-&gt;~X(); // call destructor \n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The standard library comes with the appropriate overloads of the new and delete operators for this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>void* operator new(std::size_t,void* p) throw(std::bad_alloc); \nvoid  operator delete(void* p,void*) throw(); \nvoid* operator new[](std::size_t,void* p) throw(std::bad_alloc); \nvoid  operator delete[](void* p,void*) throw(); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that, in the example code for placement new given above, <code>operator delete</code> is never called, unless the constructor of X throws an exception. </p>\n\n<p>You can also overload <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> with other arguments. As with the additional argument for placement new, these arguments are also listed within parentheses after the keyword <code>new</code>. Merely for historical reasons, such variants are often also called placement new, even if their arguments are not for placing an object at a specific address. </p>\n\n<h2>Class-specific new and delete</h2>\n\n<p>Most commonly you will want to fine-tune memory management because measurement has shown that instances of a specific class, or of a group of related classes, are created and destroyed often and that the default memory management of the run-time system, tuned for general performance, deals inefficiently in this specific case. To improve this, you can overload new and delete for a specific class: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class my_class { \n  public: \n    // ... \n    void* operator new();\n    void  operator delete(void*,std::size_t);\n    void* operator new[](size_t);\n    void  operator delete[](void*,std::size_t);\n    // ... \n}; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Overloaded thus, new and delete behave like static member functions. For objects of <code>my_class</code>, the <code>std::size_t</code> argument will always be <code>sizeof(my_class)</code>. However, these operators are also called for dynamically allocated objects of <strong><em>derived classes</em></strong>, in which case it might be greater than that. </p>\n\n<h2>Global new and delete</h2>\n\n<p>To overload the global new and delete, simply replace the pre-defined operators of the standard library with our own. However, this is rarely ever needs to be done. </p>\n", "title": "Operator overloading", "answer_id": 4421791, "question_id": 4421706, "tags": ["c++", "operators", "operator-overloading", "c++-faq"]}, {"body": "<h1>Conversion Operators (also known as User Defined Conversions)</h1>\n\n<p>In C++ you can create conversion operators, operators that allow the compiler to convert between your types and other defined types.  There are two types of conversion operators, implicit and explicit ones.</p>\n\n<h2>Implicit Conversion Operators (C++98/C++03 and C++11)</h2>\n\n<p>An implicit conversion operator allows the compiler to implicitly convert (like the conversion between <code>int</code> and <code>long</code>) the value of a user-defined type to some other type.</p>\n\n<p>The following is a simple class with an implicit conversion operator:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class my_string {\npublic:\n  operator const char*() const {return data_;} // This is the conversion operator\nprivate:\n  const char* data_;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Implicit conversion operators, like one-argument constructors, are user-defined conversions. Compilers will grant one user-defined conversion when trying to match a call to an overloaded function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void f(const char*);\n\nmy_string str;\nf(str); // same as f( str.operator const char*() )\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At first this seems very helpful, but the problem with this is that the implicit conversion even kicks in when it isn\u2019t expected to. In the following code, <code>void f(const char*)</code> will be called because <code>my_string()</code> is not an <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3601602/what-are-rvalues-lvalues-xvalues-glvalues-and-prvalues\">lvalue</a>, so the first does not match:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void f(my_string&amp;);\nvoid f(const char*);\n\nf(my_string());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Beginners easily get this wrong and even experienced C++ programmers are sometimes surprised because the compiler picks an overload they didn\u2019t suspect.  These problems can be mitigated by explicit conversion operators.</p>\n\n<h2>Explicit Conversion Operators (C++11)</h2>\n\n<p>Unlike implicit conversion operators, explicit conversion operators will never kick in when you don't expect them to.  The following is a simple class with an explicit conversion operator:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class my_string {\npublic:\n  explicit operator const char*() const {return data_;}\nprivate:\n  const char* data_;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice the <code>explicit</code>.  Now when you try to execute the unexpected code from the implicit conversion operators, you get a compiler error:</p>\n\n<pre>\nprog.cpp: In function \u2018int main()\u2019:\nprog.cpp:15:18: error: no matching function for call to \u2018f(my_string)\u2019\nprog.cpp:15:18: note: candidates are:\nprog.cpp:11:10: note: void f(my_string&)\nprog.cpp:11:10: note:   no known conversion for argument 1 from \u2018my_string\u2019 to \u2018my_string&\u2019\nprog.cpp:12:10: note: void f(const char*)\nprog.cpp:12:10: note:   no known conversion for argument 1 from \u2018my_string\u2019 to \u2018const char*\u2019\n</pre>\n\n<p>To invoke the explicit cast operator, you have to use <code>static_cast</code>, a C-style cast, or a constructor style cast ( i.e. <code>T(value)</code> ).  </p>\n\n<p>However, there is one exception to this:  The compiler is allowed to implicitly convert to <code>bool</code>.  In addition, the compiler is not allowed to do another implicit conversion after it converts to <code>bool</code> (a compiler is allowed to do 2 implicit conversions at a time, but only 1 user-defined conversion at max).  </p>\n\n<p>Because the compiler will not cast \"past\" <code>bool</code>, explicit conversion operators now remove the need for the <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/More_C%2B%2B_Idioms/Safe_bool\">Safe Bool idiom</a>.   For example, smart pointers before C++11 used the Safe Bool idiom to prevent conversions to integral types.  In C++11, the smart pointers use an explicit operator instead because the compiler is not allowed to implicitly convert to an integral type after it explicitly converted a type to bool.</p>\n\n<p>Continue to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4421706/operator-overloading-in-c/4421791#4421791\">Overloading <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code></a>.</p>\n", "title": "Operator overloading", "answer_id": 16615725, "question_id": 4421706, "tags": ["c++", "operators", "operator-overloading", "c++-faq"]}, {"body": "<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34953523/overloading-the-insertion-operator-questions-theoretical\">Why can't <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> function for streaming objects to <code>std::cout</code> or to a file be a member function?</a></p>\n\n<p>Let's say you have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct Foo\n{\n   int a;\n   double b;\n\n   std::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; out) const\n   {\n      return out &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; \" \" &lt;&lt; b;\n   }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Given that, you cannot use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Foo f = {10, 20.0};\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; f;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code> is overloaded as a member function of <code>Foo</code>, the LHS of the operator must be a <code>Foo</code> object.

This may cause <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>s whenever you concurrently send large POST requests (e.g. uploading files). To avoid this, you would like to set the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html#setFixedLengthStreamingMode%28int%29\"><code>HttpURLConnection#setFixedLengthStreamingMode()</code></a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>httpConnection.setFixedLengthStreamingMode(contentLength);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But if the content length is really not known beforehand, then you can make use of chunked streaming mode by setting the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html#setChunkedStreamingMode%28int%29\"><code>HttpURLConnection#setChunkedStreamingMode()</code></a> accordingly. This will set the HTTP <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.41\"><code>Transfer-Encoding</code></a> header to <code>chunked</code> which will force the request body being sent in chunks.

The <code>URLConnection</code> will by default set it to <code>Java/1.6.0_19</code> where the last part is obviously the JRE version.

The <code>HttpURLConnection</code> implementation is in older JREs somewhat buggy with keeping connections alive. You may want to turn it off by setting the <code>http.keepAlive</code> system property to <code>false</code>. You can do this programmatically in the beginning of your application by:</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.setProperty(\"http.keepAlive\", \"false\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Uploading files</h3>\n\n<p>You'd normally use <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.2\"><code>multipart/form-data</code></a> encoding for mixed POST content (binary and character data). The encoding is in more detail described in <a href=\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2388.html\">RFC2388</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>String param = \"value\";\nFile textFile = new File(\"/path/to/file.txt\");\nFile binaryFile = new File(\"/path/to/file.bin\");\nString boundary = Long.toHexString(System.currentTimeMillis()); // Just generate some unique random value.\nString CRLF = \"\\r\\n\"; // Line separator required by multipart/form-data.\nURLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();\nconnection.setDoOutput(true);\nconnection.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Type\", \"multipart/form-data; boundary=\" + boundary);\n\ntry (\n    OutputStream output = connection.getOutputStream();\n    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, charset), true);\n) {\n    // Send normal param.\n    writer.append(\"--\" + boundary).append(CRLF);\n    writer.append(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"param\\\"\").append(CRLF);\n    writer.append(\"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\" + charset).append(CRLF);\n    writer.append(CRLF).append(param).append(CRLF).flush();\n\n    // Send text file.\n    writer.append(\"--\" + boundary).append(CRLF);\n    writer.append(\"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"textFile\\\"; filename=\\\"\" + textFile.getName() + \"\\\"\").append(CRLF);\n    writer.append(\"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\" + charset).append(CRLF); // Text file itself must be saved in this charset!\n    writer.append(CRLF).flush();\n    Files.copy(textFile.toPath(), output);\n    output.flush(); // Important before continuing with writer!\n    writer.append(CRLF).flush(); // CRLF is important!

The <code>getPart()</code> method is however relatively new, it's introduced in Servlet 3.0 (Glassfish 3, Tomcat 7, etc). Prior to Servlet 3.0, your best choice is using <a href=\"http://commons.apache.org/fileupload\">Apache Commons FileUpload</a> to parse a <code>multipart/form-data</code> request. Also see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2422468/upload-big-file-to-servlet/2424824#2424824\">this answer</a> for examples of both the FileUpload and the Servelt 3.0 approaches.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Dealing with untrusted or misconfigured HTTPS sites</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes you need to connect a HTTPS URL, perhaps because you're writing a web scraper. In that case, you may likely face a <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Not trusted server certificate</code> on some HTTPS sites who doesn't keep their SSL certificates up to date, or a <code>java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative DNS name matching [hostname] found</code> or <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: handshake alert: unrecognized_name</code> on some misconfigured HTTPS sites.</p>\n\n<p>The following one-time-run <code>static</code> initializer in your web scraper class should make <code>HttpsURLConnection</code> more lenient as to those HTTPS sites and thus not throw those exceptions anymore.</p>\n\n<pre><code>static {\n    TrustManager[] trustAllCertificates = new TrustManager[] {\n        new X509TrustManager() {\n            @Override\n            public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {\n                return null; // Not relevant.\n            }\n            @Override\n            public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {\n                // Do nothing.

operator=(const person&amp; that)\n{\n    char* local_name = new char[strlen(that.name) + 1];\n    // If the above statement throws,\n    // the object is still in the same state as before.\n    // None of the following statements will throw an exception :)\n    strcpy(local_name, that.name);\n    delete[] name;\n    name = local_name;\n    age = that.age;\n    return *this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This also takes care of self-assignment without an explicit check.\nAn even more robust solution to this problem is the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/\">copy-and-swap idiom</a>,\nbut I will not go into the details of exception safety here.\nI only mentioned exceptions to make the following point: <strong>Writing classes that manage resources is hard.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Noncopyable resources</h2>\n\n<p>Some resources cannot or should not be copied, such as file handles or mutexes.\nIn that case, simply declare the copy constructor and copy assignment operator as <code>private</code> without giving a definition:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private:\n\n    person(const person&amp;

So let's say we have a class of Car as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Car //A very simple class just to demonstrate what these definitions mean.\n//It's pseudocode C++/Javaish, I assume strings do not need to be allocated.\n{\nprivate String sPrintColor;\nprivate String sModel;\nprivate String sMake;\n\npublic changePaint(String newColor)\n{\n   this.sPrintColor = newColor;\n}\n\npublic Car(String model, String make, String color) //Constructor\n{\n   this.sPrintColor = color;\n   this.sModel = model;\n   this.sMake = make;\n}\n\npublic ~Car() //Destructor\n{\n//Because we did not create any custom types, we aren't adding more code.\n//Anytime your object goes out of scope / program collects garbage / etc. this guy gets called + all other related destructors.\n//Since we did not use anything but strings, we have nothing additional to handle.\n//The assumption is being made that the 3 strings will be handled by string's destructor and that it is being called automatically--if this were not the case you would need to do it here.\n}\n\npublic Car(const Car &amp;other) // Copy Constructor\n{\n   this.sPrintColor = other.sPrintColor;\n   this.sModel = other.sModel;\n   this.sMake = other.sMake;\n}\npublic Car &amp;operator =(const Car &amp;other) // Assignment Operator\n{\n   if(this != &amp;other)\n   {\n      this.sPrintColor = other.sPrintColor;\n      this.sModel = other.sModel;\n      this.sMake = other.sMake;\n   }\n   return *this;\n}\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A deep copy is if we declare an object and then create a completely separate copy of the object...we end up with 2 objects in 2 completely sets of memory.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Car car1 = new Car(\"mustang\", \"ford\", \"red\");\nCar car2 = car1; //Call the copy constructor\ncar2.changePaint(\"green\");\n//car2 is now green but car1 is still red.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let's do something strange.  Let's say car2 is either programmed wrong or purposely meant to share the actual memory that car1 is made of.  (It's usually a mistake to do this and in classes is usually the blanket it's discussed under.)  Pretend that anytime you ask about car2, you're really resolving a pointer to car1's memory space...that's more or less what a shallow copy is.</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Shallow copy example\n//Assume we're in C++ because it's standard behavior is to shallow copy objects if you do not have a constructor written for an operation.\n//Now let's assume I do not have any code for the assignment or copy operations like I do above...with those now gone, C++ will use the default.\n\n Car car1 = new Car(\"ford\", \"mustang\", \"red\"); \n Car car2 = car1; \n car2.changePaint(\"green\");//car1 is also now green \n delete car2;/*I get rid of my car which is also really your car...I told C++ to resolve \n the address of where car2 exists and delete the memory...which is also\n the memory associated with your car.*/\n car1.changePaint(\"red\");/*program will likely crash because this area is\n no longer allocated to the program.*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So regardless of what language you're writing in, be very careful about what you mean when it comes to copying objects because most of the time you want a deep copy.</p>\n\n<p>What are the copy constructor and the copy assignment operator?\nI have already used them above.  The copy constructor is called when you type code such as <code>Car car2 = car1;</code>  Essentially if you declare a variable and assign it in one line, that's when the copy constructor is called.  The assignment operator is what happens when you use an equal sign--<code>car2 = car1;</code>.  Notice <code>car2</code> isn't declared in the same statement.  The two chunks of code you write for these operations are likely very similar.  In fact the typical design pattern has another function you call to set everything once you're satisfied the initial copy/assignment is legitimate--if you look at the longhand code I wrote, the functions are nearly identical.</p>\n\n<p>When do I need to declare them myself? \nIf you are not writing code that is to be shared or for production in some manner, you really only need to declare them when you need them.  You do need to be aware of what your program language does if you choose to use it 'by accident' and didn't make one--i.e. you get the compiler default.  I rarely use copy constructors for instance, but assignment operator overrides are very common.  Did you know you can override what addition, subtraction, etc. mean as well?</p>\n\n<p>How can I prevent my objects from being copied?\nOverride all of the ways you're allowed to allocate memory for your object with a private function is a reasonable start.  If you really don't want people copying them, you could make it public and alert the programmer by throwing an exception and also not copying the object.  </p>\n", "title": "What is The Rule of Three?", "answer_id": 12939100, "question_id": 4172722, "tags": ["c++", "copy-constructor", "assignment-operator", "c++-faq", "rule-of-three"]}, {"body": "<p>Basically if you have a destructor (not the default destructor) it means that the class that you defined has some memory allocation.

I'm leaving now; call me back when you are ready to cooperate.</em></p>\n\n<p>Computer programming may not be a <em>licensed</em> profession, but people often seem to wonder why our profession doesn't get the same respect as a civil or mechanical engineer - well, look no further.  Those professions, when handed garbage (or outright dangerous) requirements, will simply refuse.  They know it is not an excuse to say, \"well, I did my best, but he insisted, and I've gotta do what he says.\"  They could lose their license for that excuse.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know whether or not you or your clients are part of any publicly-traded company, but storing passwords in any recoverable form would cause you to to fail several different types of security audits.  The issue is not how difficult it would be for some \"hacker\" who got access to your database to recover the passwords.  <strong>The vast majority of security threats are internal.</strong>  What you need to protect against is some disgruntled employee walking off with all the passwords and selling them to the highest bidder.  Using asymmetrical encryption and storing the private key in a separate database does absolutely nothing to prevent this scenario; there's always going to be <em>someone</em> with access to the private database, and that's a serious security risk.</p>\n\n<p><strong>There is no ethical or responsible way to store passwords in a recoverable form.

My initial reaction was very similar to @Michael Brooks, till I realized, like @stefanw, that the issue here is broken requirements, but these are what they are.<br>\nBut then, it occured to me that that might not even be the case! The missing point here, is the unspoken <em>value</em> of the application's assets. Simply speaking, for a low value system, a fully secure authentication mechanism, with all the process involved, would be overkill, and the <strong>wrong</strong> security choice.<br>\nObviously, for a bank, the \"best practices\" are a must, and there is no way to ethically violate CWE-257. But it's easy to think of low value systems where it's just not worth it (but a simple password is still required).   </p>\n\n<p><strong>It's important to remember, true security expertise is in finding appropriate tradeoffs, NOT in dogmatically spouting the \"Best Practices\" that anyone can read online.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As such, I suggest another solution:<br>\nDepending on the value of the system, and <strong>ONLY IF</strong> the system is appropriately low-value with no \"expensive\" asset (the identity itself, included), <strong>AND</strong> there are valid business requirements that make proper process impossible (or sufficiently difficult/expensive), <strong>AND</strong> the client is made aware of all the caveats...<br>\nThen it could be appropriate to simply allow reversible encryption, with no special hoops to jump through.<br>\nI am stopping just short of saying not to bother with encryption at all, because it is very simple/cheap to implement (even considering passible key management), and it DOES provide SOME protection (more than the cost of implementing it). Also, its worth looking at how to provide the user with the original password, whether via email, displaying on the screen, etc.<br>\nSince the assumption here is that the value of the stolen password (even in aggregate) is quite low, any of these solutions can be valid.   </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Since there is a lively discussion going on, actually SEVERAL lively discussions, in the different posts and seperate comment threads, I will add some clarifications, and respond to some of the very good points that have been raised elsewhere here.</p>\n\n<p>To start, I think it's clear to everyone here that allowing the user's original password to be retrieved, is Bad Practice, and generally Not A Good Idea. That is not at all under dispute...<br>\nFurther, I will emphasize that in many, nay MOST, situations - it's really wrong, even <a href=\"http://www.fthe.net/blog/?p=28\">foul, nasty, AND ugly</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>However, the crux of the question is around <em>the principle</em>, <strong>IS there any situation where it might not be necessary</strong> to forbid this, and if so, how to do so in the <strong>most correct manner appropriate to the situation</strong>.   </p>\n\n<p>Now, as @Thomas, @sfussenegger and few others mentioned, the only proper way to answer that question, is to do a thorough <em>risk analysis</em> of any given (or hypothetical) situation, to understand what's at stake, how much it's worth to protect, and what other mitigations are in play to afford that protection.<br>\nNo, it is NOT a buzzword, this is one of the basic, most important tools for a real-live security professional. Best practices are good up to a point (usually as guidelines for the inexperienced and the hacks), after that point thoughtful risk analysis takes over.  </p>\n\n<p>Y'know, it's funny - I always considered myself one of the security fanatics, and somehow I'm on the opposite side of those so-called \"Security Experts\"... Well, truth is - because I'm a fanatic, and an actual real-life security expert - I do not believe in spouting \"Best Practice\" dogma (or CWEs) WITHOUT that all-important <em>risk analysis</em>.<br>\n\"Beware the security zealot who is quick to apply everything in their tool belt without knowing what the actual issue is they are defending against.  More security doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to good security.\"<br>\nRisk analysis, and true security fanatics, would point to a smarter, value/risk -based tradeoff, based on risk, potential loss, possible threats, complementary mitigations, etc. Any \"Security Expert\" that cannot point to sound risk analysis as the basis for their recommendations, or support logical tradeoffs, but would instead prefer to spout dogma and CWEs without even understanding how to perform a risk analysis, are naught but Security Hacks, and their Expertise is not worth the toilet paper they printed it on.  </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, that is how we get the ridiculousness that is Airport Security.  </p>\n\n<p>But before we talk about the appropriate tradeoffs to make in THIS SITUATION, let's take a look at the apparent risks (apparent, because we don't have all the background information on this situation, we are all hypothesizing - since the question is what hypothetical situation might there be...)<br>\nLet's assume a LOW-VALUE system, yet not so trival that it's public access - the system owner wants to prevent casual impersonation, yet \"high\" security is not as paramount as ease of use. (Yes, it is a legitimate tradeoff to ACCEPT the risk that any proficient script-kiddie can hack the site... Wait, isn't APT in vogue now...?)<br>\nJust for example, let's say I'm arranging a simple site for a large family gathering, allowing everyone to brainstorm on where we want to go on our camping trip this year. I'm less worried about some anonymous hacker, or even Cousin Fred squeezing in repeated suggestions to go back to Lake Wantanamanabikiliki, as I am about Aunt Erma not being able to logon when she needs to. Now, Aunt Erma, being a nuclear physicist, isn't very good at remembering passwords, or even with using computers at all... So I want to remove all friction possible for her. Again, I'm NOT worried about hacks, I just dont want silly mistakes of wrong login - I want to know who is coming, and what they want.   </p>\n\n<p>Anyway.<br>\nSo what are our main risks here, if we symmetrically encrypt passwords, instead of using a one-way hash?   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Impersonating users? No, I've already accepted that risk, not interesting.</li>\n<li>Evil administrator? Well, maybe... But again, I dont care if someone can impersonate another user, INTERNAL or no... and anyway a malicious admin is gonna get your password <strong>no matter what</strong> - if your admin's gone bad, its game over anyway.</li>\n<li>Another issue that's been raised, is the identity is actually shared between several systems. Ah! This is a very interesting risk, that requires a closer look.<br>\nLet me start by asserting that it's not the actual <em>identity</em> thats shared, rather the <em>proof</em>, or the authentication credential. Okay, since a shared password will effectively allow me entrance to another system (say, my bank account, or gmail), this is effectively the same identity, so it's just semantics... Except that <em>it's not</em>. Identity is managed seperately by each system, in this scenario (though there might be third party id systems, such as OAuth - still, its seperate from the identity in this system - more on this later).<br>\nAs such, the core point of risk here, is that the user will willingly input his (same) password into several different systems - and now, I (the admin) or any other hacker of my site will have access to Aunt Erma's passwords for the nuclear missile site.   </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hmmm.</p>\n\n<p>Does anything here seem off to you?  </p>\n\n<p>It should.</p>\n\n<p>Let's start with the fact that protecting the nuclear missiles system is <strong>not my responsibility</strong>, I'm just building a frakkin family outing site (for MY family). So whose responsibility IS it? Umm... How about the nuclear missiles system? Duh.<br>\nSecond, If I wanted to steal someone's password (someone who is known to repeatedly use the same password between secure sites, and not-so-secure ones) - why would I bother hacking your site? Or struggling with your symmetric encryption? Goshdarnitall, I can just put up <a href=\"http://xkcd.com/792/\">my own simple website</a>, have users sign up to receive VERY IMPORTANT NEWS about whatever they want... Puffo Presto, I \"stole\" their passwords.  </p>\n\n<p>Yes, user education always does come back to bite us in the hienie, doesn't it?<br>\nAnd there's nothing you can do about that... Even if you WERE to hash their passwords on your site, and do everything else the TSA can think of, you added protection to their password <em>NOT ONE WHIT</em>, if they're going to keep promiscuously sticking their passwords into every site they bump into. Don't EVEN bother trying.   </p>\n\n<p>Put another way, <strong><em>You don't own their passwords</em></strong>, so stop trying to act like you do.  </p>\n\n<p>So, my Dear Security Experts, as an old lady used to ask for Wendy's, \"WHERE's the risk?\"  </p>\n\n<p>Another few points, in answer to some issues raised above:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CWE is not a law, or regulation, or even a standard. It is a collection of <em>common weaknesses</em>, i.e. the inverse of \"Best Practices\".</li>\n<li>The issue of shared identity is an actual problem, but misunderstood (or misrepresented) by the naysayers here. It is an issue of sharing the identity in and of itself(!), NOT about cracking the passwords on low-value systems. If you're sharing a password between a low-value and a high-value system, the problem is already there! </li>\n<li>By the by, the previous point would actually point <strong>AGAINST</strong> using OAuth and the like for both these low-value systems, and the high-value banking systems.</li>\n<li>I know it was just an example, but (sadly) the FBI systems are not really the most secured around. Not quite like your cat's blog's servers, but nor do they surpass some of the more secure banks. </li>\n<li>Split knowledge, or dual control, of encryption keys do NOT happen just in the military, in fact PCI-DSS now <strong>requires</strong> this from basically all merchants, so its not really so far out there anymore (IF the value justifies it).</li>\n<li>To all those who are complaining that questions like these are what makes the developer profession look so bad: it is answers like those, that make the security profession look even worse. Again, business-focused risk analysis is what is required, otherwise you make yourself useless. In addition to being wrong.</li>\n<li>I guess this is why it's not a good idea to just take a regular developer and drop more security responsibilities on him, without training to think differently, and to look for the correct tradeoffs. No offense, to those of you here, I'm all for it - but more training is in order.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Whew. What a long post...<br>\nBut to answer your original question, @Shane:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Explain to the customer the proper way to do things.</li>\n<li>If he still insists, explain some more, insist, argue. Throw a tantrum, if needed.</li>\n<li>Explain the BUSINESS RISK to him. Details are good, figures are better, a live demo is usually best.</li>\n<li>IF HE STILL insists, AND presents valid business reasons - it's time for you to do a judgement call:<br>\nIs this site low-to-no-value? Is it really a valid business case? Is it good enough for you? Are there no other risks you can consider, that would outweigh valid business reasons? (And of course, is the client NOT a malicious site, but thats duh).<br>\nIf so, just go right ahead. It's not worth the effort, friction, and lost usage (in this hypothetical situation) to put the necessary process in place. Any other decision (again, in this situation) is a bad tradeoff.   </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, bottom line, and an actual answer - encrypt it with a simple symmetrical algorithm, protect the encryption key with strong ACLs and preferably DPAPI or the like, document it and have the client (someone senior enough to make that decision) sign off on it.</p>\n", "title": "How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?", "answer_id": 2319090, "question_id": 2283937, "tags": ["security", "password-encryption", "password-storage"]}, {"body": "<p>You can not ethically store passwords for later plaintext retrieval. It's as simple as that. Even Jon Skeet can not ethically store passwords for later plaintext retrieval.

And that's not just one user's password being compromised, but <strong>all of them.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your clients have a problem with that, tell them that storing passwords recoverably is against the law. Here in the UK at any rate, the Data Protection Act 1998 (in particular, Schedule 1, Part II, Paragraph 9) requires data controllers to use the appropriate technical measures to keep personal data secure, taking into account, among other things, the harm that might be caused if the data were compromised -- which might be considerable for users who share passwords among sites.

If what they really want is a password to logon, why not have a routine that simply changes the old password (whatever it is) to a new password that the support person can give to the person that lost his password?</p>\n\n<p>I have worked with systems that do exactly this. The support person has no way of knowing what the current password is, but can reset it to a new value. Of course all such resets should be logged somewhere and good practice would be to generate an email to the user telling him that the password has been reset.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is to have two simultaneous passwords permitting access to an account. One is the \"normal\" password that the user manages and the other is like a skeleton/master key that is known by the support staff only and is the same for all users. That way when a user has a problem the support person can login to the account with the master key and help the user change his password to whatever. Needless to say, all logins with the master key should be logged by the system as well. As an extra measure, whenever the master key is used you could validate the support persons credentials as well.</p>\n\n<p>-EDIT- In response to the comments about not having a master key: I agree that it is bad just as I believe it is bad to allow anyone other than the user to have access to the user's account. If you look at the question, the whole premise is that the customer mandated a highly compromised security environment.</p>\n\n<p>A master key need not be as bad as would first seem. I used to work at a defense plant where they perceived the need for the mainframe computer operator to have \"special access\" on certain occasions. They simply put the special password in a sealed envelope and taped it to the operator's desk. To use the password (which the operator did not know) he had to open the envelope. At each change of shift one of the jobs of the shift supervisor was to see if the envelope had been opened and if so immediately have the password changed (by another department) and the new password was put in a new envelope and the process started all over again. The operator would be questioned as to why he had opened it and the incident would be documented for the record.</p>\n\n<p>While this is not a procedure that I would design, it did work and provided for excellent accountability. Everything was logged and reviewed, plus all the operators had DOD secret clearances and we never had any abuses.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the review and oversight, all the operators knew that if they misused the privilege of opening the envelope they were subject to immediate dismissal and possible criminal prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>So I guess the real answer is if one wants to do things right one hires people they can trust, do background checks and exercise proper management oversight and accountability.</p>\n\n<p>But then again if this poor fellow's client had good management they wouldn't have asked for such a security comprimised solution in the first place, now would they?</p>\n", "title": "How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?", "answer_id": 2330392, "question_id": 2283937, "tags": ["security", "password-encryption", "password-storage"]}, {"body": "<p>open a DB on a standalone server and give an encrypted remote connection to each web server that requires this feature.<br>\nit does not have to be a relational DB, it can be a file system with FTP access, using folders and files instead of tables and rows.<br>\ngive the web servers write-only permissions if you can.</p>\n\n<p>Store the non-retrievable encryption of the password in the site's DB (let's call it \"pass-a\") like normal people do :)<br>\non each new user (or password change) store a plain copy of the password in the remote DB. use the server's id,  the user's ID and \"pass-a\" as a composite key for this password. you can even use a bi-directional encryption on the password to sleep better at night.</p>\n\n<p>now in order for someone to get both the password and it's context (site id + user id + \"pass-a\"), he has to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>hack the website's DB to get a (\"pass-a\", user id ) pair or pairs.</li>\n<li>get the website's id from some config file</li>\n<li>find and hack into the remote passwords DB.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>you can control the accessibility of the password retrieval service (expose it only as a secured web service, allow only certain amount of passwords retrievals per day, do it manually, etc.), and even charge extra for this \"special security arrangement\".<br>\nThe passwords retrieval DB server is pretty hidden as it does not serve many functions and can be better secured (you can tailor permissions, processes and services tightly).</p>\n\n<p>all in all, you make the work harder for the hacker. the chance of a security breach on any single server is still the same, but meaningful data (a match of account and password) will be hard to assemble.</p>\n", "title": "How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?", "answer_id": 2330576, "question_id": 2283937, "tags": ["security", "password-encryption", "password-storage"]}, {"body": "<p>After reading this part:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a note below I made the point that\n  websites geared largely toward the\n  elderly, mentally challenged, or very\n  young can become confusing for people\n  when they are asked to perform a\n  secure password recovery routine.\n  Though we may find it simple and\n  mundane in those cases some users need\n  the extra assistance of either having\n  a service tech help them into the\n  system or having it emailed/displayed\n  directly to them.</p>\n  \n  <p>In such systems the attrition rate\n  from these demographics could hobble\n  the application if users were not\n  given this level of access assistance,\n  so please answer with such a setup in\n  mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm left wondering if any of these requirements mandate a retrievable password system.

So far, I've not seen <em>one legitimate benefit</em> mentioned for having a recoverable password stored on the system. Consider this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Does the user benefit from having their password emailed to them?  No.  They receive more benefit from a one-time-use password reset link, which would hopefully allow them to choose a password they <em>will</em> remember.</li>\n<li>Does the user benefit from having their password displayed on screen?  No, for the same reason as above; they should choose a new password.</li>\n<li>Does the user benefit from having a support person speak the password to the user?  No; again, if the support person deems the user's request for their password as properly authenticated, it's more to the user's benefit to be given a new password and the opportunity to change it.  Plus, phone support is more costly than automated password resets, so the company also doesn't benefit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It seems the only ones that can benefit from recoverable passwords are those with malicious intent or supporters of poor APIs that require third-party password exchange (please don't use said APIs ever!).  Perhaps you can win your argument by truthfully stating to your clients that <strong>the company gains no benefits and only liabilities by storing recoverable passwords</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Reading between the lines of these types of requests, you'll see that your clients probably don't understand or actually even care at all about how passwords are managed.  What they really want is an <em>authentication system</em> that isn't so hard for their users.  So in addition to telling them how they don't actually want recoverable passwords, you should offer them ways to make the authentication process less painful, especially if you don't need the heavy security levels of, say, a bank:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Allow the user to use their email address for their user name.  I've seen countless cases where the user forgets their user name, but few forget their email address.</li>\n<li>Offer OpenID and let a third-party pay for the costs of user forgetfulness.</li>\n<li>Ease off on the password restrictions.  I'm sure we've all been incredibly annoyed when some web site doesn't allow your preferred password because of useless requirements like \"you can't use special characters\" or \"your password is too long\" or \"your password must start with a letter.\"  Also, if ease of use is a larger concern than password strength, you could loosen even the non-stupid requirements by allowing shorter passwords or not requiring a mix of character classes.  With loosened restrictions, users will be more likely to use a password they won't forget.</li>\n<li>Don't expire passwords.</li>\n<li>Allow the user to reuse an old password.</li>\n<li>Allow the user to choose their own password reset question.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But if you, for some reason (and please tell us the reason) <em>really, really, really</em> need to be able to have a recoverable password, you could shield the user from potentially compromising their other online accounts by giving them a non-password-based authentication system.  Because people are already familiar with username/password systems and they are a well-exercised solution, this would be a last resort, but there's surely plenty of creative alternatives to passwords:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Let the user choose a numeric pin, preferably not 4-digit, and preferably only if brute-force attempts are protected against.</li>\n<li>Have the user choose a question with a short answer that only they know the answer to, will never change, they will always remember, and they don't mind other people finding out.</li>\n<li>Have the user enter a user name and then draw an easy-to-remember shape with sufficient permutations to protect against guessing (see <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/iblee/2966821048/\">this nifty photo</a> of how the G1 does this for unlocking the phone).</li>\n<li>For a children's web site, you could auto-generate a fuzzy creature based on the user name (sort of like an identicon) and ask the user to give the creature a secret name.

Plaintext passwords are far less secure but are cheaper to implement (but should be avoided). At end of the day, it comes down to a cost/benefit analysis of a breach.

A professional provides options to their customers and, when it comes to security, lays out the advantages and risks of any implementation. This is doubly so if the client requests something that could put them at risk because of failing to heed industry standards. If a client specifically requests two-way encryption, I would ensure you document your objections but that should not stop you from implementing in the best way you know.

Ask why the password is required to be in plaintext:  if it's so that the user can retrieve the password, then strictly speaking you don't really need to retrieve the password they set (they don't remember what it is anyway), you need to be able to give them a password they <em>can use</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Think about it:  if the user needs to retrieve the password, it's because they've forgotten it. In which case a new password is just as good as the old one. But, one of the drawbacks of common password reset mechanisms used today is that the generated passwords produced in a reset operation are generally a bunch of random characters, so they're difficult for the user to simply type in correctly unless they copy-n-paste. That can be a problem for less savvy computer users.</p>\n\n<p>One way around that problem is to provide auto-generated passwords that are more or less natural language text.  While natural language strings might not have the entropy that a string of random characters of the same length has, there's nothing that says your auto-generated password needs to have only 8 (or 10 or 12) characters.  Get a high-entropy auto-generated passphrase by stringing together several random words (leave a space between them, so they're still recognizable and typeable by anyone who can read). Six random words of varying length are probably easier to type correctly and with confidence than 10 random characters, and they can have a higher entropy as well.  For example, the entropy of a 10 character password drawn randomly from uppercase, lowercase, digits and 10 punctuation symbols (for a total of 72 valid symbols) would have an entropy of 61.7 bits.  Using a dictionary of 7776 words (as Diceware uses) which could be randomly selected for a six word passphrase, the passphrase would have an entropy of 77.4 bits. See the <a href=\"http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarefaq.html#calculatingentropy\">Diceware FAQ</a> for more info.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>a passphrase with about 77 bits of entropy: \"admit prose flare table acute flair\"</p></li>\n<li><p>a password with about 74 bits of entropy:   \"K:&amp;$R^tt~qkD\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I know I'd prefer typing the phrase, and with copy-n-paste, the phrase is no less easy to use that the password either, so no loss there. Of course if your website (or whatever the protected asset is) doesn't need 77 bits of entropy for an auto-generated passphrase, generate fewer words (which I'm sure your users would appreciate).</p>\n\n<p>I understand the arguments that there are password protected assets that really don't have a high level of value, so the breach of a password might not be the end of the world. For example, I probably wouldn't care if 80% of the passwords I use on various websites was breached:  all that could happen is a someone spamming or posting under my name for a while.  That wouldn't be great, but it's not like they'd be breaking into my bank account. However, given the fact that many people use the same password for their web forum sites as they do for their bank accounts (and probably national security databases), I think it would be best to handle even those 'low-value' passwords as non-recoverable.</p>\n", "title": "How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?", "answer_id": 2350498, "question_id": 2283937, "tags": ["security", "password-encryption", "password-storage"]}, {"body": "<p>If you can't just reject the requirement to store recoverable passwords, how about this as your counter-argument.</p>\n\n<p>We can either properly hash passwords and build a reset mechanism for the users, or we can remove all personally identifiable information from the system.

Before complains of a commercial plug appear, what I'm saying is that we can lower the risks inherent of keeping passwords easily retrievable or resettable when they aren't the only factor used to authenticate an user. I concede that for the password reuse among sites scenarios the situation is still not pretty, as the user will insist to have the original password because he/she wants to open up the other sites too, but you can try to deliver the reconstructed password in the safest possible way (htpps and discreet appearance on the html).  </p>\n", "title": "How should I ethically approach user password storage for later plaintext retrieval?", "answer_id": 3925151, "question_id": 2283937, "tags": ["security", "password-encryption", "password-storage"]}, {"body": "<p>I have the same issue.

To prevent bash to try to develop <code>!\"</code>, you could:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a+=(one word \"hello world\"! 'hello world!' $'hello world\\041')\n\ndeclare -p a\ndeclare -a a='([0]=\"36\" [1]=\"18\" [2]=\"one\" [3]=\"word\" [4]=\"hello world!\" [5]=\"h\nello world!\" [6]=\"hello world!\")'\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2><code>printf</code>: Re-construct variable using the <em>builtin</em> command</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>printf</code> <em>builtin</em> command gives a powerful way of drawing string format. As this is a Bash <em>builtin</em>, there is a option for sending formated string to a variable instead of printing on <code>stdout</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>echo ${a[@]}\n36 18 one word hello world! hello world! hello world!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are seven <em>strings</em> in this array. So we could build a formated string containing exactly seven positional arguments:</p>\n\n<pre><code>printf -v a \"%s./.%s...'%s' '%s', '%s'=='%s'=='%s'\" \"${a[@]}\"\necho $a\n36./.18...'one' 'word', 'hello world!'=='hello world!'=='hello world!'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or we could use <em>one argument format string</em> wich will be repeated as many argument submited...</p>\n\n<p>Note that our <code>a</code> is still an array! Only first element is changed!</p>\n\n<pre><code>declare -p a\ndeclare -a a='([0]=\"36./.18...'\\''one'\\'' '\\''word'\\'', '\\''hello world!'\\''=='\\\n''hello world!'\\''=='\\''hello world!'\\''\" [1]=\"18\" [2]=\"one\" [3]=\"word\" [4]=\"hel\nlo world!\" [5]=\"hello world!\" [6]=\"hello world!\")'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Under bash, when you access a variable name without specifying index, you always address first element only!</p>\n\n<p>So to retrieve our seven field array, we only need to re-set 1st element:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a=36\ndeclare -p a\ndeclare -a a='([0]=\"36\" [1]=\"18\" [2]=\"one\" [3]=\"word\" [4]=\"hello world!\" [5]=\"he\nllo world!\" [6]=\"hello world!\")'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One argument format string with many argument passed to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>printf -v a[0] '&lt;%s&gt;\\n' \"${a[@]}\"\necho \"$a\"\n&lt;36&gt;\n&lt;18&gt;\n&lt;one&gt;\n&lt;word&gt;\n&lt;hello world!&gt;\n&lt;hello world!&gt;\n&lt;hello world!&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Using the <em>Stack&nbsp;Overflow question</em> syntax:</h3>\n\n<pre><code>foo=\"Hello\"\nprintf -v foo \"%s World\" $foo\necho $foo\nHello World\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nota: The use of <em>double-quotes</em> may be useful for manipulating strings that contain <code>spaces</code>, <code>tabulations</code> and/or <code>newlines</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>printf -v foo \"%s World\" \"$foo\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Shell now</h1>\n\n<p>Under <em>POSIX</em> shell, you could not use <em>bashisms</em>, so there is no <em>builtin</em> <code>printf</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Basically</h3>\n\n<p>But you could simply do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo=\"Hello\"\nfoo=\"$foo World\"\necho $foo\nHello World\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Formatted, using <em>forked</em> <code>printf</code></h3>\n\n<p>If you want to use more sophisticated constructions you have to use a <em>fork</em> (new child process that make the job and return the result via <code>stdout</code>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo=\"Hello\"\nfoo=$(printf \"%s World\" \"$foo\")\necho $foo\nHello World\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Historically, you could use <em>backticks</em> for retrieving result of a <em>fork</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo=\"Hello\"\nfoo=`printf \"%s World\" \"$foo\"`\necho $foo\nHello World\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But this is not easy for <em>nesting</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo=\"Today is: \"\nfoo=$(printf \"%s %s\" \"$foo\" \"$(date)\")\necho $foo\nToday is: Sun Aug 4 11:58:23 CEST 2013\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>with backticks, you have to escape inner forks with <em>backslashes</em>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo=\"Today is: \"\nfoo=`printf \"%s %s\" \"$foo\" \"\\`date\\`\"`\necho $foo\nToday is: Sun Aug 4 11:59:10 CEST 2013\n</code></pre>\n",

While the goals and implementation of the copy-constructor and destructor are straightforward, the copy-assignment operator is arguably the most nuanced and difficult. How should it be done? What pitfalls need to be avoided?</p>\n\n<p>The <em>copy-and-swap idiom</em> is the solution, and elegantly assists the assignment operator in achieving two things: avoiding <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">code duplication</a>, and providing a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_guarantees\">strong exception guarantee</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/what-is-the-copy-and-swap-idiom/3279616#3279616\">Conceptually</a>, it works by using the copy-constructor's functionality to create a local copy of the data, then takes the copied data with a <code>swap</code> function, swapping the old data with the new data. The temporary copy then destructs, taking the old data with it. We are left with a copy of the new data.</p>\n\n<p>In order to use the copy-and-swap idiom, we need three things: a working copy-constructor, a working destructor (both are the basis of any wrapper, so should be complete anyway), and a <code>swap</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>A swap function is a <em>non-throwing</em> function that swaps two objects of a class, member for member. We might be tempted to use <code>std::swap</code> instead of providing our own, but this would be impossible; <code>std::swap</code> uses the copy-constructor and copy-assignment operator within its implementation, and we'd ultimately be trying to define the assignment operator in terms of itself!</p>\n\n<p>(Not only that, but unqualified calls to <code>swap</code> will use our custom swap operator, skipping over the unnecessary construction and destruction of our class that <code>std::swap</code> would entail.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>An in-depth explanation</h2>\n\n<h3>The goal</h3>\n\n<p>Let's consider a concrete case. We want to manage, in an otherwise useless class, a dynamic array. We start with a working constructor, copy-constructor, and destructor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;algorithm&gt; // std::copy\n#include &lt;cstddef&gt; // std::size_t\n\nclass dumb_array\n{\npublic:\n    // (default) constructor\n    dumb_array(std::size_t size = 0)\n        : mSize(size),\n          mArray(mSize ? new int[mSize]() : 0)\n    {\n    }\n\n    // copy-constructor\n    dumb_array(const dumb_array&amp; other)\n        : mSize(other.mSize),\n          mArray(mSize ? new int[mSize] : 0),\n    {\n        // note that this is non-throwing, because of the data\n        // types being used; more attention to detail with regards\n        // to exceptions must be given in a more general case, however\n        std::copy(other.mArray, other.mArray + mSize, mArray);\n    }\n\n    // destructor\n    ~dumb_array()\n    {\n        delete [] mArray;\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::size_t mSize;\n    int* mArray;\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This class almost manages the array successfully, but it needs <code>operator=</code> to work correctly.</p>\n\n<h3>A failed solution</h3>\n\n<p>Here's how a naive implementation might look:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// the hard part\ndumb_array&amp; operator=(const dumb_array&amp; other)\n{\n    if (this != &amp;other) // (1)\n    {\n        // get rid of the old data...\n        delete [] mArray; // (2)\n        mArray = 0; // (2) *(see footnote for rationale)\n\n        // ...and put in the new\n        mSize = other.mSize; // (3)\n        mArray = mSize ? new int[mSize] : 0; // (3)\n        std::copy(other.mArray, other.mArray + mSize, mArray); // (3)\n    }\n\n    return *this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And we say we're finished; this now manages an array, without leaks. However, it suffers from three problems, marked sequentially in the code as <code>(n)</code>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The first  is the self-assignment test. This check serves two purposes: it's an easy way to prevent us from running needless code on self-assignment, and it protects us from subtle bugs (such as deleting the array only to try and copy it). But in all other cases it merely serves to slow the program down, and act as noise in the code; self-assignment rarely occurs, so most of the time this check is a waste. It would be better if the operator could work properly without it.</p></li>\n<li><p>The second is that it only provides a basic exception guarantee. If <code>new int[mSize]</code> fails, <code>*this</code> will have been modified. (Namely, the size is wrong and the data is gone!) For a strong exception guarantee, it would need to be something akin to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dumb_array&amp; operator=(const dumb_array&amp; other)\n{\n    if (this != &amp;other) // (1)\n    {\n        // get the new data ready before we replace the old\n        std::size_t newSize = other.mSize;\n        int* newArray = newSize ? new int[newSize]() : 0; // (3)\n        std::copy(other.mArray, other.mArray + newSize, newArray); // (3)\n\n        // replace the old data (all are non-throwing)\n        delete [] mArray;\n        mSize = newSize;\n        mArray = newArray;\n    }\n\n    return *this;\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>The code has expanded! Which leads us to the third problem: code duplication. Our assignment operator effectively duplicates all the code we've already written elsewhere, and that's a terrible thing.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In our case, the core of it is only two lines (the allocation and the copy), but with more complex resources this code bloat can be quite a hassle. We should strive to never repeat ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>(One might wonder: if this much code is needed to manage one resource correctly, what if my class manages more than one? While this may seem to be a valid concern, and indeed it requires non-trivial <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> clauses, this is a non-issue. That's because a class should manage <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle\"><em>one resource only</em></a>!)</p>\n\n<h3>A successful solution</h3>\n\n<p>As mentioned, the copy-and-swap idiom will fix all these issues. But right now, we have all the requirements except one: a <code>swap</code> function. While The Rule of Three successfully entails the existence of our copy-constructor, assignment operator, and destructor, it should really be called \"The Big Three and A Half\": any time your class manages a resource it also makes sense to provide a <code>swap</code> function.</p>\n\n<p>We need to add swap functionality to our class, and we do that as follows\u2020:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class dumb_array\n{\npublic:\n    // ...\n\n    friend void swap(dumb_array&amp; first, dumb_array&amp; second) // nothrow\n    {\n        // enable ADL (not necessary in our case, but good practice)\n        using std::swap;\n\n        // by swapping the members of two classes,\n        // the two classes are effectively swapped\n        swap(first.mSize, second.mSize);\n        swap(first.mArray, second.mArray);\n    }\n\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5695548/public-friend-swap-member-function\">Here</a> is the explanation why <code>public friend swap</code>.) Now not only can we swap our <code>dumb_array</code>'s, but swaps in general can be more efficient; it merely swaps pointers and sizes, rather than allocating and copying entire arrays. Aside from this bonus in functionality and efficiency, we are now ready to implement the copy-and-swap idiom.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, our assignment operator is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dumb_array&amp; operator=(dumb_array other) // (1)\n{\n    swap(*this, other); // (2)\n\n    return *this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that's it! With one fell swoop, all three problems are elegantly tackled at once.</p>\n\n<h3>Why does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>We first notice an important choice: the parameter argument is taken <em>by-value</em>. While one could just as easily do the following (and indeed, many naive implementations of the idiom do):</p>\n\n<pre><code>dumb_array&amp; operator=(const dumb_array&amp; other)\n{\n    dumb_array temp(other);\n    swap(*this, temp);\n\n    return *this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We lose an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140113221447/http://cpp-next.com/archive/2009/08/want-speed-pass-by-value/\">important optimization opportunity</a>. Not only that, but this choice is critical in C++11, which is discussed later. (On a general note, a remarkably useful guideline is as follows: if you're going to make a copy of something in a function, let the compiler do it in the parameter list.\u2021)</p>\n\n<p>Either way, this method of obtaining our resource is the key to eliminating code duplication: we get to use the code from the copy-constructor to make the copy, and never need to repeat any bit of it. Now that the copy is made, we are ready to swap.</p>\n\n<p>Observe that upon entering the function that all the new data is already allocated, copied, and ready to be used. This is what gives us a strong exception guarantee for free: we won't even enter the function if construction of the copy fails, and it's therefore not possible to alter the state of <code>*this</code>. (What we did manually before for a strong exception guarantee, the compiler is doing for us now; how kind.)</p>\n\n<p>At this point we are home-free, because <code>swap</code> is non-throwing. We swap our current data with the copied data, safely altering our state, and the old data gets put into the temporary. The old data is then released when the function returns. (Where upon the parameter's scope ends and its destructor is called.)</p>\n\n<p>Because the idiom repeats no code, we cannot introduce bugs within the operator. Note that this means we are rid of the need for a self-assignment check, allowing a single uniform implementation of <code>operator=</code>. (Additionally, we no longer have a performance penalty on non-self-assignments.)</p>\n\n<p>And that is the copy-and-swap idiom.</p>\n\n<h2>What about C++11?</h2>\n\n<p>The next version of C++, C++11, makes one very important change to how we manage resources: the Rule of Three is now <strong>The Rule of Four</strong> (and a half). Why? Because not only do we need to be able to copy-construct our resource, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106110/can-someone-please-explain-move-semantics-to-me\">we need to move-construct it as well</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily for us, this is easy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class dumb_array\n{\npublic:\n    // ...\n\n    // move constructor\n    dumb_array(dumb_array&amp;&amp; other)\n        : dumb_array() // initialize via default constructor, C++11 only\n    {\n        swap(*this, other);\n    }\n\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What's going on here? Recall the goal of move-construction: to take the resources from another instance of the class, leaving it in a state guaranteed to be assignable and destructible.</p>\n\n<p>So what we've done is simple: initialize via the default constructor (a C++11 feature), then swap with <code>other</code>; we know a default constructed instance of our class can safely be assigned and destructed, so we know <code>other</code> will be able to do the same, after swapping.</p>\n\n<p>(Note that some compilers do not support constructor delegation; in this case, we have to manually default construct the class. This is an unfortunate but luckily trivial task.)</p>\n\n<h3>Why does that work?</h3>\n\n<p>That is the only change we need to make to our class, so why does it work? Remember the ever-important decision we made to make the parameter a value and not a reference:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dumb_array&amp; operator=(dumb_array other); // (1)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, if <code>other</code> is being initialized with an rvalue, <em>it will be move-constructed</em>. Perfect. In the same way C++03 let us re-use our copy-constructor functionality by taking the argument by-value, C++11 will <em>automatically</em> pick the move-constructor when appropriate as well. (And, of course, as mentioned in previously linked article, the copying/moving of the value may simply be elided altogether.)</p>\n\n<p>And so concludes the copy-and-swap idiom.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\n\n<p>*Why do we set <code>mArray</code> to null? Because if any further code in the operator throws, the destructor of <code>dumb_array</code> might be called; and if that happens without setting it to null, we attempt to delete memory that's already been deleted! We avoid this by setting it to null, as deleting null is a no-operation.</p>\n\n<p>\u2020There are other claims that we should specialize <code>std::swap</code> for our type, provide an in-class <code>swap</code> along-side a free-function <code>swap</code>, etc. But this is all unnecessary: any proper use of <code>swap</code> will be through an unqualified call, and our function will be found through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument-dependent_name_lookup\">ADL</a>. One function will do.</p>\n\n<p>\u2021The reason is simple: once you have the resource to yourself, you may swap and/or move it (C++11) anywhere it needs to be. And by making the copy in the parameter list, you maximize optimization.</p>\n", "title": "What is the copy-and-swap idiom?", "answer_id": 3279550, "question_id": 3279543, "tags": ["c++", "copy-constructor", "assignment-operator", "c++-faq", "copy-and-swap"]}, {"body": "<p>Assignment, at its heart, is two steps: <strong><em>tearing down the object's old state</em></strong> and <strong><em>building its new state as a copy</em></strong> of some other object's state. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, that's what the <strong><em>destructor</em></strong> and the <strong><em>copy constructor</em></strong> do, so the first idea would be to delegate the work to them.

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct X\n{\n    T* p_;\n    size_t size_;\n    X&amp; operator=(const X&amp; rhs)\n    {\n        delete[] p_;  // OUCH!\n        p_ = new T[size_ = rhs.size_];\n        std::copy(p_, rhs.p_, rhs.p_ + rhs.size_);\n    }\n    ...\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On self-assignment, the above code delete's <code>x.p_;</code>, points <code>p_</code> at a newly allocated heap region, then attempts to read the <em>uninitialised</em> data therein (Undefined Behaviour), if that doesn't do anything too weird, <code>copy</code> attempts a self-assignment to every just-destructed 'T'!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>\u2042 The copy-and-swap idiom can introduce inefficiencies or limitations due to the use of an extra temporary (when the operator's parameter is copy-constructed):</p>\n\n<pre><code>struct Client\n{\n    IP_Address ip_address_;\n    int socket_;\n    X(const X&amp; rhs)\n      : ip_address_(rhs.ip_address_), socket_(connect(rhs.ip_address_))\n    { }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, a hand-written <code>Client::operator=</code> might check if <code>*this</code> is already connected to the same server as <code>rhs</code> (perhaps sending a \"reset\" code if useful), whereas the copy-and-swap approach would invoke the copy-constructor which would likely be written to open a distinct socket connection then close the original one.  Not only could that mean a remote network interaction instead of a simple in-process variable copy, it could run afoul of client or server limits on socket resources or connections.  (Of course this class has a pretty horrid interface, but that's another matter ;-P).</p>\n", "title": "What is the copy-and-swap idiom?", "answer_id": 22227972, "question_id": 3279543, "tags": ["c++", "copy-constructor", "assignment-operator", "c++-faq", "copy-and-swap"]}, {"body": "<p>I would like to add a word of warning when you are dealing with C++11-style allocator-aware containers. Swapping and assignment have subtly different semantics.</p>\n\n<p>For concreteness, let us consider a container <code>std::vector&lt;T, A&gt;</code>, where <code>A</code> is some stateful allocator type, and we'll compare the following functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void fs(std::vector&lt;T, A&gt; &amp; a, std::vector&lt;T, A&gt; &amp; b)\n{ \n    a.swap(b);\n    b.clear(); // not important what you do with b\n}\n\nvoid fm(std::vector&lt;T, A&gt; &amp; a, std::vector&lt;T, A&gt; &amp; b)\n{\n    a = std::move(b);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The purpose of both functions <code>fs</code> and <code>fm</code> is to give <code>a</code> the state that <code>b</code> had initially. However, there is a hidden question: What happens if <code>a.get_allocator() != b.get_allocator()</code>? The answer is: It depends. Let's write <code>AT = std::allocator_traits&lt;A&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If <code>AT::propagate_on_container_move_assignment</code> is <code>std::true_type</code>, then <code>fm</code> reassigns the allocator of <code>a</code> with the value of <code>b.get_allocator()</code>, otherwise it does not, and <code>a</code> continues to use its original allocator. In that case, the data elements need to be swapped individually, since the storage of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> is not compatible.</p></li>\n<li><p>If <code>AT::propagate_on_container_swap</code> is <code>std::true_type</code>, then <code>fs</code> swaps both data and allocators in the expected fashion.</p></li>\n<li><p>If <code>AT::propagate_on_container_swap</code> is <code>std::false_type</code>, then we need a dynamic check.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If <code>a.get_allocator() == b.get_allocator()</code>, then the two containers use compatible storage, and swapping proceeds in the usual fashion.</li>\n<li>However, if <code>a.get_allocator() != b.get_allocator()</code>, the program has <em>undefined behaviour</em> (cf. [container.requirements.general/8].</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The upshot is that swapping has become a non-trivial operation in C++11 as soon as your container starts supporting stateful allocators. That's a somewhat \"advanced use case\", but it's not entirely unlikely, since move optimizations usually only become interesting once your class manages a resource, and memory is one of the most popular resources.</p>\n", "title": "What is the copy-and-swap idiom?", "answer_id": 24381568, "question_id": 3279543, "tags": ["c++", "copy-constructor", "assignment-operator", "c++-faq", "copy-and-swap"]}], "question_id": 3279543}, {"body": "<p>What is the most appropriate way to test if a variable is undefined in JavaScript?

Here are several cites of relevance:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From JSP 1.2 Specification, it is highly recommended that the JSP Standard Tag Library  (JSTL) be used in your web application to help <strong>reduce the need for JSP scriptlets</strong> in your pages. Pages that use JSTL are, in general, easier to read and maintain. </p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>Where possible, <strong>avoid JSP scriptlets</strong> whenever tag libraries provide equivalent functionality. This makes pages easier to read and maintain, helps to separate business logic from presentation logic, and will make your pages easier to evolve into JSP 2.0-style pages (JSP 2.0 Specification supports but deemphasizes the use of scriptlets).</p>\n  \n  <p>...</p>\n  \n  <p>In the spirit of adopting the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern to reduce coupling between the presentation tier from the business logic, <strong>JSP scriptlets should not be used</strong> for writing business logic. Rather, JSP scriptlets are used if necessary to transform data (also called \"value objects\") returned from processing the client's requests into a proper client-ready format. Even then, this would be better done with a front controller servlet or a custom tag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>How to replace <em>scriptlets</em> entirely depends on the sole purpose of the code/logic. More than often this code is to be placed in a fullworthy Java class:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke the <strong>same</strong> Java code on <em>every</em> request, less-or-more regardless of the requested page, e.g. checking if an user is logged in, then implement a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info\">filter</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/Filter.html#doFilter%28javax.servlet.ServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.ServletResponse,%20javax.servlet.FilterChain%29\"><code>doFilter()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    if (((HttpServletRequest) request).getSession().getAttribute(\"user\") == null) {\n        ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect(\"login\"); // Not logged in, redirect to login page.\n    } else {\n        chain.doFilter(request, response); // Logged in, just continue request.\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When mapped on an appropriate <code>&lt;url-pattern&gt;</code> covering the JSP pages of interest, then you don't need to copypaste the same piece of code over all JSP pages.</p>\n\n<hr></li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>preprocess</strong> a request, e.g. preloading some list from a database to display in some table, if necessary based on some query parameters, then implement a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html#doGet%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse%29\"><code>doGet()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    try {\n        List&lt;Product&gt; products = productService.list(); // Obtain all products.\n        request.setAttribute(\"products\", products); // Store products in request scope.\n        request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/WEB-INF/products.jsp\").forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to display them in a HTML table.\n    } catch (SQLException e) {\n        throw new ServletException(\"Retrieving products failed!\", e);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way dealing with exceptions is easier. The DB is not accessed in the midst of JSP rendering, but far before the JSP is been displayed. You still have the possibility to change the response whenever the DB access throws an exception. In the above example, the default error 500 page will be displayed which you can anyway customize by an <code>&lt;error-page&gt;</code> in <code>web.xml</code>.</p>\n\n<hr></li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>postprocess</strong> a request, e.g. processing a form submit, then implement a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html#doPost%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse%29\"><code>doPost()</code></a> method.

Please retry.\"); // Store error message in request scope.\n        request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/WEB-INF/login.jsp\").forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to redisplay login form with error.\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way dealing with different result page destinations is easier: redisplaying the form with validation errors in case of an error (in this particular example you can redisplay it using <code>${message}</code> in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info\">EL</a>), or just taking to the desired target page in case of success.</p>\n\n<hr></li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>control</strong> the execution plan and/or the destination of the request and the response, then implement a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\">servlet</a> according the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541077/design-patterns-web-based-applications/3542297#3542297\">MVC's Front Controller Pattern</a>. E.g.:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-java prettyprint-override\"><code>protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n    try {\n        Action action = ActionFactory.getAction(request);\n        String view = action.execute(request, response);\n\n        if (view.equals(request.getPathInfo().substring(1)) {\n            request.getRequestDispatcher(\"/WEB-INF/\" + view + \".jsp\").forward(request, response);\n        } else {\n            response.sendRedirect(view);\n        }\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        throw new ServletException(\"Executing action failed.\", e);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or just adopt a MVC framework like <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info\">JSF</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-mvc/info\">Spring MVC</a>, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/wicket/info\">Wicket</a>, etc so that you end up with just a JSP/Facelets page and a Javabean class without the need for a custom servlet.</p>\n\n<hr></li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>control the flow</strong> inside a JSP page, then you need to grab an (existing) flow control taglib like <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/jstl/1.1/docs/tlddocs/c/tld-summary.html\">JSTL core</a>. E.g. displaying <code>List&lt;Product&gt;</code> in a table:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;%@ taglib uri=\"http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core\" prefix=\"c\" %&gt;\n...\n&lt;table&gt;\n    &lt;c:forEach items=\"${products}\" var=\"product\"&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;${product.name}&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;${product.description}&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;${product.price}&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/c:forEach&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With XML-style tags which fits nicely among all that HTML, the code is better readable (and thus better maintainable) than a bunch of scriptlets with various opening and closing braces (<em>\"Where the heck does this closing brace belong to?\"</em>). An easy aid is to configure your web application to throw an exception whenever <em>scriptlets</em> are still been used by adding the following piece to <code>web.xml</code>:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-xml prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;jsp-config&gt;\n    &lt;jsp-property-group&gt;\n        &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n        &lt;scripting-invalid&gt;true&lt;/scripting-invalid&gt;\n    &lt;/jsp-property-group&gt;\n&lt;/jsp-config&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/facelets/info\">Facelets</a>, the successor of JSP, which is part of the Java EE provided MVC framework <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info\">JSF</a>, it is already <strong>not</strong> possible to use <em>scriptlets</em>. This way you're automatically forced to do things \"the right way\".</p>\n\n<hr></li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>access and display</strong> \"backend\" data inside a JSP page, then you need to use EL (Expression Language), those <code>${}</code> things. E.g. redisplaying submitted input values:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"${param.foo}\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>${param.foo}</code> displays the outcome of <code>request.getParameter(\"foo\")</code>.</p>\n\n<hr></li>\n<li><p>If you want to invoke some <strong>utility</strong> Java code directly in the JSP page (typically <code>public static</code> methods), then you need to define them as EL functions. There's a standard <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/jstl/1.1/docs/tlddocs/fn/tld-summary.html\">functions taglib</a> in JSTL, but <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnahq.html#bnaiq\">you can also easily create functions yourself</a>. Here's an example how JSTL <code>fn:escapeXml</code> is useful to prevent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">XSS</a> <a href=\"http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html\">attacks</a>.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;%@ taglib uri=\"http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions\" prefix=\"fn\" %&gt;\n...\n&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"foo\" value=\"${fn:escapeXml(param.foo)}\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the XSS sensitivity is in no way specifically related to Java/JSP/JSTL/EL/whatever, this problem needs to be taken into account in <strong>every</strong> webapplication you develop. The problem of <em>scriptlets</em> is that it provides no way of builtin preventions, at least not using the standard Java API. JSP's successor Facelets has already implicit HTML escaping, so you don't need to worry about XSS holes in Facelets.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>See also:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2095397/what-is-the-difference-between-jsf-servlet-and-jsp/2097732#2097732\">What's the difference between JSP, Servlet and JSF?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106452/java-servlet-instantiation-and-session-variables/3106909#3106909\">How does Servlet, ServletContext, HttpSession and HttpServletRequest/Response work?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5003142/jsp-using-mvc-and-jdbc\">Basic MVC example with JSP, Servlet and JDBC</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541077/design-patterns-web-based-applications/\">Design patterns in Java web applications</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://balusc.blogspot.com/2010/01/hidden-features-of-jspservlet.html\">Hidden features of JSP/Servlet</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "How to avoid Java code in JSP files?", "answer_id": 3180202, "question_id": 3177733, "tags": ["java", "jsp", "scriptlet"]}, {"body": "<p>In MVC Design pattern, jsp pages represents the View layer.

So in addition to my explanation, I'll provide some algorithms with simple print statements to illustrate the complexity of different algorithm categories. </p>\n\n<p>First, you'll want to have a general idea of Logarithm, which you can get from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm</a> . Natural science use <code>e</code> and the natural log. Engineering disciples will use log_10 (log base 10) and computer scientists will use log_2 (log base 2) a lot, since computers are binary based. Sometimes you'll see abbreviations of natural log as <code>ln()</code>, engineers normally leave the _10 off and just use <code>log()</code> and log_2 is abbreviated as <code>lg()</code>. All of the types of logarithms grow in a similar fashion, that is why they share the same category of <code>log(n)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>When you look at the code examples below, I recommend looking at O(1), then O(n), then O(n^2). After you are good with those, then look at the others. I've included clean examples as well as variations to demonstrate how subtle changes can still result in the same categorization.</p>\n\n<p>You can think of O(1), O(n), O(logn), etc as classes or categories of growth. Some categories will take more time to do than others. These categories help give us a way of ordering the algorithm performance. Some grown faster as the input n grows. The following table demonstrates said growth numerically. In the table below think of log(n) as the ceiling of log_2. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yiP0.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yiP0.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Simple Code Examples Of Various Big O Categories:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>O(1) - Constant Time Examples:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Algorithm 1:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Algorithm 1 prints hello once and it doesn't depend on n, so it will always run in constant time, so it is <code>O(1)</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>print \"hello\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Algorithm 2:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Algorithm 2 prints hello 3 times, however it does not depend on an input size.

For example, postgresql-8.4.4 instead of the latest 9.0.</p>\n", "title": "Homebrew install specific version of formula?", "tags": ["installation", "versioning", "homebrew"], "answer_count": 16, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3987683/homebrew-install-specific-version-of-formula", "answers": [{"body": "<p>(<em>I\u2019ve re-edited my answer to give a more thorough workflow for installing/using older software versions with homebrew. Feel free to add a note if you found the old version better.</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the simplest case:</p>\n\n<h2>1) Check, whether the version is already installed (but not activated)</h2>\n\n<p>When homebrew installs a new formula, it puts it in a versioned directory like <code>/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.1</code>. Only symbolic links to this folder are then installed globally. In principle, this makes it pretty easy to switch between two installed versions. (*)</p>\n\n<p>If you have been using homebrew for longer and never removed older versions (using, for example <code>brew cleanup</code>), chances are that some older version of your program may still be around. If you want to simply activate that previous version, <code>brew switch</code> is the easiest way to do this.</p>\n\n<p>Check with <code>brew info postgresql</code> (or <code>brew switch postgresql &lt;TAB&gt;</code>) whether the older version is installed:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ brew info postgresql\npostgresql: stable 9.3.2 (bottled)\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/\nConflicts with: postgres-xc\n/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5 (2755 files, 37M)\n  Built from source\n/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2 (2924 files, 39M) *\n  Poured from bottle\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n# \u2026 and some more\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We see that some older version is already installed. We may activate it using <code>brew switch</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ brew switch postgresql 9.1.5\nCleaning /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5\nCleaning /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2\n384 links created for /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s double-check what is activated:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ brew info postgresql\npostgresql: stable 9.3.2 (bottled)\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/\nConflicts with: postgres-xc\n/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.1.5 (2755 files, 37M) *\n  Built from source\n/usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.2 (2924 files, 39M)\n  Poured from bottle\nFrom: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/commits/master/Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n# \u2026 and some more\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the star <code>*</code> has moved to the newly activated version</p>\n\n<p>(*) <em>Please note that <code>brew switch</code> only works as long as all dependencies of the older version are still around. In some cases, a rebuild of the older version may become necessary. Therefore, using <code>brew switch</code> is mostly useful when one wants to switch between two versions not too far apart.</em></p>\n\n<h2>2) Check, whether the version is available as a tap</h2>\n\n<p>Especially for larger software projects, it is very probably that there is a high enough demand for several (potentially API incompatible) major versions of a certain piece of software. As of March 2012, <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-0.9\">Homebrew 0.9</a> provides a mechanism for this: <code>brew tap</code> &amp; the <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions\">homebrew versions</a> repository.</p>\n\n<p>That versions repository may include backports of older versions for several formulae. (Mostly only the large and famous ones, but of course they\u2019ll also have several formulae for postgresql.)</p>\n\n<p><code>brew search postgresql</code> will show you where to look:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ brew search postgresql\npostgresql\nhomebrew/versions/postgresql8    homebrew/versions/postgresql91\nhomebrew/versions/postgresql9    homebrew/versions/postgresql92\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can simply install it by typing</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ brew install homebrew/versions/postgresql8\nCloning into '/usr/local/Library/Taps/homebrew-versions'...\nremote: Counting objects: 1563, done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (943/943), done.\nremote: Total 1563 (delta 864), reused 1272 (delta 620)\nReceiving objects: 100% (1563/1563), 422.83 KiB | 339.00 KiB/s, done.\nResolving deltas: 100% (864/864), done.\nChecking connectivity... done.\nTapped 125 formula\n==&gt; Downloading http://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/source/v8.4.19/postgresql-8.4.19.tar.bz2\n# \u2026\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that this has automatically <em>tapped</em> the <code>homebrew/versions</code> tap. (Check with <code>brew tap</code>, remove with <code>brew untap homebrew/versions</code>.) The following would have been equivalent:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ brew tap homebrew/versions\n$ brew install postgresql8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As long as the backported version formulae stay up-to-date, this approach is probably the best way to deal with older software.</p>\n\n<h2>3) Try some formula from the past</h2>\n\n<p>The following approaches are listed mostly for completeness. Both try to resurrect some undead formula from the brew repository. Due to changed dependencies, API changes in the formula spec or simply a change in the download URL, things may or may not work.</p>\n\n<p>Since the whole formula directory is a git repository, one can install specific versions using plain git commands. However, we need to find a way to get to a commit where the old version was available.</p>\n\n<p><strong>a) historic times</strong></p>\n\n<p>Between August 2011 and October 2014, homebrew had a <code>brew versions</code> command, which spat out all available versions with their respective SHA hashes. As of October 2014, you have to do a <code>brew tap homebrew/boneyard</code> before you can use it. As the name of the tap suggests, you should probably only do this as a last resort.</p>\n\n<p>E.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ brew versions postgresql\nWarning: brew-versions is unsupported and may be removed soon.\nPlease use the homebrew-versions tap instead:\n  https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions\n9.3.2    git checkout 3c86d2b Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.3.1    git checkout a267a3e Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.3.0    git checkout ae59e09 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.2.4    git checkout e3ac215 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.2.3    git checkout c80b37c Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.2.2    git checkout 9076baa Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.2.1    git checkout 5825f62 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.2.0    git checkout 2f6cbc6 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.1.5    git checkout 6b8d25f Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.1.4    git checkout c40c7bf Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.1.3    git checkout 05c7954 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.1.2    git checkout dfcc838 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.1.1    git checkout 4ef8fb0 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.0.4    git checkout 2accac4 Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n9.0.3    git checkout b782d9d Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, it advises against using it. Homebrew spits out all versions it can find with its internal heuristic and shows you a way to retrieve the old formulae. Let\u2019s try it.</p>\n\n<pre><code># First, go to the homebrew base directory\n$ cd $( brew --prefix )\n# Checkout some old formula\n$ git checkout 6b8d25f Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n$ brew install postgresql\n# \u2026 installing\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that the older postgresql version is installed, we can re-install the latest formula in order to keep our repository clean:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git checkout -- Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>brew switch</code> is your friend to change between the old and the new.</p>\n\n<p><strong>b) prehistoric times</strong></p>\n\n<p>For special needs, we may also try our own digging through the homebrew repo.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ git log -S'8.4.4' -- Library/Formula/postgresql.rb\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>git log -S</code> looks for all commits in which the string <code>'8.4.4'</code> was either added or removed in the file <code>Library/Formula/postgresql.rb</code>.

Authentication by schemes outside the scope of RFC7235 are not supported in HTTP status codes and are not considered when deciding whether to use 401 or 403.</p>\n\n<h1>Brief and Terse</h1>\n\n<p>Unauthorized indicates that the client is not RFC7235 authenticated and the server is initiating the authentication process.

If the 401\n     response contains the same challenge as the prior response, and the\n     user agent has already attempted authentication at least once, then\n     the user agent SHOULD present the enclosed representation to the\n     user, since it usually contains relevant diagnostic information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that \"Authentication\" and \"Authorization\" in the context of this document refer specifically to official IANA-registered HTTP Authentication protocols. They do not refer to any roll-your-own authentication protocols you may have created using login pages, etc. I will use \"login\" to refer to authentication and authorization by methods other than IANA-registered HTTP Authentication protocols.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing to keep in mind is that \"Authorization\" in the context of HTTP/1.1, both in terms of the Authorization header and the language of the spec, really just means \"authentication\", which is confusing. The spec says \"credentials that are not adequate to gain access\" instead of \"credentials for an account that is unauthorized\"; it does not use the word \"authorized\" in the conventional security sense.</p>\n\n<p>So the real difference is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>401 indicates that the resource cannot be provided, but the server is REQUESTING that the client log in through HTTP Authentication and has sent reply headers to initiate the process. Possibly there are credentials with permissions to access the resource, possibly there are not, but let's give it a try and see what happens.</p>\n\n<p>403 indicates that the resource can not be provided to the client given the current credentials, and different credentials might or might not produce different results. This may be because it is known that no level of authentication is sufficient (for instance where there is an old-style use of the 403 code: a protected file such as <code>.htaccess</code> that can only be accessed out-of-band, e.g. via <code>ssh</code>), but it may be because the user is already authenticated and does not have authority.

People just know that Context is needed quite often to do basic things in Android. People sometimes panic because they try to do perform some operation that requires the Context and they don\u2019t know how to \u201cget\u201d the right Context. I\u2019m going to try to demystify the idea of Context in Android. A full treatment of the issue is beyond the scope of this post, but I\u2019ll try to give a general overview so that you have a sense of what Context is and how to use it. To understand what Context is, let\u2019s take a look at the source code: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#search&amp;q=package:android.git.kernel.org+file:android/content/Context.java\">http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#search&amp;q=package:android.git.kernel.org+file:android/content/Context.java</a> </p>\n\n<p><strong>What exactly is Context?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Well, the documentation itself provides a rather straightforward explanation: The Context class is an \u201cInterface to global information about an application environment\". </p>\n\n<p>The Context class itself is declared as abstract class, whose implementation is provided by the Android OS. The documentation further provides that Context \u201c\u2026allows access to application-specific resources and classes, as well as up-calls for application-level operations such as launching activities, broadcasting and receiving intents, etc\". </p>\n\n<p>You can understand very well, now, why the name is Context. It\u2019s because it\u2019s just that. The Context provides the link or hook, if you will, for an Activity, Service, or any other component, thereby linking it to the system, enabling access to the global application environment. \nIn other words: the Context provides the answer to the components question of \u201cwhere the hell am I in relation to app generally and how do I access/communicate with the rest of the app?\u201d If this all seems a bit confusing, a quick look at the methods exposed by the Context class provides some further clues about its true nature. </p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a random sampling of those methods: \n1. getAssets() \n2. getResources() \n3. getPackageManager() \n4. getString()\n5. getSharedPrefsFile() </p>\n\n<p>What do all these methods have in common? They all enable whoever has access to the Context to be able to access application-wide resources.</p>\n\n<p>Context, in other words, hooks the component that has a reference to it to the rest of application environment. The assets (think \u2019/assets\u2019 folder in your project), for example, are available across the application, provided that an Activity, Service or whatever knows how to access those resources. \nSame goes for \u201cgetResources()\u201d which allows to do things like \u201cgetResources().getColor()\u201d which will hook you into the colors.xml resource (nevermind that aapt enables access to resources via java code, that\u2019s a separate issue). </p>\n\n<p>The upshot is that Context is what enables access to system resources and its what hooks components into the \u201cgreater app\".\nLet\u2019s look at the subclasses of Context, the classes that provide the implementation of the abstract Context class. \nThe most obvious class is the Activity class. Activity inherits from ContextThemeWrapper, which inherits from ContextWrapper, which inherits from Context itself. \nThose classes are useful to look at to understand things at a deeper level, but for now it\u2019s sufficient to know that ContextThemeWrapper and ContextWrapper are pretty much what they sound like.\nThey implement the abstract elements of the Context class itself by \u201cwrapping\u201d a context (the actual context) and delegating those functions to that context.\n An example is helpful - in the ContextWrapper class, the abstract method \u201cgetAssets\u201d from the Context class is implemented as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\n    public AssetManager getAssets() {\n        return mBase.getAssets();\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>mBase is simply a field set by the constructor to a specific context.\nSo a context is wrapped and the ContextWrapper delegates its implementation of the getAssets method to that context. Let\u2019s get back to examining the Activity class which ultimately inherits from Context to see how this all works. </p>\n\n<p>You probably know what an Activity is, but to review - it\u2019s basically 'a single thing the user can do. It takes care of providing a window in which to place the UI that the user interacts with'.\nDevelopers familiar with other APIs and even non-developers might think of it vernacularly as a \u201cscreen.\u201d That\u2019s technically inaccurate, but it doesn\u2019t matter for our purposes. So how do Activity and Context interact and what exactly is going in their inheritance relationship? </p>\n\n<p>Again, it\u2019s helpful to look at specific examples. We all know how to launch Activities. Provided you have \u201cthe context\u201d from which you are you are starting the Activity, you simply call startActivity(intent), where the Intent describes the context from which you are starting an Activity and the Activity you\u2019d like to start. This is the familiar startActivity(this, SomeOtherActivity.class). </p>\n\n<p>And what is \u201cthis\u201d? \u201cthis\u201d is your Activity because the Activity class inherits from Context. The full scoop is like this: When you call startActivity, ultimately the Activity class executes something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Instrumentation.ActivityResult ar =\n                mInstrumentation.execStartActivity(\n                    this, mMainThread.getApplicationThread(), mToken, this,\n                    intent, requestCode);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ok, so it utilizes the execStartActivity from the Instrumentation class (actually from an inner class in Instrumentation called ActivityResult).</p>\n\n<p>At this point we are beginning to get a peek at the system internals.</p>\n\n<p>This is where OS actually handles everything. So how does Instrumentation start the Activity exactly? Well, the param \u201cthis\u201d in the execStartActivity method above is the your Activity, i.e. the Context, and the execStartActivity makes use of this context. </p>\n\n<p>A 30,000 overview is this: the Instrumentation class keeps tracks of a list of Activities that it\u2019s monitoring in order to do it\u2019s work. This list is used to coordinate all of the activities and make sure everything runs smoothly in managing the flow of activities.</p>\n\n<p>There are some operations which I haven\u2019t fully looked into which coordinate thread and process issues. Ultimately, the ActivityResult uses a native operation - ActivityManagerNative.getDefault().startActivity() which uses the Context that you passed in when you called startActivity. The context you passed in is used to assist in \u201cintent resolution\u201d if needed. Intent resolution is the process by which the system can determine the target of the intent if it is not supplied. (Check out the guide here for more details).</p>\n\n<p>And in order for Android to do this, it needs access to information that is supplied by Context. Specifically, the system needs to access to a ContentResolver so it can \u201cdetermine the MIME type of the intent\u2019s data\". \nThis whole bit about how startActivity makes use of context was a bit complicated and I don\u2019t fully understand the internals myself. My main point was just to illustrate how application-wide resources need to be accessed in order to perform many of the operations that are essential to an app. Context is what provides access to these resources.\n A simpler example might be Views. We all know what you create a custom View by extending RelativeLayout or some other View class, you must provide a constructor that takes a Context as an argument. When you instantiate your custom View you pass in the context.\n Why? Because the View needs to be able to have access to themes, resources, and other View configuration details.\nView configuration is actually a great example. Each Context has various parameters (fields in Context\u2019s implementations) that are set by the OS itself for things like the dimension or density of the display. It\u2019s easy to see why this information is important for setting up Views, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>One final word:</strong> \nFor some reason people new to Android (and even people not so new) seem to completely forget about object-oriented programming when it comes to Android. For some reason, people try to bend their Android development to pre-conceived paradigms or learned behaviors. </p>\n\n<p>Android has it\u2019s own paradigm and a certain pattern that is actually quite consistent if let go of your pre-conceived notions and simply read the documentation and dev guide. My real point, however, while \u201cgetting the right context\u201d can sometimes be tricky, people unjustifiably panic because they run into a situation where they need the context and think they don\u2019t have it. Once again, Java is an object-oriented language with an inheritance design.</p>\n\n<p>You only \u201chave\u201d the context inside of your Activity because your activity itself inherits from Context. There\u2019s no magic to it (except for the all the stuff the OS does by itself to set various parameters and to correctly \u201cconfigure\u201d your context). So, putting memory/performance issues aside (e.g. holding references to context when you don\u2019t need to or doing it in a way that has negative consequences on memory, etc), Context is an object like any other and it can be passed around just like any POJO (Plain Old Java Object). \nSometimes you might need to do clever things to retrieve that context, but any regular Java class that extends from nothing other than Object itself can be written in a way that has access to context; simply expose a public method that takes a context and then use it in that class as needed. This was not intended as an exhaustive treatment on Context or Android internals, but I hope it\u2019s helpful in demystifying Context a little bit. </p>\n", "title": "What is &#39;Context&#39; on Android?", "answer_id": 16301475, "question_id": 3572463, "tags": ["android", "android-context"]}, {"body": "<p>Just putting it out there for newbies;</p>\n\n<p>So First understand Word Context :</p>\n\n<p>In english-lib. it means:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or\n  idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"The parts of something written or spoken that immediately precede and\n  follow a word or passage and clarify its meaning.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now take the same understanding to programming world:</p>\n\n<p>context of current state of the application/object.

The group I was working\n  in was doing preliminary work on the Mission Control Center computer\n  systems and programs.  My office mate had the job of testing out an\n  orbit computation program which had been used during the Mercury\n  flights.  Running some test data with known answers through it, he was\n  getting answers that were close, but not accurate enough.  So, he\n  started looking for numerical problems in the algorithm, checking to\n  make sure his tests data was really correct, etc.</p>\n  \n  <p>After a couple of weeks with no results, he came across a <code>DO</code>\n  statement, in the form:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DO 10 I=1.10\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>This statement was interpreted by the compiler (correctly) as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DO10I = 1.10\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>The programmer had clearly intended:</p>\n\n<pre><code>DO 10 I = 1, 10\n</code></pre>\n  \n  <p>After changing the <code>.</code> to a <code>,</code> the program results were correct to\n  the desired accuracy.  Apparently, the program's answers had been\n  \"good enough\" for the sub-orbital Mercury flights, so no one suspected\n  a bug until they tried to get greater accuracy, in anticipation of\n  later orbital and moon flights.  As far as I know, this particular bug\n  was never blamed for any actual failure of a space flight, but the\n  other details here seem close enough that I'm sure this incident is the\n  source of the <code>DO</code> story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it's a big WTF if <code>DO 10 I</code> is taken as <code>DO10I</code>, and that in turn, because of implicit declarations is taken to be of type <code>REAL</code>.

Essentially, a huge multidimensional hash table, supported by a B* tree that made for very fast access.

However this\nsolution also works if the real size is in some situations bigger than\nthe hard-coded size. In that event the transition might jump a bit,\nbut it will never leave a partially visible element.\nSo this solution could also be used for unknown content, e.g. from\na database, where you just know that the content is usually not bigger\nthan x pixels, but there are exceptions.</p>\n\n<p>Idea is to use a negative value for margin-bottom (or margin-top for a\nslightly diffenrent animation) and to place the content element into a\nmiddle element with overflow:hidden. The negative margin of the content\nelement so reduces the height of the middle element.</p>\n\n<p>The following code uses a transition on margin-bottom from -150px to\n0px.  This alone works fine as long as the content element is not\nhigher than 150px. In addition it uses a transition on max-height for the\nmiddle element from 0px to 100%.  This finally hides the middle element\nif the content element is higher than 150px.\nFor max-height the transition is just used to delay its application\nby a second when closing, not for a smooth visiual effect (\nand therefore it can run from  0px to 100%).</p>\n\n<p>CSS:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.content {\n  transition: margin-bottom 1s ease-in;\n  margin-bottom: -150px;\n}\n.outer:hover .middle .content {\n  transition: margin-bottom 1s ease-out;\n  margin-bottom: 0px\n}\n.middle {\n  overflow: hidden;\n  transition: max-height .1s ease 1s;\n  max-height: 0px\n}\n.outer:hover .middle {\n  transition: max-height .1s ease 0s;\n  max-height: 100%\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"outer\"&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"middle\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"content\"&gt;\n      Sample Text\n      &lt;br&gt; Sample Text\n      &lt;br&gt; Sample Text\n      &lt;div style=\"height:150px\"&gt;Sample Test of height 150px&lt;/div&gt;\n      Sample Text\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  Hover Here\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The value for margin bottom should be negative and as close as\npossible to the real height of the content element. If it('s absoute\nvalue) is bigger there are similar delay and timing problems as with\nthe max-height solutions, which however can be limited as long as the\nhard coded size is not much bigger than the real one. If the absolute\nvalue for margin-bottom is smaller than the real height the \ntansition jumps a bit.

I know this problem is as old as the internet but I think I have a solution which I turned into a <a href=\"https://github.com/jontroncoso/mutant-transition\">plugin called mutant-transition</a>. My solution sets the <code>style=\"\"</code> attributes for tracked elements whenever theres a change in the DOM. the end result is that you can use good ole CSS for your transitions and not use hacky fixes or special javascript. The only thing you have to do is set what you want to track on the element in question using <code>data-mutant-attributes=\"X\"</code>. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div data-mutant-attributes=\"height\"&gt;                                                                      \n        This is an example with mutant-transition                                                                                                          \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thats it! This solution uses <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver\">MutationObserver</a> to follow changes in the DOM. Because of this, you don't really have to set anything up or use javascript to manually animate things. Changes are tracked automatically.

The thing is: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>what we really want is change height</p></li>\n<li><p>The height is the sum of all list items inside the submenu</p></li>\n<li><p>We usually know the height of a list item, since we're styling it </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So my solution applies to 'normal' submenus where items names have only 1 row. Anyway, with a little more js one could accomodate even more than 1 row names.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, what I do is simply count the submenus items and apply specific classes accordingly. Then pass the ball to (s)css. So, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var main_menu = $('.main-menu');\nvar submenus = $('.main-menu').find('.submenu');\nsubmenus.each(function(index,item){\n   var i = $(item);\n   i.addClass('has-' + i.find('li').length + '-children');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can use any class/selector, obviously. At this point we have submenus like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul class=\"submenu has-3-children\"&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And our css like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.submenu{\n   //your styles [...]\n   height:0;\n   overflow:hidden;\n   transition: all 200ms ease-in-out; //assume Autoprefixer is used\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We will also have some scss variables like these (arbitrary example):</p>\n\n<pre><code>$sub_item_height:30px;\n$sub_item_border:2px;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At this point, assumed that opened main menu items will get a class like 'opened' or the like (your implemetations..), we can do something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//use a number of children reasonably high so it won't be overcomed by real buttons\n.main-menu .opened .submenu{\n   &amp;.has-1-children{ height:   $sub_item_height*1  + $sub_item_border*1;  }\n   &amp;.has-2-children{ height:   $sub_item_height*2  + $sub_item_border*2;  }\n   &amp;.has-3-children{ height:   $sub_item_height*3  + $sub_item_border*3;  }\n   //and so on....\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, to shorten up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.main-menu .opened .submenu{\n   @for $i from 1 through 12{//12 is totally arbitrary\n      &amp;.has-#{$i}-children { height: $menu_item_height * $i + $menu_item_border * $i; }\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For most of the times, this will do the job.

The property always contains the \"full\" height of an element, regardless of whether and how its content overflows as a result of collapsed height (e.g. <code>height: 0</code>).</p>\n\n<p>As such, for a <code>height: 0</code> (effectively fully collapsed) element, its \"normal\" or \"full\" height is still readily available through its <code>scrollHeight</code> value (invariably a <em>pixel</em> length).</p>\n\n<p>For such an element, assuming it already has the transition set up like e.g. (using <code>ul</code> as per original question):</p>\n\n<pre><code>ul {\n    height: 0;\n    transition: height 1s; /* An example transition. */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We can trigger desired animated \"expansion\" of height, using CSS only, with something like the following (here assuming <code>ul</code> variable refers to the list):</p>\n\n<pre><code>ul.style.height = ul.scrollHeight + \"px\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's it. If you need to collapse the list, either of the two following statements will do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ul.style.height = 0;\nul.style.removeProperty(\"height\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My particular use case revolved around animating lists of unknown and often considerable lengths, so I was not comfortable settling on an arbitrary \"large enough\" <code>height</code> or <code>max-height</code> specification and risking cut-off content or content that you suddenly need to scroll (if <code>overflow: auto</code>, for example). Additionally, the easing and timing is broken with <code>max-height</code>-based solutions, because the used height may reach its maximum value a lot sooner than it would take for <code>max-height</code> to reach <code>9999px</code>. And as screen resolutions grow, pixel lengths like <code>9999px</code> leave a bad taste in my mouth. This particular solution solves the problem in an elegant manner, in my opinion.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, here is hoping that future revisions of CSS address authors need to do these kind of things even more elegantly -- revisit the notion of \"computed\" vs \"used\" and \"resolved\" values, and consider whether transitions should apply to computed values, including transitions with <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> (which currently get a bit of a special treatment).</p>\n", "title": "How can I transition height: 0; to height: auto; using CSS?", "answer_id": 38210749, "question_id": 3508605, "tags": ["css", "css3", "css-transitions"]}, {"body": "<p>How about instead of height, you use something like below one</p>\n\n<pre><code>#child0 {\n  visibility: hidden;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: visibility 0s, opacity 0.5s linear;\n  position: absolute;\n} \n\n#parent0:hover #child0 {\n  visibility: visible;\n  opacity: 1;\n  position: relative;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Works great as well.

Since its <code>rhs</code> argument is an <em>rvalue</em>, we know it's not needed any longer and we can steal its value.<br>\nSo the value is <strong><em>moved</em></strong> from the unnamed temporary returned from <code>f()</code> to <code>x</code> (while the data of <code>x</code>, initialized to an empty <code>X</code>, is moved into the temporary, which will get destroyed after the assignment). </p>\n", "title": "What are move semantics?", "answer_id": 3106219, "question_id": 3106110, "tags": ["c++", "c++-faq", "c++11", "move-semantics"]}, {"body": "<p>If you are really interested in a good, in-depth explanation of move semantics, I'd highly recommend reading the original paper on them, <a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2002/n1377.htm\">\"A Proposal to Add Move Semantics Support to the C++ Language.\"</a>  </p>\n\n<p>It's very accessible and easy to read and it makes an excellent case for the benefits that they offer.

Let's start with a very simple string class which only holds a pointer to a heap-allocated block of memory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;cstring&gt;\n#include &lt;algorithm&gt;\n\nclass string\n{\n    char* data;\n\npublic:\n\n    string(const char* p)\n    {\n        size_t size = strlen(p) + 1;\n        data = new char[size];\n        memcpy(data, p, size);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Since we chose to manage the memory ourselves, we need to follow the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28C++_programming%29\">rule of three</a>. I am going to defer writing the assignment operator and only implement the destructor and the copy constructor for now:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    ~string()\n    {\n        delete[] data;\n    }\n\n    string(const string&amp; that)\n    {\n        size_t size = strlen(that.data) + 1;\n        data = new char[size];\n        memcpy(data, that.data, size);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The copy constructor defines what it means to copy string objects. The parameter <code>const string&amp; that</code> binds to all expressions of type string which allows you to make copies in the following examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string a(x);                                    // Line 1\nstring b(x + y);                                // Line 2\nstring c(some_function_returning_a_string());   // Line 3\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now comes the key insight into move semantics. Note that only in the first line where we copy <code>x</code> is this deep copy really necessary, because we might want to inspect <code>x</code> later and would be very surprised if <code>x</code> had changed somehow. Did you notice how I just said <code>x</code> three times (four times if you include this sentence) and meant the <em>exact same object</em> every time? We call expressions such as <code>x</code> \"lvalues\".</p>\n\n<p>The arguments in lines 2 and 3 are not lvalues, but rvalues, because the underlying string objects have no names, so the client has no way to inspect them again at a later point in time.\nrvalues denote temporary objects which are destroyed at the next semicolon (to be more precise: at the end of the full-expression that lexically contains the rvalue). This is important because during the initialization of <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, we could do whatever we wanted with the source string, and <em>the client couldn't tell a difference</em>!</p>\n\n<p>C++0x introduces a new mechanism called \"rvalue reference\" which, among other things,\nallows us to detect rvalue arguments via function overloading. All we have to do is write a constructor with an rvalue reference parameter. Inside that constructor we can do <em>anything we want</em> with the source, as long as we leave it in <em>some</em> valid state:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    string(string&amp;&amp; that)   // string&amp;&amp; is an rvalue reference to a string\n    {\n        data = that.data;\n        that.data = nullptr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What have we done here? Instead of deeply copying the heap data, we have just copied the pointer and then set the original pointer to null. In effect, we have \"stolen\" the data that originally belonged to the source string. Again, the key insight is that under no circumstance could the client detect that the source had been modified. Since we don't really do a copy here, we call this constructor a \"move constructor\". Its job is to move resources from one object to another instead of copying them.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations, you now understand the basics of move semantics! Let's continue by implementing the assignment operator. If you're unfamiliar with the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3279543/what-is-the-copy-and-swap-idiom\">copy and swap idiom</a>, learn it and come back, because it's an awesome C++ idiom related to exception safety.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    string&amp; operator=(string that)\n    {\n        std::swap(data, that.data);\n        return *this;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Huh, that's it? \"Where's the rvalue reference?\" you might ask. \"We don't need it here!\" is my answer :)</p>\n\n<p>Note that we pass the parameter <code>that</code> <em>by value</em>, so <code>that</code> has to be initialized just like any other string object. Exactly how is <code>that</code> going to be initialized? In the olden days of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++#Standardization\">C++98</a>, the answer would have been \"by the copy constructor\". In C++0x, the compiler chooses between the copy constructor and the move constructor based on whether the argument to the assignment operator is an lvalue or an rvalue.</p>\n\n<p>So if you say <code>a = b</code>, the <em>copy constructor</em> will initialize <code>that</code> (because the expression <code>b</code> is an lvalue), and the assignment operator swaps the contents with a freshly created, deep copy. That is the very definition of the copy and swap idiom -- make a copy, swap the contents with the copy, and then get rid of the copy by leaving the scope. Nothing new here.</p>\n\n<p>But if you say <code>a = x + y</code>, the <em>move constructor</em> will initialize <code>that</code> (because the expression <code>x + y</code> is an rvalue), so there is no deep copy involved, only an efficient move.\n<code>that</code> is still an independent object from the argument, but its construction was trivial,\nsince the heap data didn't have to be copied, just moved. It wasn't necessary to copy it because <code>x + y</code> is an rvalue, and again, it is okay to move from string objects denoted by rvalues.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize, the copy constructor makes a deep copy, because the source must remain untouched.\nThe move constructor, on the other hand, can just copy the pointer and then set the pointer in the source to null. It is okay to \"nullify\" the source object in this manner, because the client has no way of inspecting the object again.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this example got the main point across. There is a lot more to rvalue references and move semantics which I intentionally left out to keep it simple.

Thank you very much, Stephan!</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>Move semantics allows an object, under certain conditions, to take ownership of some other object's external resources. This is important in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Turning expensive copies into cheap moves. See my first answer for an example. Note that if an object does not manage at least one external resource (either directly, or indirectly through its member objects), move semantics will not offer any advantages over copy semantics. In that case, copying an object and moving an object means the exact same thing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class cannot_benefit_from_move_semantics\n{\n    int a;        // moving an int means copying an int\n    float b;      // moving a float means copying a float\n    double c;     // moving a double means copying a double\n    char d[64];   // moving a char array means copying a char array\n\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Implementing safe \"move-only\" types; that is, types for which copying does not make sense, but moving does.  Examples include locks, file handles, and smart pointers with unique ownership semantics. Note: This answer discusses <code>std::auto_ptr</code>, a deprecated C++98 standard library template, which was replaced by <code>std::unique_ptr</code> in C++11. Intermediate C++ programmers are probably at least somewhat familiar with <code>std::auto_ptr</code>, and because of the \"move semantics\" it displays, it seems like a good starting point for discussing move semantics in C++11. YMMV.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>What is a move?</h2>\n\n<p>The C++98 standard library offers a smart pointer with unique ownership semantics called <code>std::auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code>. In case you are unfamiliar with <code>auto_ptr</code>, its purpose is to guarantee that a dynamically allocated object is always released, even in the face of exceptions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n    std::auto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; a(new Triangle);\n    // ...\n    // arbitrary code, could throw exceptions\n    // ...\n}   // &lt;--- when a goes out of scope, the triangle is deleted automatically\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The unusual thing about <code>auto_ptr</code> is its \"copying\" behavior:</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; a(new Triangle);\n\n      +---------------+\n      | triangle data |\n      +---------------+\n        ^\n        |\n        |\n        |\n  +-----|---+\n  |   +-|-+ |\na | p | | | |\n  |   +---+ |\n  +---------+\n\nauto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; b(a);\n\n      +---------------+\n      | triangle data |\n      +---------------+\n        ^\n        |\n        +----------------------+\n                               |\n  +---------+            +-----|---+\n  |   +---+ |            |   +-|-+ |\na | p |   | |          b | p | | | |\n  |   +---+ |            |   +---+ |\n  +---------+            +---------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note how the initialization of <code>b</code> with <code>a</code> does <em>not</em> copy the triangle, but instead transfers the ownership of the triangle from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code>. We also say \"<code>a</code> is <em>moved into</em> <code>b</code>\" or \"the triangle is <em>moved</em> from <code>a</code> <em>to</em> <code>b</code>\". This may sound confusing, because the triangle itself always stays at the same place in memory.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To move an object means to transfer ownership of some resource it manages to another object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The copy constructor of <code>auto_ptr</code> probably looks something like this (somewhat simplified):</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto_ptr(auto_ptr&amp; source)   // note the missing const\n{\n    p = source.p;\n    source.p = 0;   // now the source no longer owns the object\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Dangerous and harmless moves</h2>\n\n<p>The dangerous thing about <code>auto_ptr</code> is that what syntactically looks like a copy is actually a move. Trying to call a member function on a moved-from <code>auto_ptr</code> will invoke undefined behavior, so you have to be very careful not to use an <code>auto_ptr</code> after it has been moved from:</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; a(new Triangle);   // create triangle\nauto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; b(a);              // move a into b\ndouble area = a-&gt;area();           // undefined behavior\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But <code>auto_ptr</code> is not <em>always</em> dangerous. Factory functions are a perfectly fine use case for <code>auto_ptr</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; make_triangle()\n{\n    return auto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;(new Triangle);\n}\n\nauto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; c(make_triangle());      // move temporary into c\ndouble area = make_triangle()-&gt;area();   // perfectly safe\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note how both examples follow the same syntactic pattern:</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; variable(expression);\ndouble area = expression-&gt;area();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And yet, one of them invokes undefined behavior, whereas the other one does not. So what is the difference between the expressions <code>a</code> and <code>make_triangle()</code>? Aren't they both of the same type? Indeed they are, but they have different <em>value categories</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>Value categories</h2>\n\n<p>Obviously, there must be some profound difference between the expression <code>a</code> which denotes an <code>auto_ptr</code> variable, and the expression <code>make_triangle()</code> which denotes the call of a function that returns an <code>auto_ptr</code> by value, thus creating a fresh temporary <code>auto_ptr</code> object every time it is called. <code>a</code> is an example of an <em>lvalue</em>, whereas <code>make_triangle()</code> is an example of an <em>rvalue</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Moving from lvalues such as <code>a</code> is dangerous, because we could later try to call a member function via <code>a</code>, invoking undefined behavior. On the other hand, moving from rvalues such as <code>make_triangle()</code> is perfectly safe, because after the copy constructor has done its job, we cannot use the temporary again. There is no expression that denotes said temporary; if we simply write <code>make_triangle()</code> again, we get a <em>different</em> temporary. In fact, the moved-from temporary is already gone on the next line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>auto_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; c(make_triangle());\n                                  ^ the moved-from temporary dies right here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the letters <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> have a historic origin in the left-hand side and right-hand side of an assignment. This is no longer true in C++, because there are lvalues which cannot appear on the left-hand side of an assignment (like arrays or user-defined types without an assignment operator), and there are rvalues which can (all rvalues of class types with an assignment operator).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An rvalue of class type is an expression whose evaluation creates a temporary object.\n  Under normal circumstances, no other expression inside the same scope denotes the same temporary object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Rvalue references</h2>\n\n<p>We now understand that moving from lvalues is potentially dangerous, but moving from rvalues is harmless. If C++ had language support to distinguish lvalue arguments from rvalue arguments, we could either completely forbid moving from lvalues, or at least make moving from lvalues <em>explicit</em> at call site, so that we no longer move by accident.</p>\n\n<p>C++11's answer to this problem is <em>rvalue references</em>. An rvalue reference is a new kind of reference that only binds to rvalues, and the syntax is <code>X&amp;&amp;</code>. The good old reference <code>X&amp;</code> is now known as an <em>lvalue reference</em>. (Note that <code>X&amp;&amp;</code> is <em>not</em> a reference to a reference; there is no such thing in C++.)</p>\n\n<p>If we throw <code>const</code> into the mix, we already have four different kinds of references. What kinds of expressions of type <code>X</code> can they bind to?</p>\n\n<pre><code>            lvalue   const lvalue   rvalue   const rvalue\n---------------------------------------------------------              \nX&amp;          yes\nconst X&amp;    yes      yes            yes      yes\nX&amp;&amp;                                 yes\nconst X&amp;&amp;                           yes      yes\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In practice, you can forget about <code>const X&amp;&amp;</code>. Being restricted to read from rvalues is not very useful.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An rvalue reference <code>X&amp;&amp;</code> is a new kind of reference that only binds to rvalues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Implicit conversions</h2>\n\n<p>Rvalue references went through several versions. Since version 2.1, an rvalue reference <code>X&amp;&amp;</code> also binds to all value categories of a different type <code>Y</code>, provided there is an implicit conversion from <code>Y</code> to <code>X</code>. In that case, a temporary of type <code>X</code> is created, and the rvalue reference is bound to that temporary:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void some_function(std::string&amp;&amp; r);\n\nsome_function(\"hello world\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above example, <code>\"hello world\"</code> is an lvalue of type <code>const char[12]</code>. Since there is an implicit conversion from <code>const char[12]</code> through <code>const char*</code> to <code>std::string</code>, a temporary of type <code>std::string</code> is created, and <code>r</code> is bound to that temporary. This is one of the cases where the distinction between rvalues (expressions) and temporaries (objects) is a bit blurry.</p>\n\n<h2>Move constructors</h2>\n\n<p>A useful example of a function with an <code>X&amp;&amp;</code> parameter is the <em>move constructor</em> <code>X::X(X&amp;&amp; source)</code>. Its purpose is to transfer ownership of the managed resource from the source into the current object.</p>\n\n<p>In C++11, <code>std::auto_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> has been replaced by <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code> which takes advantage of rvalue references. I will develop and discuss a simplified version of <code>unique_ptr</code>. First, we encapsulate a raw pointer and overload the operators <code>-&gt;</code> and <code>*</code>, so our class feels like a pointer:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;\nclass unique_ptr\n{\n    T* ptr;\n\npublic:\n\n    T* operator-&gt;() const\n    {\n        return ptr;\n    }\n\n    T&amp; operator*() const\n    {\n        return *ptr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The constructor takes ownership of the object, and the destructor deletes it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    explicit unique_ptr(T* p = nullptr)\n    {\n        ptr = p;\n    }\n\n    ~unique_ptr()\n    {\n        delete ptr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now comes the interesting part, the move constructor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    unique_ptr(unique_ptr&amp;&amp; source)   // note the rvalue reference\n    {\n        ptr = source.ptr;\n        source.ptr = nullptr;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This move constructor does exactly what the <code>auto_ptr</code> copy constructor did, but it can only be supplied with rvalues:</p>\n\n<pre><code>unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; a(new Triangle);\nunique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; b(a);                 // error\nunique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; c(make_triangle());   // okay\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The second line fails to compile, because <code>a</code> is an lvalue, but the parameter <code>unique_ptr&amp;&amp; source</code> can only be bound to rvalues. This is exactly what we wanted; dangerous moves should never be implicit. The third line compiles just fine, because <code>make_triangle()</code> is an rvalue. The move constructor will transfer ownership from the temporary to <code>c</code>. Again, this is exactly what we wanted.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The move constructor transfers ownership of a managed resource into the current object.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Move assignment operators</h2>\n\n<p>The last missing piece is the move assignment operator. Its job is to release the old resource and acquire the new resource from its argument:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    unique_ptr&amp; operator=(unique_ptr&amp;&amp; source)   // note the rvalue reference\n    {\n        if (this != &amp;source)    // beware of self-assignment\n        {\n            delete ptr;         // release the old resource\n\n            ptr = source.ptr;   // acquire the new resource\n            source.ptr = nullptr;\n        }\n        return *this;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note how this implementation of the move assignment operator duplicates logic of both the destructor and the move constructor. Are you familiar with the copy-and-swap idiom? It can also be applied to move semantics as the move-and-swap idiom:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    unique_ptr&amp; operator=(unique_ptr source)   // note the missing reference\n    {\n        std::swap(ptr, source.ptr);\n        return *this;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that <code>source</code> is a variable of type <code>unique_ptr</code>, it will be initialized by the move constructor; that is, the argument will be moved into the parameter. The argument is still required to be an rvalue, because the move constructor itself has an rvalue reference parameter. When control flow reaches the closing brace of <code>operator=</code>, <code>source</code> goes out of scope, releasing the old resource automatically.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The move assignment operator transfers ownership of a managed resource into the current object, releasing the old resource.\n  The move-and-swap idiom simplifies the implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Moving from lvalues</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes, we want to move from lvalues. That is, sometimes we want the compiler to treat an lvalue as if it were an rvalue, so it can invoke the move constructor, even though it could be potentially unsafe.\nFor this purpose, C++11 offers a standard library function template called <code>std::move</code> inside the header <code>&lt;utility&gt;</code>.\nThis name is a bit unfortunate, because <code>std::move</code> simply casts an lvalue to an rvalue; it does <em>not</em> move anything by itself. It merely <em>enables</em> moving. Maybe it should have been named <code>std::cast_to_rvalue</code> or <code>std::enable_move</code>, but we are stuck with the name by now.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how you explicitly move from an lvalue:</p>\n\n<pre><code>unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; a(new Triangle);\nunique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; b(a);              // still an error\nunique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; c(std::move(a));   // okay\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that after the third line, <code>a</code> no longer owns a triangle. That's okay, because by <em>explicitly</em> writing <code>std::move(a)</code>, we made our intentions clear: \"Dear constructor, do whatever you want with <code>a</code> in order to initialize <code>c</code>; I don't care about <code>a</code> anymore. Feel free to have your way with <code>a</code>.\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>std::move(some_lvalue)</code> casts an lvalue to an rvalue, thus enabling a subsequent move.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Xvalues</h2>\n\n<p>Note that even though <code>std::move(a)</code> is an rvalue, its evaluation does <em>not</em> create a temporary object. This conundrum forced the committee to introduce a third value category. Something that can be bound to an rvalue reference, even though it is not an rvalue in the traditional sense, is called an <em>xvalue</em> (eXpiring value). The traditional rvalues were renamed to <em>prvalues</em> (Pure rvalues).</p>\n\n<p>Both prvalues and xvalues are rvalues. Xvalues and lvalues are both <em>glvalues</em> (Generalized lvalues). The relationships are easier to grasp with a diagram:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        expressions\n          /     \\\n         /       \\\n        /         \\\n    glvalues   rvalues\n      /  \\       /  \\\n     /    \\     /    \\\n    /      \\   /      \\\nlvalues   xvalues   prvalues\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that only xvalues are really new; the rest is just due to renaming and grouping.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>C++98 rvalues are known as prvalues in C++11. Mentally replace all occurrences of \"rvalue\" in the preceding paragraphs with \"prvalue\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Moving out of functions</h2>\n\n<p>So far, we have seen movement into local variables, and into function parameters. But moving is also possible in the opposite direction. If a function returns by value, some object at call site (probably a local variable or a temporary, but could be any kind of object) is initialized with the expression after the <code>return</code> statement as an argument to the move constructor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; make_triangle()\n{\n    return unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;(new Triangle);\n}          \\-----------------------------/\n                  |\n                  | temporary is moved into c\n                  |\n                  v\nunique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; c(make_triangle());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, automatic objects (local variables that are not declared as <code>static</code>) can also be <em>implicitly</em> moved out of functions:</p>\n\n<pre><code>unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; make_square()\n{\n    unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; result(new Square);\n    return result;   // note the missing std::move\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How come the move constructor accepts the lvalue <code>result</code> as an argument? The scope of <code>result</code> is about to end, and it will be destroyed during stack unwinding. Nobody could possibly complain afterwards that <code>result</code> had changed somehow; when control flow is back at the caller, <code>result</code> does not exist anymore! For that reason, C++11 has a special rule that allows returning automatic objects from functions without having to write <code>std::move</code>. In fact, you should <em>never</em> use <code>std::move</code> to move automatic objects out of functions, as this inhibits the \"named return value optimization\" (NRVO).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Never use <code>std::move</code> to move automatic objects out of functions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that in both factory functions, the return type is a value, not an rvalue reference. Rvalue references are still references, and as always, you should never return a reference to an automatic object; the caller would end up with a dangling reference if you tricked the compiler into accepting your code, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;&amp;&amp; flawed_attempt()   // DO NOT DO THIS!\n{\n    unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; very_bad_idea(new Square);\n    return std::move(very_bad_idea);   // WRONG!\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Never return automatic objects by rvalue reference. Moving is exclusively performed by the move constructor, not by <code>std::move</code>, and not by merely binding an rvalue to an rvalue reference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Moving into members</h2>\n\n<p>Sooner or later, you are going to write code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Foo\n{\n    unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; member;\n\npublic:\n\n    Foo(unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;&amp;&amp; parameter)\n    : member(parameter)   // error\n    {}\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically, the compiler will complain that <code>parameter</code> is an lvalue. If you look at its type, you see an rvalue reference, but an rvalue reference simply means \"a reference that is bound to an rvalue\"; it does <em>not</em> mean that the reference itself is an rvalue! Indeed, <code>parameter</code> is just an ordinary variable with a name. You can use <code>parameter</code> as often as you like inside the body of the constructor, and it always denotes the same object. Implicitly moving from it would be dangerous, hence the language forbids it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A named rvalue reference is an lvalue, just like any other variable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The solution is to manually enable the move:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Foo\n{\n    unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; member;\n\npublic:\n\n    Foo(unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;&amp;&amp; parameter)\n    : member(std::move(parameter))   // note the std::move\n    {}\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You could argue that <code>parameter</code> is not used anymore after the initialization of <code>member</code>. Why is there no special rule to silently insert <code>std::move</code> just as with return values? Probably because it would be too much burden on the compiler implementors. For example, what if the constructor body was in another translation unit? By contrast, the return value rule simply has to check the symbol tables to determine whether or not the identifier after the <code>return</code> keyword denotes an automatic object.</p>\n\n<p>You can also pass <code>parameter</code> by value. For move-only types like <code>unique_ptr</code>, it seems there is no established idiom yet. Personally, I prefer pass by value, as it causes less clutter in the interface.</p>\n\n<h2>Special member functions</h2>\n\n<p>C++98 implicitly declares three special member functions on demand, that is, when they are needed somewhere: the copy constructor, the copy assignment operator and the destructor.</p>\n\n<pre><code>X::X(const X&amp;);              // copy constructor\nX&amp; X::operator=(const X&amp;);   // copy assignment operator\nX::~X();                     // destructor\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Rvalue references went through several versions. Since version 3.0, C++11 declares two additional special member functions on demand: the move constructor and the move assignment operator. Note that neither VC10 nor VC11 conform to version 3.0 yet, so you will have to implement them yourself.</p>\n\n<pre><code>X::X(X&amp;&amp;);                   // move constructor\nX&amp; X::operator=(X&amp;&amp;);        // move assignment operator\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These two new special member functions are only implicitly declared if none of the special member functions are declared manually. Also, if you declare your own move constructor or move assignment operator, neither the copy constructor nor the copy assignment operator will be declared implicitly.</p>\n\n<p>What do these rules mean in practice?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you write a class without unmanaged resources, there is no need to declare any of the five special member functions yourself, and you will get correct copy semantics and move semantics for free. Otherwise, you will have to implement the special member functions yourself. Of course, if your class does not benefit from move semantics, there is no need to implement the special move operations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the copy assignment operator and the move assignment operator can be fused into a single, unified assignment operator, taking its argument by value:</p>\n\n<pre><code>X&amp; X::operator=(X source)    // unified assignment operator\n{\n    swap(source);            // see my first answer for an explanation\n    return *this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way, the number of special member functions to implement drops from five to four. There is a tradeoff between exception-safety and efficiency here, but I am not an expert on this issue.</p>\n\n<h2>Forwarding references (<a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4164.pdf\">previously</a> known as <em>Universal references</em>)</h2>\n\n<p>Consider the following function template:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;\nvoid foo(T&amp;&amp;);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You might expect <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> to only bind to rvalues, because at first glance, it looks like an rvalue reference. As it turns out though, <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> also binds to lvalues:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo(make_triangle());   // T is unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;, T&amp;&amp; is unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;&amp;&amp;\nunique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt; a(new Triangle);\nfoo(a);                 // T is unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;&amp;, T&amp;&amp; is unique_ptr&lt;Shape&gt;&amp;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the argument is an rvalue of type <code>X</code>, <code>T</code> is deduced to be <code>X</code>, hence <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> means <code>X&amp;&amp;</code>. This is what anyone would expect.\nBut if the argument is an lvalue of type <code>X</code>, due to a special rule, <code>T</code> is deduced to be <code>X&amp;</code>, hence <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> would mean something like <code>X&amp; &amp;&amp;</code>. But since C++ still has no notion of references to references, the type <code>X&amp; &amp;&amp;</code> is <em>collapsed</em> into <code>X&amp;</code>. This may sound confusing and useless at first, but reference collapsing is essential for <em>perfect forwarding</em> (which will not be discussed here).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>T&amp;&amp; is not an rvalue reference, but a forwarding reference. It also binds to lvalues, in which case <code>T</code> and <code>T&amp;&amp;</code> are both lvalue references.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you want to constrain a function template to rvalues, you can combine <a href=\"http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae\">SFINAE</a> with type traits:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;type_traits&gt;\n\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt;\ntypename std::enable_if&lt;std::is_rvalue_reference&lt;T&amp;&amp;&gt;::value, void&gt;::type\nfoo(T&amp;&amp;);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Implementation of move</h2>\n\n<p>Now that you understand reference collapsing, here is how <code>std::move</code> is implemented:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;\ntypename std::remove_reference&lt;T&gt;::type&amp;&amp;\nmove(T&amp;&amp; t)\n{\n    return static_cast&lt;typename std::remove_reference&lt;T&gt;::type&amp;&amp;&gt;(t);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, <code>move</code> accepts any kind of parameter thanks to the forwarding reference <code>T&amp;&amp;</code>, and it returns an rvalue reference. The <code>std::remove_reference&lt;T&gt;::type</code> meta-function call is necessary because otherwise, for lvalues of type <code>X</code>, the return type would be <code>X&amp; &amp;&amp;</code>, which would collapse into <code>X&amp;</code>. Since <code>t</code> is always an lvalue (remember that a named rvalue reference is an lvalue), but we want to bind <code>t</code> to an rvalue reference, we have to explicitly cast <code>t</code> to the correct return type.\nThe call of a function that returns an rvalue reference is itself an xvalue. Now you know where xvalues come from ;)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The call of a function that returns an rvalue reference, such as <code>std::move</code>, is an xvalue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that returning by rvalue reference is fine in this example, because <code>t</code> does not denote an automatic object, but instead an object that was passed in by the caller.</p>\n", "title": "What are move semantics?", "answer_id": 11540204, "question_id": 3106110, "tags": ["c++", "c++-faq", "c++11", "move-semantics"]}, {"body": "<p>In easy (practical) terms:</p>\n\n<p>Copying an object means copying its \"static\" members and calling the <code>new</code> operator for its dynamic objects. Right?</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A\n{\n   int i, *p;\n\npublic:\n   A(const A&amp; a) : i(a.i), p(new int(*a.p)) {}\n   ~A() { delete p; }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, to <strong>move</strong> an object (I repeat, in a practical point of view) implies only to copy the pointers of dynamic objects, and not to create new ones.</p>\n\n<p>But, is that not dangerous? Of course, you could destruct a dynamic object twice (segmentation fault). So, to avoid that, you should \"invalidate\" the source pointers to avoid destructing them twice:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class A\n{\n   int i, *p;\n\npublic:\n   // Movement of an object inside a copy constructor.\n   A(const A&amp; a) : i(a.i), p(a.p)\n   {\n     a.p = nullptr; // pointer invalidated.\n   }\n\n   ~A() { delete p; }\n   // Deleting NULL, 0 or nullptr (address 0x0) is safe. \n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ok, but if I move an object, the source object becomes useless, no? Of course, but in certain situations that's very useful. The most evident one is when I call a function with an anonymous object (temporal, rvalue object, ..., you can call it with different names):</p>\n\n<pre><code>void heavyFunction(HeavyType());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In that situation, an anonymous object is created, next copied to the function parameter, and afterwards deleted. So, here it is better to move the object, because you don't need the anonymous object and you can save time and memory.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to the concept of an \"rvalue\" reference. They exist in C++11 only to detect if the received object is anonymous or not. I think you do already know that an \"lvalue\" is an assignable entity (the left part of the <code>=</code> operator), so you need a named reference to an object to be capable to act as an lvalue. A rvalue is exactly the opposite, an object with no named references. Because of that, anonymous object and rvalue are synonyms. So: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class A\n{\n   int i, *p;\n\npublic:\n   // Copy\n   A(const A&amp; a) : i(a.i), p(new int(*a.p)) {}\n\n   // Movement (&amp;&amp; means \"rvalue reference to\")\n   A(A&amp;&amp; a) : i(a.i), p(a.p)\n   {\n      a.p = nullptr;\n   }\n\n   ~A() { delete p; }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case, when an object of type <code>A</code> should be \"copied\", the compiler creates a lvalue reference or a rvalue reference according to if the passed object is named or not. When not, your move-constructor is called and you know the object is temporal and you can move its dynamic objects instead of copying them, saving space and memory.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to remember that \"static\" objects are always copied. There's no ways to \"move\" a static object (object in stack and not on heap). So, the distinction \"move\"/ \"copy\" when an object has no dynamic members (directly or indirectly) is irrelevant.</p>\n\n<p>If your object is complex and the destructor has other secondary effects, like calling to a library's function, calling to other global functions or whatever it is, perhaps is better to signal a movement with a flag:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Heavy\n{\n   bool b_moved;\n   // staff\n\npublic:\n   A(const A&amp; a) { /* definition */ }\n   A(A&amp;&amp; a) : // initialization list\n   {\n      a.b_moved = true;\n   }\n\n   ~A() { if (!b_moved) /* destruct object */ }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, your code is shorter (you don't need to do a <code>nullptr</code> assignment for each dynamic member) and more general.</p>\n\n<p>Other typical question: what is the difference between <code>A&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>const A&amp;&amp;</code>? Of course, in the first case, you can modify the object and in the second not, but, practical meaning? In the second case, you can't modify it, so you have no ways to invalidate the object (except with a mutable flag or something like that), and there is no practical difference to a copy constructor.</p>\n\n<p>And what is <strong>perfect forwarding</strong>? It is important to know that a \"rvalue reference\" is a reference to a named object in the \"caller's scope\". But in the actual scope, a rvalue reference is a name to an object, so, it acts as a named object. If you pass an rvalue reference to another function, you are passing a named object, so, the object isn't received like a temporal object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>void some_function(A&amp;&amp; a)\n{\n   other_function(a);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The object <code>a</code> would be copied to the actual parameter of <code>other_function</code>. If you want the object <code>a</code> continues being treated as a temporary object, you should use the <code>std::move</code> function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>other_function(std::move(a));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this line, <code>std::move</code> will cast <code>a</code> to an rvalue and <code>other_function</code> will receive the object as a unnamed object. Of course, if <code>other_function</code> has not specific overloading to work with unnamed objects, this distinction is not important.</p>\n\n<p>Is that perfect forwarding? Not, but we are very close. Perfect forwarding is only useful to work with templates, with the purpose to say: if I need to pass an object to another function, I need that if I receive a named object, the object is passed as a named object, and when not, I want to pass it like a unnamed object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;\nvoid some_function(T&amp;&amp; a)\n{\n   other_function(std::forward&lt;T&gt;(a));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's the signature of a prototypical function that uses perfect forwarding, implemented in C++11 by means of <code>std::forward</code>. This function exploits some rules of template instantiation:</p>\n\n<pre><code> `A&amp; &amp;&amp; == A&amp;`\n `A&amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; == A&amp;&amp;`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, if <code>T</code> is a lvalue reference to <code>A</code> (<strong>T</strong> = A&amp;), <code>a</code> also (<strong>A&amp;</strong> &amp;&amp; => A&amp;). If <code>T</code> is a rvalue reference to <code>A</code>, <code>a</code> also (A&amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; => A&amp;&amp;). In both cases, <code>a</code> is a named object in the actual scope, but <code>T</code> contains the information of its \"reference type\" from the caller scope's point of view. This information (<code>T</code>) is passed as template parameter to <code>forward</code> and 'a' is moved or not according to the type of <code>T</code>.</p>\n", "title": "What are move semantics?", "answer_id": 18300974, "question_id": 3106110, "tags": ["c++", "c++-faq", "c++11", "move-semantics"]}, {"body": "<p>To illustrate the need for <em>move semantics</em>, let's consider this example without move semantics:</p>\n\n<p>Here's a function that takes an object of type <code>T</code> and returns an object of the same type <code>T</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>T f(T o) { return o; }\n  //^^^ new object constructed\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above function uses <em>call by value</em> which means that when this function is called an object must be <em>constructed</em> to be used by the function.<br>\nBecause the function also <em>returns by value</em>, another new object is constructed for the return value:</p>\n\n<pre><code>T b = f(a);\n  //^ new object constructed\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Two</strong> new objects have been constructed, one of which is a temporary object that's only used for the duration of the function.</p>\n\n<p>When the new object is created from the return value, the copy constructor is called to <em>copy</em> the contents of the temporary object to the new object b.

In fact, standard containers typically rely on std::move_if_noexcept to choose between move and copy when container elements need to be relocated.\n  If both copy and move constructors are provided, overload resolution selects the move constructor if the argument is an rvalue (either a prvalue such as a nameless temporary or an xvalue such as the result of std::move), and selects the copy constructor if the argument is an lvalue (named object or a function/operator returning lvalue reference). If only the copy constructor is provided, all argument categories select it (as long as it takes a reference to const, since rvalues can bind to const references), which makes copying the fallback for moving, when moving is unavailable.\n  In many situations, move constructors are optimized out even if they would produce observable side-effects, see copy elision.\n  A constructor is called a 'move constructor' when it takes an rvalue reference as a parameter. It is not obligated to move anything, the class is not required to have a resource to be moved and a 'move constructor' may not be able to move a resource as in the allowable (but maybe not sensible) case where the parameter is a const rvalue reference (const T&amp;&amp;).</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "What are move semantics?", "answer_id": 35615694, "question_id": 3106110, "tags": ["c++", "c++-faq", "c++11", "move-semantics"]}], "question_id": 3106110}, {"body": "<p>How can I rotate the Android emulator display to see it in landscape mode?</p>\n", "title": "How to rotate the Android emulator display?", "tags": ["android", "android-emulator", "emulator"], "answer_count": 24, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4535298/how-to-rotate-the-android-emulator-display", "answers": [{"body": "<ul>\n<li><strong>Linux:</strong> <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd> </li>\n<li><strong>Mac:</strong> <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd></li>\n<li><strong>Windows:</strong> <kbd>Left CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F11</kbd> or <kbd>Left CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd> </li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "How to rotate the Android emulator display?", "answer_id": 4535312, "question_id": 4535298, "tags": ["android", "android-emulator", "emulator"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>Windows:</strong> <kbd>left Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mac:</strong> <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd></p>\n\n<p>See the possible options <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html#KeyMapping\">here</a></p>\n", "title": "How to rotate the Android emulator display?", "answer_id": 4535315, "question_id": 4535298, "tags": ["android", "android-emulator", "emulator"]}, {"body": "<p>As far as i know, <kbd>F11</kbd> or <kbd>F12</kbd> doesnt work, and nor does <kbd>Right Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd>.</p>\n\n<p>Hit <kbd>Left Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd> , or <kbd>Home</kbd>, or <kbd>PageUp</kbd>, (not <kbd>NUMPAD 7</kbd> or <kbd>NUMPAD 9</kbd> like <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html\">the website</a> says) to rotate emulator.</p>\n", "title": "How to rotate the Android emulator display?", "answer_id": 5334706, "question_id": 4535298, "tags": ["android", "android-emulator", "emulator"]}, {"body": "<p>On Mac OS X, you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Fn</kbd> + <kbd>F12</kbd> to rotate the Android emulator if you have have not configured your keyboard to \"Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys\" (Check it on System Preferences -

Why is this?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><code>my_list</code> is a pointer to the actual list in memory. When you say <code>new_list = my_list</code> you're not making a copy, you're just adding another name that points at that original list in memory. We can have similar issues when we make copies of lists. </p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [[], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy = l[:]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy\n[[], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy[0].append('foo')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy\n[['foo'], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l\n[['foo'], [], []]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The list is just an array of pointers to the contents, so a shallow copy just copies the pointers, and so you have two different lists, but they have the same contents. To make copies of the contents, you need a deep copy.</p>\n\n<h2>Deep copies</h2>\n\n<p>To make a <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/library/copy.html\">deep copy of a list, in Python 2 or 3, use <code>deepcopy</code> in the <code>copy</code> module</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import copy\na_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(a_list)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To demonstrate how this allows us to make new sub-lists:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l\n[['foo'], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(l)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_deep_copy[0].pop()\n'foo'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_deep_copy\n[[], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l\n[['foo'], [], []]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And so we see that the deep copied list is an entirely different list from the original. You could roll your own function - but don't. You're likely to create bugs you otherwise wouldn't have by using the standard library's deepcopy function.</p>\n\n<h2>Don't use <code>eval</code></h2>\n\n<p>You may see this used as a way to deepcopy, but don't do it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>problematic_deep_copy = eval(repr(a_list))\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It's dangerous, particularly if you're evaluating something from a source you don't trust.</li>\n<li>It's not reliable, if a subelement you're copying doesn't have a representation that can be eval'd to reproduce an equivalent element.</li>\n<li>It's also less performant. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In 64 bit Python 2.7:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = range(10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: copy.deepcopy(l)))\n27.55826997756958\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: eval(repr(l))))\n29.04534101486206\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>on 64 bit Python 3.5:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = list(range(10))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: copy.deepcopy(l)))\n16.84255409205798\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: eval(repr(l))))\n34.813894678023644\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to clone or copy a list in Python?", "answer_id": 26562235, "question_id": 2612802, "tags": ["python", "list", "copy", "clone"]}, {"body": "<p>There are many answers already that tell you how to make a proper copy, but none of them say why your original 'copy' failed. </p>\n\n<p>Python doesn't store values in variables; it binds names to objects.

While <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/218196/felix-kling\">Felix Kling</a> refers to it in his answer, there is a little bit more to the issue and possibly a workaround using built-ins that might prove a faster alternative to <code>deepcopy</code>.</p>\n\n<p>While <code>new_list = old_list[:]</code>, <code>copy.copy(old_list)'</code> and for Py3k <code>old_list.copy()</code> work for single-leveled lists, they revert to pointing at the <code>list</code> objects nested within the <code>old_list</code> and the <code>new_list</code>, and changes to one of the <code>list</code> objects are perpetuated in the other. </p>\n\n<h1>Edit: New information brought to light</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As was pointed out by both <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/541136/aaron-hall\">Aaron Hall</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/4014959/pm-2ring\">PM 2Ring</a> <strong>using <code>eval()</code> is not only a bad idea, it is also much slower than <code>copy.deepcopy()</code>.</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>This means that for multidimensional lists, the only option is <code>copy.deepcopy()</code>. With that being said, it really isn't an option as the performance goes way south when you try to use it on a moderately sized multidimensional array.  I tried to <code>timeit</code> using a 42x42 array, not unheard of or even that large for bioinformatics applications, and I gave up on waiting for a response and just started typing my edit to this post.</p>\n  \n  <p>It would seem that the only real option then is to initialize multiple lists and work on them independently. If anyone has any other suggestions, for how to handle multidimensional list copying, it would be appreciated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As others have stated, there <strike>can be</strike> <strong><em>are significant</em></strong> performance issues using the <code>copy</code> module and <code>copy.deepcopy</code> <strong><em>for multidimensional lists</em></strong>. <strike> Trying to work out a different way of copying the multidimensional list without using <code>deepcopy</code>, (I was working on a problem for a course that only allows 5 seconds for the entire algorithm to run in order to receive credit), I came up with a way of using built-in functions to make a copy of the nested list without having them point at one another or at the <code>list</code> objects nested within them. I used <code>eval()</code> and <code>repr()</code> in the assignment to make the copy of the old list into the new list without creating a link to the old list. It takes the form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>new_list = eval(repr(old_list))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically what this does is make a representation of <code>old_list</code> as a string and then evaluates the string as if it were the object that the string represents. By doing this, no link to the original <code>list</code> object is made. A new <code>list</code> object is created and each variable points to its own independent object. Here is an example using a 2 dimensional nested list.</p>\n\n<pre><code>old_list = [[0 for j in range(y)] for i in range(x)] # initialize (x,y) nested list\n\n# assign a copy of old_list to new list without them pointing to the same list object\nnew_list = eval(repr(old_list)) \n\n# make a change to new_list \nfor j in range(y):\n    for i in range(x):\n    new_list[i][j] += 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you then check the contents of each list, for example a 4 by 3 list, Python will return </p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; new_list\n\n[[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]]\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; old_list\n\n[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While this probably isn't the canonical or syntactically correct way to do it, it seems to work well. I haven't tested performance, but I am going to guess that <code>eval()</code> and <code>rep()</code> will have less overhead to run than <code>deepcopy</code> will. </strike></p>\n", "title": "How to clone or copy a list in Python?", "answer_id": 31332158, "question_id": 2612802, "tags": ["python", "list", "copy", "clone"]}], "question_id": 2612802}, {"body": "<p>How can I view any local commits I've made, that haven't yet been pushed to the remote repository?

If you see almost everyone has suggested to use the Random class and some have suggested to use the RNG crypto class. But then when to choose what. </p>\n\n<p>For that we need to first understand the term RANDOMNESS and the philosophy behind it.</p>\n\n<p>I would encourage you to watch this video which goes in depth in the philosophy of RANDOMNESS using C# <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCYxc-2-3fY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCYxc-2-3fY</a> </p>\n\n<p>First thing let us understand the philosophy of RANDOMNESS.  When we tell a person to choose between RED ,  GREEN and YELLOW  what happens internally. What makes a person choose RED or YELLO or GREEN ?. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nsoQL.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nsoQL.png\" alt=\"c# Random\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Some initial thought goes in to the persons mind which decides his choice , it can be favorite color , lucky color and so on. In other words some initial trigger which we term in RANDOM as SEED.This SEED is the beginning point , the trigger which instigates him to select the RANDOM value.</p>\n\n<p>Now if a SEED is easy to guess then those kind of random numbers are termed as <strong>PSEUDO</strong> and when a seed is difficult to guess those random numbers are termed  <strong>SECURED</strong> random numbers. </p>\n\n<p>For example a person chooses is color depending on weather and sound combination then  it would be difficult to guess the initial seed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vQ9y5.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/vQ9y5.png\" alt=\"c# Random\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Now let me make an important statement:-</p>\n\n<p>*\u201cRandom\u201d class generates only PSEUDO random number and to generate SECURE random number we need to use \u201cRNGCryptoServiceProvider\u201d class.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JJ93T.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/JJ93T.png\" alt=\"c# Random\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Random class takes seed values from your CPU clock which is very much predictable.  So in other words RANDOM class of C# generates pseudo random numbers , below is the code for the same.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Random rnd= new Random();\nint rndnumber = rnd.Next()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While the RNGCryptoServiceProvider  class uses OS entropy to generate seeds. OS entropy is a random value which is generated using sound , mouse click  and keyboard timings , thermal temp etc. Below goes the code for the same.</p>\n\n<pre><code>using (RNGCryptoServiceProvider rg = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider()) \n{ \nbyte[] rno = new byte[5];    \nrn.GetBytes(rno);    \nint randomvalue = BitConverter.ToInt32(rno, 0); \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To understand OS entropy see this video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCYxc-2-3fY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCYxc-2-3fY</a>   from 11:20 where the logic of OS entropy is explained.

For example, if a library wants to stream any object you pass into it, it knows it can because your object is serializable (assuming the lib requires your objects be proper JavaBeans). </p>\n", "title": "What is a JavaBean exactly?", "answer_id": 3295517, "question_id": 3295496, "tags": ["java", "javabeans", "serializable"]}, {"body": "<p>There's a term for it to make it sound special.

For other symbols, the same three options exist. Some even have a fourth option, allowing you to use a string based reference (eg. <code>&amp;hearts;</code> to display \u2665).</p>\n\n<p>You can use a reference website like <strong><a href=\"http://unicode-table.com/en/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unicode-table.com</a></strong> to find which icons are supported in UNICODE and which codes they correspond with.

For symbols like \u2603,\u2744,\u2605,\u2602,\u262d,\u2397 or \u2398, this is far less likely to be the case.

To decide which to pick, consider the following differences:</p>\n\n<p><strong>SVG images</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They can have multiple colors</li>\n<li>They can embed their own CSS and/or be styled by the HTML document</li>\n<li>They can be loaded as a seperate file, embedded in CSS AND embedded in HTML</li>\n<li>Each symbol is represented by XML code or base64 code. You cannot use the character directly within your code editor or use an HTML entity</li>\n<li>Multiple uses of the same symbol implies duplication of the symbol when XML code is embedded in the HTML. Duplication is not required when embedding the file in the CSS or loading it as a seperate file</li>\n<li>You can not use <code>color</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>background-color</code> or other font related styling rules to change the display of your icon, but you can reference different components of the icon as shapes individually.</li>\n<li>You need some knowledge of SVG and/or base64 encoding</li>\n<li>Limited or no support in old versions of IE</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Icon fonts</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An icon can have but one fill color, one background color, etc.</li>\n<li>An icon can be embedded in CSS or HTML. In HTML, you can use the character directly or use an HTML entity to represent it.</li>\n<li>Some symbols can be displayed without the use of a webfont. Most symbols cannot.</li>\n<li>Multiple uses of the same symbol implies duplication of the symbol when your character embedded in the HTML. Duplication is not required when embedding the file in the CSS.</li>\n<li>You can use <code>color</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>line-height</code>, <code>background-color</code> or other font related styling rules to change the display of your icon</li>\n<li>You need no special technical knowledge</li>\n<li>Support in all major browsers, including old versions of IE</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Personally, I would recommend the use of background-images only when you need multiple colors and those color can't be achieved by means of <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code> and other color-related CSS rules for fonts.</p>\n\n<p>The main benefit of using SVG images is that you can give different components of a symbol their own styling. If you embed your SVG XML code in the HTML document, this is very similar to styling the HTML. This would, however, result in a web page that uses both HTML tags and SVG tags, which could significantly reduce the readability of a webpage. It also adds extra bloat if the symbol is repeated across multiple pages and you need to consider that old versions of IE have no or limited support for SVG.</p>\n", "title": "What characters can be used for up/down triangle (arrow without stem) for display in HTML?", "answer_id": 27381342, "question_id": 2701192, "tags": ["html", "unicode", "icons", "ascii", "symbols"]}, {"body": "<p>A lot of people here are suggesting to use the triangles, but sometimes you need a chevron. </p>\n\n<p>We had a case where our button shows a chevron, and wanted the user's manual to refer to the button in a way which will be recognized by a non-technical user too.

But there is always the pause button to turn the podcast off when the user is done with it.  If I remember correctly, Listen, even puts a shortcut in the notification bar so you can always get to the pause button quickly.  Another example is an app like a twitter app for instance which constantly polls a service on the internet.  These types of apps should really allow the user to choose how often to poll the server, or whether even to poll in a background thread.</p>\n\n<p>If you need to have code that runs on exit, you can override onPause(), onStop(), or onDestroy() as appropriate.\n<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle\">http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle</a></p>\n", "title": "Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?", "answer_id": 2033970, "question_id": 2033914, "tags": ["android"]}, {"body": "<p>As an Application in an Android context is just a bunch of vaguely related Activities, quitting an Application doesn't really make much sense.

I have no intention of changing your mind -- rather, these are here for others who come to read this post in the future.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The point is that I cannot allow for\n  Android to determine when my app is\n  going to be terminated. that must be\n  the choice of the user.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Millions of people are perfectly happy with the model where the environment closes up the application as needed. Those users simply don't think about \"terminating\" the Android app, any more than they think about \"terminating\" a Web page or \"terminating\" a thermostat.</p>\n\n<p>iPhone users are much the same way, in that pressing the iPhone button does not necessarily \"feel\" like the app was terminated, since many iPhone apps pick up where the user left off, even if the app really was shut down (since iPhone only allows one third-party app at a time, at present).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As I said above, there is a lot of\n  things going on in my app (data being\n  PUSHed to the device, lists with tasks\n  that always should be there, etc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't know what \"lists with tasks that always should be there\" means, but the \"data being PUSHed to the device\" is a pleasant fiction and should not be done by an activity in any case. Use a scheduled task (via <code>AlarmManager</code>) to update your data for maximum reliability.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our users log in and can't be doing\n  that every time they get a phone call\n  and Android decides to kill the app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are many iPhone and Android applications that deal with this. Usually, it is because they hold onto logon credentials, rather than forcing users to log in every time manually.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, we want to check updates\n  when exiting the application</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is a mistake on any operating system. For all you know, the reason your application is being \"exited\" is because the OS is shutting down, and then your update process will fail mid-stream. Generally, that's not a good thing. Either check updates on start or check updates totally asynchronously (e.g., via a scheduled task), never on exit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some comments suggest that hitting the\n  back button does not kill the app at\n  all (see link in my question above).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pressing the BACK button does not \"kill the app\". It finishes the activity that was on-screen when the user pressed the BACK button.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It should only terminate when the\n  users wants to terminate it - never\n  ever any other way. If you can't write\n  apps that behave like that in Android,\n  then I think that Android can't be used\n  for writing real apps =(</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then neither can Web applications. Or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS\">WebOS</a>, if I understand their model correctly (haven't had a chance to play with one yet). In all of those, users don't \"terminate\" anything -- they just leave. iPhone is a bit different, in that it only presently allows one thing to run at a time (with a few exceptions), and so the act of leaving implies a fairly immediate termination of the app.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is there a way for me to really quit\n  the application?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As everybody else told you, users (via BACK) or your code (via <code>finish()</code>) can close up your currently-running activity. Users generally don't need anything else, for properly-written applications, any more than they need a \"quit\" option for using Web applications.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>No two application environments are the same, by definition. This means that you can see trends in environments as new ones arise and others get buried.</p>\n\n<p>For example, there is a growing movement to try to eliminate the notion of the \"file\". Most Web applications don't force users to think of files. iPhone apps typically don't force users to think of files. Android apps generally don't force users to think of files. And so on.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there is a growing movement to try to eliminate the notion of \"terminating\" an app. Most Web applications don't force the user to log out, but rather implicitly log the user out after a period of inactivity. Same thing with Android, and to a lesser extent, iPhone (and possibly WebOS).</p>\n\n<p>This requires more emphasis on application design, focusing on business goals and not sticking with an implementation model tied to a previous application environment. Developers who lack the time or inclination to do this will get frustrated with newer environments that break their existing mental model. This is not the fault of either environment, any more than it is the fault of a mountain for storms flowing around it rather than through it.</p>\n\n<p>For example, some development environments, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard\">Hypercard</a> and Smalltalk, had the application and the development tools co-mingled in one setup. This concept did not catch on much, outside of language extensions to apps (e.g., <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications\">VBA</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel\">Excel</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoLISP\">Lisp in AutoCAD</a>). Developers who came up with mental models that presumed the existence of development tools in the app itself, therefore, either had to change their model or limit themselves to environments where their model would hold true.</p>\n\n<p>So, when you write:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Along with other messy things I\n  discovered, I think that developing\n  our app for Android is not going to\n  happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That would appear to be for the best, for you, for right now. Similarly, I would counsel you against attempting to port your application to the Web, since some of the same problems you have reported with Android you will find in Web applications as well (e.g., no \"termination\"). Or, conversely, someday if you <em>do</em> port your app to the Web, you may find that the Web application's flow may be a better match for Android, and you can revisit an Android port at that time.</p>\n", "title": "Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?", "answer_id": 2034238, "question_id": 2033914, "tags": ["android"]}, {"body": "<p>Ted,\nWhat you are trying to accomplish can be done, perhaps just not how you are thinking of it right now.

Of course do it only in the case where you want to \"really end the app\", because the <code>onDestroy()</code> is part of the normal lifecycle of activities and not an app end at all.</p>\n", "title": "Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?", "answer_id": 2217252, "question_id": 2033914, "tags": ["android"]}, {"body": "<p>I'd just like to add a correction here for the future readers of this thread.  This particular nuance has escaped my understanding for a long time so I want to make sure none of you make the same mistakes:</p>\n\n<p><strong><code>System.exit()</code> does not kill your app if you have more than one activity on the stack.</strong>  What actually happens is that <strong>the process is killed and immediately restarted</strong> with one fewer activity on the stack.  This is also what happens when your app is killed by the Force Close dialog, or even when you try to kill the process from DDMS.  This is a fact that is entirely undocumented, to my knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is, if you want to exit your application, you've got to keep track of all activities in your stack and <code>finish()</code> ALL of them when the user wants to exit (and no, there is no way to iterate through the Activity stack, so you have to manage all of this yourself).  Even this does not actually kill the process or any dangling references you may have.  It simply finishes the activities.  Also, I'm not sure whether <code>Process.killProcess(Process.myPid())</code> works any better; I haven't tested it.</p>\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, it is okay for you to have activities remaining in your stack, there is another method which makes things super easy for you: <code>Activity.moveTaskToBack(true)</code> will simply background your process and show the home screen.</p>\n\n<p>The long answer involves explanation of the philosophy behind this behavior.  The philosophy is born out of a number of assumptions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First of all, this only happens when your app is in the foreground.  If it is in the background the process will terminate just fine.  However, if it is in the foreground, the OS assumes that the user wants to keep doing whatever he/she was doing. (If you are trying to kill the process from DDMS, you should hit the home button first, and then kill it)</li>\n<li>It also assumes that each activity is independent of all the other activities.  This is often true, for example in the case that your app launches the Browser Activity, which is entirely separate and was not written by you.  The Browser Activity may or may not be created on the same Task, depending on its manifest attributes.</li>\n<li>It assumes that each of your activities is completely self-reliant and can be killed/restored in a moment's notice.  (I rather dislike this particular assumption, since my app has many activities which rely on a large amount of cached data, too large to be efficiently serialized during <code>onSaveInstanceState</code>, but whaddya gonna do?)  For most well-written Android apps this should be true, since you never know when your app is going to be killed off in the background.</li>\n<li>The final factor is not so much an assumption, but rather a limitation of the OS:  <em>killing the app explicitly is the same as the app crashing, and also the same as Android killing the app to reclaim memory.</em>  This culminates in our coup de grace: since Android can't tell if the app exited or crashed or was killed in the background, it assumes the user wants to return where they left off, and so the ActivityManager restarts the process.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When you think about it, this is appropriate for the platform.  First, this is exactly what happens when the process is killed in the background and the user comes back to it, so it needs to be restarted where it left off.  Second, this is what happens when the app crashes and presents the dreaded Force Close dialog.</p>\n\n<p>Say I want my users to be able to take a picture and upload it. I launch the Camera Activity from my activity, and ask it to return an image.  The Camera is pushed onto the top of my current Task (rather than being created in its own Task).  If the Camera has an error and it crashes, should that result in the whole app crashing?  From the standpoint of the user, only the Camera failed, and they should be returned to their previous activity.  So it just restarts the process with all the same Activities in the stack, minus the Camera.  Since your Activities <em>should</em> be designed so that they can be killed and restored at the drop of a hat, this shouldn't be a problem.  Unfortunately, not all apps can be designed that way, so it <em>is</em> a problem for many of us, no matter what Romain Guy or anyone else tells you.  So, we need to use workarounds.</p>\n\n<p>So, my closing advice:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don't try to kill the process.  Either call <code>finish()</code> on all activities or call <code>moveTaskToBack(true)</code>.</li>\n<li>If your process crashes or gets killed, and if, like me, you need the data that was in memory which is now lost, you'll need to return to the root activity.  To do this, you should call <code>startActivity()</code> with an Intent that contains the <code>Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP</code> flag.</li>\n<li>If you want to kill your app from the Eclipse DDMS perspective, it had better not be in the foreground, or it will restart itself.  You should press the Home button first, and <em>then</em> kill the process.</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?", "answer_id": 2632649, "question_id": 2033914, "tags": ["android"]}, {"body": "<p>All of my applications have quit buttons... and I quite frequently get positive comments from users because of it.

Because your IT department commands it, users must be very conscious of when they are IN or OUT of the intranet. Hence your mindset of it being important for users to \"quit\".</p>\n\n<p>This is simple. Make a service that puts an ongoing notification in the notification bar saying \"I'm in the intranet, or I am running\". Have that service perform all the functionality that you need for your application.

This is a rather different style than the pure \"exit\" style application.</p>\n\n<p>On PCs, you have a multi-GUI desktop, on Android, you obviously have multi-tasks, but you only display one app at a time (I don't consider widgets here ^^). And on a mobile phone, at anytime, you could have a notification for something more important than what you are doing.</p>\n\n<p>So the whole concept of application rely on something different that \"enter application - work - exit application\".</p>\n\n<p>IMHO</p>\n", "title": "Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?", "answer_id": 9589611, "question_id": 2033914, "tags": ["android"]}, {"body": "<p>You apparently have found the answer you want in the finish() command.  This will not remove your app from memory, but Android will do so whenever it needs the resources, so it doesn't make any difference that you won't be doing that explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>I would only add that in order to attain the full effect that an application exit would typically have, you would want to reset the app's state to whatever its state is normally at the time it is first run after a boot of the device, just prior to calling finish() on all of your activities.  That way, if the user selects your app again, it will appear to have been run \"fresh,\" without any state left over from the point prior to the simulated \"exit.\"</p>\n\n<p>If there are some special actions that should only occur on \"exit,\" such as saving the user's work or whatever, you can also perform them prior to the re-initialization part of the above routine.</p>\n\n<p>This approach allows you to accomplish your goal of having an \"exit\" command without violating Android's philosophy of leaving the management of OS resources, including the closing of apps, in the hands of the operating system.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I would not use this approach, because Android users expect an app to preserve its continuity when they revisit it, and so they are not used to the modality of \"exiting\" an app.  I would instead support a \"clear\" function that a user can invoke to reset the app to some default initial state, without the necessity of \"leaving\" it in the process.</p>\n\n<p>The one exception would be when the user has hit the back button a sufficient number of times to cause the app to close.  In that situation, there is no expectation on the user's part that state will have been saved (and if there is unsaved state in the app, then you, as the developer, should have code handling the back button that detects that unsaved data, and prompts the user to save it to SharedPreferences or to a file, or to some other non-volatile medium).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Regarding system.exit(0):</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you do decide to use system.exit(0) to close your app with rude finality (e.g., as a result of a final back button press), then I would warn you that although for me this \"works,\" and in some cases has been the only way I've been able to close an app without any trace of it remaining, there is one minor glitch that occurs in Jelly Bean when you use this approach.  </p>\n\n<p>Specifically, if you use the Recent Apps list to open your app, and then use the back button to close the app (with that close implemented via system.exit(0)), the Recent Apps list will become visible again, as it will never have been closed.  If you then tap on your app's entry in that list to run it a <em>second time</em> from the same, already-open, Recent Apps list, there will be no response.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that the cause of this is that the Recent Apps list is holding on to a reference to your app that has become non-functional due to your having closed the app using system.exit(0).  A more civilized closing of your app using finish() might have informed the OS in a manner that would have allowed it to refresh its Recent Apps list, but system.exit(0) apparently does not do this.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a huge problem in and of itself, as very few people will open an app from Recent Apps, then exit it, and then immediately open it again from the same open Recent Apps list.  And if they tap the home button and then <em>re-open</em> the Recent Apps list, your app's entry will be there, and it will be fully functional.  <em>But</em> I think that it shows that the use of system.exit(0) can interfere with proper communication between your app and the OS, and this suggests that there may be other, more serious, possibly subtle, consequences of using this approach.</p>\n", "title": "Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?", "answer_id": 9665846, "question_id": 2033914, "tags": ["android"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>First of all, never never never use System.exit(0).</strong> Is like make a person sleep punching him on the head!</p>\n\n<p>Second: I'm facing this problem.

This is also contrary to how core applications\n  work.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>1: Totally exiting an application may be generally unmandetory, but it is not useless. What if windows had no exit option? System would be doggy slow as memory was full and OS had to guess at which programs you were done with. I don't care what Romain Guy or even Larry Page and Sergey Brin say - these are unquestionable facts: Systems run slower when they have to kill tasks to get their memory before a new app can be launched.   You just can't tell me that it doesn't take time to kill an app! Even the light from distance stars take time.. There <strong>is</strong> some use in allowing the user to fully close apps.</p>\n\n<p>2: Contrary to how core applications work? What's that supposed to mean? When I'm done running an app for now, it is no longer doing any work..It's just waiting to be killed by the OS when its memory is needed.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, there is a distinct difference between minimizing and exiting, and neither pinch hits well for the other. Do we leave a screwdriver in every screw? or a key in every door? Do we leave all of our appliances on high until the breaker blows and we need to turn on another appliance? Do we leave the dish washer full of dishes, and only take out enough each time to make room for some new dirty ones? Do we leave all the cars running in the driveway until -- oh never mind.</p>\n\n<p>If the user wants to minimize an app, then the best thing is to minimize it. If a user wants to exit an app, then by all means it is best to exit.</p>\n\n<p>Is it frowned on? That's Android's view - they frown on it. And many many independent rookie android devs frown on it.</p>\n\n<p>But when it comes right down to it, there is good coding and bad coding. There is good program flow models and there are bad program flow models.</p>\n\n<p>Leaving programs in memory when the user knows they are done with them simply is not good program flow. It serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever, and it slows things down when launching new apps or when running apps allocate more memory.</p>\n\n<p>It is sort of like your car: There are times when you leave it running, like stopping at a stop light, or perhaps the fast food drive through, or stopping at the ATM. But there are other situations where you do want to shut it off - like when you get to work, or the grocery store or even home.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if you're playing a game and the phone rings, yes. Pause the game and keep it running. But if the user is done with the game for a while, then by all means let them exit.</p>\n\n<p>The exit button on some applications should be more out in front than others. Games, for example, or programs where the user is likely to want to fully exit, should have an obvious exit. Other programs, like, perhaps, email programs, where exiting is an unlikely desire (so that it can keep checking for email) -- these programs should not waste prime control input screen space with an exit option, but for good program flow, it should have an exit option. What if someone decides they don't want their mail program trying to check email when they are in poor coverage area, or maybe in a skype call or whatever? Let them exit the email program if they want!</p>\n\n<p>Suspending and Exiting are two vital tasks and neither fulfills the role of the other.</p>\n\n<p>Jesse Gordon</p>\n", "title": "Quitting an application - is that frowned upon?", "answer_id": 18691453, "question_id": 2033914, "tags": ["android"]}, {"body": "<p>Currently i implemented the following in my app.May these helps to move out from application from where ever you want.

You could use this to create a gradient image for ie9, though personally, I wouldn't. However to be noted when using only images, ie &lt; 9 will ignore the fallback statement and not show any image. This does not happen when a gradient is included. To use a single fallback image in this case I suggest using Paul Irish's wonderful <a href=\"http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/\">Conditional HTML element</a> along with your fallback code:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>.lte9 #target{ background-image: url(\"IMAGE_URL\"); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Background position, sizing etc.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Other properties that would apply to a single image may also be comma separated. If only 1 value is supplied, that will be applied to all stacked images including the gradient. <code>background-size: 40px;</code> will constrain both the image and the gradient to 40px height and width. However using <code>background-size: 40px, cover;</code> will make the image 40px and the gradient will cover the element.</p>\n\n<p>The same applies to background-position, background-repeat, etc. </p>\n", "title": "How do I combine a background-image and CSS3 gradient on the same element?", "answer_id": 2547064, "question_id": 2504071, "tags": ["css", "css3", "background-image", "gradient"]}, {"body": "<p>One thing to realize is that the first defined background image is topmost in the stack.

In code, one needs to get the <code>LinearLayout.LayoutParams</code> of the view and set its gravity. Here is a code example that set a button to bottom in a horizontally oriented container:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import android.widget.LinearLayout.LayoutParams;\nimport android.view.Gravity;\n...\n\nButton button = (Button) findViewById(R.id.MyButtonId);\n// need to cast to LinearLayout.LayoutParams to access the gravity field\nLayoutParams params = (LayoutParams)button.getLayoutParams(); \nparams.gravity = Gravity.BOTTOM;\nbutton.setLayoutParams(params);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For horizontal <code>LinearLayout</code> container, the horizontal gravity of its child view is left-aligned one after another and cannot be changed. Setting <code>android:layout_gravity</code> to <code>center_horizontal</code> has no effect.  The default vertical gravity is center (or center_vertical) and can be changed to top or bottom. Actually the default <code>layout_gravity</code> value is <code>-1</code> but Android put it center vertically. </p>\n\n<p>To change the horizontal positions of child views in a horizontal linear container, one can use <code>layout_weight</code>, margin and padding of the child view. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, for vertical View Group container, the vertical gravity of its child view is top-aligned one below another and cannot be changed. The default horizontal gravity is center (or <code>center_horizontal</code>) and can be changed to left or right.</p>\n\n<p>Actually, a child view such as a button also has <code>android:gravity</code> XML attribute and the <code>setGravity()</code> method to control its child views -- the text in it. The <code>Button.setGravity(int)</code> is linked to this <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#setGravity%28int%29\">developer.android.com entry</a>.</p>\n", "title": "Gravity and layout_gravity on Android", "answer_id": 6885677, "question_id": 3482742, "tags": ["android", "android-layout"]}, {"body": "<p>If a we want to set the gravity of content inside a view then we will use \"android:gravity\", and if we want to set the gravity of this view (as a whole) within its parent view then we will use \"android:layout_gravity\". </p>\n", "title": "Gravity and layout_gravity on Android", "answer_id": 15912775, "question_id": 3482742, "tags": ["android", "android-layout"]}, {"body": "<p>Something I saw on Sandip's blog that I almost missed, fixed my problem.

Use them for Views in <code>LinearLayouts</code> and <code>FrameLayouts</code>. </p>\n\n<p>If I hadn't made the width and height of the <code>TextViews</code> larger than the text, then setting the <code>gravity</code> would have had no effect. So if you're using <code>wrap_content</code> on the <code>TextView</code> then gravity won't do anything. In the same way, if the <code>LinearLayout</code> had been set to <code>wrap_content</code>, then the <code>layout_gravity</code> would have had no effect on the <code>TextViews</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>layout_gravity=center</code> looks the same as <code>layout_gravity=center_horizontal</code> here because they are in a vertical linear layout. You can't center vertically in this case, so <code>layout_gravity=center</code> only centers horizontally.</p>\n\n<p>So remember, <strong>layout</strong>_gravity arranges a view in its <strong>layout</strong>. Gravity arranges the content inside the view. Its easy to forget which is which. Think of this little analogy to help you remember: In daily life, \"gravity\" is a more common term than \"layout gravity\". And in daily life, the earth's gravity is a more common experience than any other kind of gravity. So think of the earth like a TextView and you are the text. Now, just like it is hard to remember what \"layout gravity\" is, the gravity we don't think about much in daily life is the gravity of the sun pulling on the earth. So the sun is the earth's (TextView's) parent ViewGroup (a LinearLayout or whatever) and the earth's layout gravity is its orbit in the solar system.</p>\n\n<h1>xml</h1>\n\n<p>Here is the xml for the above image for your reference:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?&gt;\n&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:orientation=\"vertical\" &gt;\n\n    &lt;LinearLayout\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"0dp\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n        android:background=\"#e3e2ad\"\n        android:orientation=\"vertical\" &gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n            android:layout_gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\n            android:textSize=\"24sp\"\n            android:text=\"gravity=\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:background=\"#bcf5b1\"\n            android:gravity=\"left\"\n            android:text=\"left\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:background=\"#aacaff\"\n            android:gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\n            android:text=\"center_horizontal\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:background=\"#bcf5b1\"\n            android:gravity=\"right\"\n            android:text=\"right\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:background=\"#aacaff\"\n            android:gravity=\"center\"\n            android:text=\"center\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;\n\n    &lt;LinearLayout\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"0dp\"\n        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n        android:background=\"#d6c6cd\"\n        android:orientation=\"vertical\" &gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n            android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n            android:layout_gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\n            android:textSize=\"24sp\"\n            android:text=\"layout_gravity=\" /&gt;\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:layout_gravity=\"left\"\n            android:background=\"#bcf5b1\"\n            android:text=\"left\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:layout_gravity=\"center_horizontal\"\n            android:background=\"#aacaff\"\n            android:text=\"center_horizontal\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:layout_gravity=\"right\"\n            android:background=\"#bcf5b1\"\n            android:text=\"right\" /&gt;\n\n        &lt;TextView\n            android:layout_width=\"200dp\"\n            android:layout_height=\"40dp\"\n            android:layout_gravity=\"center\"\n            android:background=\"#aacaff\"\n            android:text=\"center\" /&gt;\n\n    &lt;/LinearLayout&gt;\n\n&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Related</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/25520320/3681880\">Difference between a View's Padding and Margin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/31145234/3681880\">Match_parent vs wrap_content</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27086486/how-to-set-both-gravity-and-layout-gravity-of-a-linearlayout-programatically/27086487#27086487\">How to set both gravity and layout gravity of a LinearLayout programatically</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Gravity and layout_gravity on Android", "answer_id": 26190050, "question_id": 3482742, "tags": ["android", "android-layout"]}, {"body": "<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/TzaKU.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Look at the image to be clear about gravity</p>\n", "title": "Gravity and layout_gravity on Android", "answer_id": 28315601, "question_id": 3482742, "tags": ["android", "android-layout"]}, {"body": "<p>Just thought I'd add my own explanation here - coming from a background on iOS, this is how I've internalized the two in iOS terms: \"Layout Gravity\" affects your position in the superview. \"Gravity\" affects the position of your subviews within you.

They can help you to extract exact information from a bigger match (which can also be named), they let you rematch a previous matched group, and can be used for substitutions. Let's try some examples, shall we?</p>\n\n<p>Ok, imagine you have some kind of XML or HTML (be aware that <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags\">regex may not be the best tool for the job</a>, but it is nice as an example). You want to parse the tags, so you could do something like this (I have added spaces to make it easier to understand):</p>\n\n<pre><code>   \\&lt;(?&lt;TAG&gt;.+?)\\&gt; [^&lt;]*? \\&lt;/\\k&lt;TAG&gt;\\&gt;\nor\n   \\&lt;(.+?)\\&gt; [^&lt;]*? \\&lt;/\\1\\&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first regex has a named group (TAG), while the second one uses a common group. Both regexes do the same thing: they use the value from the first group (the name of the tag) to match the closing that. The difference is that the first one uses the name to use the value, and the second one uses the group index (which starts at 1).</p>\n\n<p>Let's try some substitutions now. Consider the following text:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetuer feugiat fames malesuada pretium egestas.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, let's use the this dumb regex over it:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-regex prettyprint-override\"><code>\\b(\\S)(\\S)(\\S)(\\S*)\\b\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This regex matches words with at least 3 characters, and uses groups to separate the first three letters. The result is this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Match \"Lorem\"\n     Group 1: \"L\"\n     Group 2: \"o\"\n     Group 3: \"r\"\n     Group 4: \"em\"\nMatch \"ipsum\"\n     Group 1: \"i\"\n     Group 2: \"p\"\n     Group 3: \"s\"\n     Group 4: \"um\"\n...\n\nMatch \"consectetuer\"\n     Group 1: \"c\"\n     Group 2: \"o\"\n     Group 3: \"n\"\n     Group 4: \"sectetuer\"\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, if we apply the substitution string...</p>\n\n<pre><code>$1_$3$2_$4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... over it, we are trying to use the first group, add an underscore, use the third group, then the second group, add another underscore, and then the fourth group.

In C++03, rvalues of class type have a known dynamic type - it's the static type of that expression. Because to have it another way, you need references or dereferences, which evaluate to an lvalue.

Some rules make a distinction between lvalue and rvalue. For example, when it comes to overload resolution. Other rules make a distinction between glvalue and prvalue. For example, you can have a glvalue with an incomplete or abstract type but there is no prvalue with an incomplete or abstract type. Before we had this terminology the rules that actually need to distinguish between glvalue/prvalue referred to lvalue/rvalue and they were either unintentionally wrong or contained lots of explaining and exceptions to the rule a la \"...unless the rvalue is due to unnamed rvalue reference...\".

We just divided the rvalues into two subgroups, xvalues and prvalues, and we refer to lvalues and xvalues as glvalues. Xvalues are a new kind of value category for unnamed rvalue references. Every expression is one of these three: lvalue, xvalue, prvalue.

Are the WG21 gods just trying to confuse us mere mortals?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't feel that the other answers (good though many of them are) really capture the answer to this particular question. Yes, these categories and such exist to allow move semantics, but the complexity exists for one reason. This is the one inviolate rule of moving stuff in C++11:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thou shalt move only when it is unquestionably safe to do so.</strong></p>\n\n<p>That is why these categories exist: to be able to talk about values where it is safe to move from them, and to talk about values where it is not.</p>\n\n<p>In the earliest version of r-value references, movement happened easily. <em>Too</em> easily. Easily enough that there was a lot of potential for implicitly moving things when the user didn't really mean to.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the circumstances under which it is safe to move something:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>When it's a temporary or subobject thereof. (prvalue)</li>\n<li>When the user has <em>explicitly said to move it</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>SomeType &amp;&amp;Func() { ... }\n\nSomeType &amp;&amp;val = Func();\nSomeType otherVal{val};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What does this do? In older versions of the spec, before the 5 values came in, this would provoke a move. Of course it does. You passed an rvalue reference to the constructor, and thus it binds to the constructor that takes an rvalue reference. That's obvious.</p>\n\n<p>There's just one problem with this; you didn't <em>ask</em> to move it. Oh, you might say that the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> should have been a clue, but that doesn't change the fact that it broke the rule. <code>val</code> isn't a temporary because temporaries don't have names. You may have extended the lifetime of the temporary, but that means it isn't <em>temporary</em>; it's just like any other stack variable.</p>\n\n<p>If it's not a temporary, and you didn't ask to move it, then moving is <em>wrong.</em></p>\n\n<p>The obvious solution is to make <code>val</code> an lvalue. This means that you can't move from it. OK, fine; it's named, so its an lvalue.</p>\n\n<p>Once you do that, you can no longer say that <code>SomeType&amp;&amp;</code> means the same thing everwhere. You've now made a distinction between named rvalue references and unnamed rvalue references. Well, named rvalue references are lvalues; that was our solution above. So what do we call unnamed rvalue references (the return value from <code>Func</code> above)?</p>\n\n<p>It's not an lvalue, because you can't move from an lvalue. And we <em>need</em> to be able to move by returning a <code>&amp;&amp;</code>; how else could you explicitly say to move something? That is what <code>std::move</code> returns, after all. It's not an rvalue (old-style), because it can be on the left side of an equation (things are actually a bit more complicated, see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15482508/what-is-an-example-of-a-difference-in-allowed-usage-or-behavior-between-an-xvalu\">this question</a> and the comments below). It is neither an lvalue nor an rvalue; it's a new kind of thing.</p>\n\n<p>What we have is <strong>a value that you can treat as an lvalue, <em>except</em> that it is implicitly moveable from</strong>. We call it an <em><strong>xvalue</strong></em>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that xvalues are what makes us gain the other two categories of values: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A <strong>prvalue</strong> is really just the new name for the previous type of rvalue, i.e. they're <strong>the rvalues that <em>aren't</em> xvalues</strong>. </p></li>\n<li><p>The <strong>glvalues is the union of xvalues and lvalues in one group</strong>, because they do share a lot of properties in common.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So really, it all comes down to xvalues and the need to restrict movement to exactly and only certain places. Those places are defined by the rvalue category; prvalues are the implicit moves, and xvalues are the explicit moves (<code>std::move</code> returns an xvalue).</p>\n", "title": "What are rvalues, lvalues, xvalues, glvalues, and prvalues?", "answer_id": 9552880, "question_id": 3601602, "tags": ["c++", "expression", "c++-faq", "c++11"]}, {"body": "<h2><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>\n\n<p>ISOC++11 (officially ISO/IEC 14882:2011) is the most recent version of the standard of the C++ programming language.

A\n  list was made and in most cases  and in the most tricky/brittle text\n  \u201clvalue\u201d currently means \u201ciM\u201d. This is the classical meaning of lvalue\n  because \u201cin the old days\u201d nothing was moved; \u201cmove\u201d is a novel notion\n  in C++0x. Also, naming the topleft point of the W \u201clvalue\u201d gives us\n  the property that every value is an lvalue or an rvalue, but not both.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, the top left point of the W is \u201clvalue\u201d and the bottom right point\n  is \u201crvalue.\u201d What does that make the bottom left and top right points?\n  The bottom left point is a generalization of the classical lvalue,\n  allowing for move. So it is a \u201cgeneralized lvalue.\u201d We named it\n  \u201cglvalue.\u201d You can quibble about the abbreviation, but (I think) not\n  with the logic. We assumed that in serious use \u201cgeneralized lvalue\u201d\n  would somehow be abbreviated anyway, so we had better do it\n  immediately (or risk confusion). The top right point of the W is less\n  general than the bottom right (now, as ever, called \u201crvalue\u201d). That\n  point represent the original pure notion of an object you can move\n  from because it cannot be referred to again (except by a destructor).\n  I liked the phrase \u201cspecialized rvalue\u201d in contrast to \u201cgeneralized\n  lvalue\u201d but \u201cpure rvalue\u201d abbreviated to \u201cprvalue\u201d won out (and\n  probably rightly so). So, the left leg of the W is \u201clvalue\u201d and\n  \u201cglvalue\u201d and the right leg is \u201cprvalue\u201d and \u201crvalue.\u201d Incidentally,\n  every value is either a glvalue or a prvalue, but not both.</p>\n  \n  <p>This leaves the top middle of the W: \u201cim\u201d; that is, values that have\n  identity and can be moved. We really don\u2019t have anything that guides\n  us to a good name for those esoteric beasts. They are important to\n  people working with the (draft) standard text, but are unlikely to\n  become a household name. We didn\u2019t find any  real constraints on the\n  naming to guide us, so we picked \u2018x\u2019 for the center, the unknown, the\n  strange, the xpert only, or even x-rated.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zxsYZ.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zxsYZ.png\" alt=\"Steve showing off the final product\"></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "What are rvalues, lvalues, xvalues, glvalues, and prvalues?", "answer_id": 38169963, "question_id": 3601602, "tags": ["c++", "expression", "c++-faq", "c++11"]}, {"body": "<p>One addendum to the excellent answers above, on a point that confused me even after I had read Stroustrup and thought I understood the rvalue/lvalue distinction.

You have some completely fair, random dice. Would the die rolls be \"more random\" if before each die roll, you first put two dice in a bowl, shook it around, picked one of the dice at random, and then rolled that one? Clearly it would make no difference. If both dice give random numbers, then randomly choosing one of the two dice will make no difference. Either way you'll get a random number between 1 and 6 with even distribution over a sufficient number of rolls.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose in real life such a procedure might be useful if you suspected that the dice might NOT be fair. If, say, the dice are slightly unbalanced so one tends to give 1 more often than 1/6 of the time, and another tends to give 6 unusually often, then randomly choosing between the two would tend to obscure the bias. (Though in this case, 1 and 6 would still come up more than 2, 3, 4, and 5. Well, I guess depending on the nature of the imbalance.)</p>\n\n<p>There are many definitions of randomness. One definition of a random series is that it is a series of numbers produced by a random process. By this definition, if I roll a fair die 5 times and get the numbers 2, 4, 3, 2, 5, that is a random series. If I then roll that same fair die 5 more times and get 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, then that is also a random series.</p>\n\n<p>Several posters have pointed out that random functions on a computer are not truly random but rather pseudo-random, and that if you know the algorithm and the seed they are completely predictable. This is true, but most of the time completely irrelevant. If I shuffle a deck of cards and then turn them over one at a time, this should be a random series. If someone peeks at the cards, the result will be completely predictable, but by most definitions of randomness this will not make it less random. If the series passes statistical tests of randomness, the fact that I peeked at the cards will not change that fact. In practice, if we are gambling large sums of money on your ability to guess the next card, then the fact that you peeked at the cards is highly relevant. If we are using the series to simulate the menu picks of visitors to our web site in order to test the performance of the system, then the fact that you peeked will make no difference at all. (As long as you do not modify the program to take advantage of this knowledge.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p>I don't think I could my response to the Monty Hall problem into a comment, so I'll update my answer.</p>\n\n<p>For those who didn't read Belisarius link, the gist of it is: A game show contestant is given a choice of 3 doors. Behind one is a valuable prize, behind the others something worthless. He picks door #1. Before revealing whether it is a winner or a loser, the host opens door #3 to reveal that it is a loser. He then gives the contestant the opportunity to switch to door #2. Should the contestant do this or not?</p>\n\n<p>The answer, which offends many people's intuition, is that he should switch. The probability that his original pick was the winner is 1/3, that the other door is the winner is 2/3. My initial intuition, along with that of many other people, is that there would be no gain in switching, that the odds have just been changed to 50:50.</p>\n\n<p>After all, suppose that someone switched on the TV just after the host opened the losing door. That person would see two remaining closed doors. Assuming he knows the nature of the game, he would say that there is a 1/2 chance of each door hiding the prize. How can the odds for the viewer be 1/2 : 1/2 while the odds for the contestant are 1/3 : 2/3 ?</p>\n\n<p>I really had to think about this to beat my intuition into shape. To get a handle on it, understand that when we talk about probabilities in a problem like this, we mean, the probability you assign given the available information. To a member of the crew who put the prize behind, say, door #1, the probability that the prize is behind door #1 is 100% and the probability that it is behind either of the other two doors is zero.</p>\n\n<p>The crew member's odds are different than the contestant's odds because he knows something the contestant doesn't, namely, which door he put the prize behind. Likewise, the contestent's odds are different than the viewer's odds because he knows something that the viewer doesn't, namely, which door he initially picked. This is not irrelevant, because the host's choice of which door to open is not random. He will not open the door the contestant picked, and he will not open the door that hides the prize. If these are the same door, that leaves him two choices. If they are different doors, that leaves only one.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we come up with 1/3 and 2/3 ? When the contestant originally picked a door, he had a 1/3 chance of picking the winner. I think that much is obvious. That means there was a 2/3 chance that one of the other doors is the winner. If the host game him the opportunity to switch without giving any additional information, there would be no gain. Again, this should be obvious. But one way to look at it is to say that there is a 2/3 chance that he would win by switching. But he has 2 alternatives. So each one has only 2/3 divided by 2 = 1/3 chance of being the winner, which is no better than his original pick. Of course we already knew the final result, this just calculates it a different way.</p>\n\n<p>But now the host reveals that one of those two choices is not the winner. So of the 2/3 chance that a door he didn't pick is the winner, he now knows that 1 of the 2 alternatives isn't it. The other might or might not be. So he no longer has 2/3 dividied by 2. He has zero for the open door and 2/3 for the closed door. </p>\n", "title": "Understanding &quot;randomness&quot;", "answer_id": 3963531, "question_id": 3956478, "tags": ["math", "language-agnostic", "random"]}, {"body": "<p>Consider you have a simple coin flip problem where even is considered heads and odd is considered tails.

If you need a particular distribution, then ignore the whole \u201cwhich is more random\u201d question. So why is <code>rand()</code> more random?</p>\n\n<p>The core of why <code>rand()</code> is more random (under the assumption that it is producing floating-point random numbers with the range [0..1], which is very common) is that when you multiply two FP numbers together with lots of information in the mantissa, you get some loss of information off the end; there's just not enough bit in an IEEE double-precision float to hold all the information that was in two IEEE double-precision floats uniformly randomly selected from [0..1], and those extra bits of information are lost. Of course, it doesn't matter that much since you (probably) weren't going to use that information, but the loss is real. It also doesn't really matter which distribution you produce (i.e., which operation you use to do the combination). Each of those random numbers has (at best) 52 bits of random information \u2013 that's how much an IEEE double can hold \u2013 and if you combine two or more into one, you're still limited to having at most 52 bits of random information.</p>\n\n<p>Most uses of random numbers don't use even close to as much randomness as is actually available in the random source.

Suppose <code>RAND_MAX</code> happens to be defined as <code>2^n - 1</code> where <code>n</code> is some integer (this happens to be the case in Microsoft's implementation, where <code>n</code> is 15). Then we would say that a good implementation would return <code>n</code> bits of information.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine that <code>rand()</code> constructs random numbers by flipping a coin to find the value of one bit, and then repeating until it has a batch of 15 bits. Then the bits are independent (the value of any one bit does not influence the likelihood of other bits in the same batch have a certain value). So each bit considered independently is like a random number between 0 and 1 inclusive, and is \"evenly distributed\" over that range (as likely to be 0 as 1).</p>\n\n<p>The independence of the bits ensures that the numbers represented by batches of bits will also be evenly distributed over their range. This is intuitively obvious: if there are 15 bits, the allowed range is zero to <code>2^15 - 1</code> = 32767. Every number in that range is a unique pattern of bits, such as:</p>\n\n<pre><code>010110101110010\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and if the bits are independent then no pattern is more likely to occur than any other pattern. So all possible numbers in the range are equally likely. And so the reverse is true: if <code>rand()</code> produces evenly distributed integers, then those numbers are made of independent bits.</p>\n\n<p>So think of <code>rand()</code> as a production line for making bits, which just happens to serve them up in batches of arbitrary size. If you don't like the size, break the batches up into individual bits, and then put them back together in whatever quantities you like (though if you need a particular range that is not a power of 2, you need to shrink your numbers, and by far the easiest way to do that is to convert to floating point).</p>\n\n<p>Returning to your original suggestion, suppose you want to go from batches of 15 to batches of 30, ask <code>rand()</code> for the first number, bit-shift it by 15 places, then add another <code>rand()</code> to it. That is a way to combine two calls to <code>rand()</code> without disturbing an even distribution. It works simply because there is no overlap between the locations where you place the bits of information.</p>\n\n<p>This is very different to \"stretching\" the range of <code>rand()</code> by multiplying by a constant. For example, if you wanted to double the range of <code>rand()</code> you could multiply by two - but now you'd only ever get even numbers, and never odd numbers! That's not exactly a smooth distribution and might be a serious problem depending on the application, e.g. a roulette-like game supposedly allowing odd/even bets. (By thinking in terms of bits, you'd avoid that mistake intuitively, because you'd realise that multiplying by two is the same as shifting the bits to the left (greater significance) by one place and filling in the gap with zero. So obviously the amount of information is the same - it just moved a little.)</p>\n\n<p>Such gaps in number ranges can't be griped about in floating point number applications, because floating point ranges inherently have gaps in them that simply cannot be represented at all: an <em>infinite</em> number of missing real numbers exist in the gap between each two representable floating point numbers! So we just have to learn to live with gaps anyway.</p>\n\n<p>As others have warned, intuition is risky in this area, especially because mathematicians can't resist the allure of real numbers, which are horribly confusing things full of gnarly infinities and apparent paradoxes.</p>\n\n<p>But at least if you think it terms of bits, your intuition might get you a little further.

This works in Python 2 and 3.</p>\n\n<pre><code>raise ValueError('A very specific bad thing happened', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz') \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These arguments are accessed by the <code>args</code> attribute on the Exception object. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try:\n    some_code_that_may_raise_our_value_error()\nexcept ValueError as err:\n    print(err.args)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>prints </p>\n\n<pre><code>('message', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz')    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In Python 2.5, an actual <code>message</code> attribute was added to BaseException in favor of encouraging users to subclass Exceptions and stop using <code>args</code>, but <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0352/#retracted-ideas\">the introduction of <code>message</code> and the original deprecation of args has been retracted</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>When in <code>except</code> clause</h2>\n\n<p>When inside an except clause, you might want to, e.g. log that a specific type of error happened, and then reraise. The best way to do this while preserving the stack trace is to use a bare raise statement, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try:\n    do_something_in_app_that_breaks_easily()\nexcept AppError as error:\n    logger.error(error)\n    raise                 # just this!\n    # raise AppError      # Don't do this, you'll lose the stack trace!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can preserve the stacktrace (and error value) with <code>sys.exc_info()</code>, but this is way more error prone, prefer to use a bare <code>raise</code> to reraise. This is the syntax in Python 2:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    raise AppError, error, sys.exc_info()[2] # avoid this.\n    # Equivalently, as error *is* the second object:\n    raise sys.exc_info()[0], sys.exc_info()[1], sys.exc_info()[2]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement\">Python 3</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    raise error.with_traceback(sys.exc_info()[2])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again: avoid manually manipulating tracebacks. It's <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-raise-statement\">less efficient</a> and more error prone. And if you're using threading and <code>sys.exc_info</code> you may even get the wrong traceback (especially if you're using exception handling for control flow - which I'd personally tend to avoid.)</p>\n\n<h3>Python 3, Exception chaining</h3>\n\n<p>In Python 3, you can chain Exceptions, which preserve tracebacks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    raise RuntimeError('specific message') from error\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But beware, this <em>does</em> change the error type raised.</p>\n\n<h2>Deprecated Methods:</h2>\n\n<p>These can easily hide and even get into production code.

Its improvements over <code>setuptools</code> got merged back into <code>setuptools</code>. Trying to install <code>distribute</code> will just install <code>setuptools</code> instead.</li>\n<li><code>easy_install</code> itself is only quasi-maintained.</li>\n<li>All of the cases where <code>pip</code> used to be inferior to <code>easy_install</code>\u2014installing from an unpacked source tree, from a DVCS repo, etc.\u2014are long-gone; you can <code>pip install .</code>, <code>pip install git+https://</code>.</li>\n<li><code>pip</code> comes with the official Python 2.7 and 3.4+ packages from python.org, and a <code>pip</code> bootstrap is included by default if you build from source.</li>\n<li>The various incomplete bits of documentation on installing, using, and building packages have been replaced by the <a href=\"https://packaging.pypa.io/\">Python Packaging User Guide</a>. Python's own documentation on <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html\">Installing Python Modules</a> now defers to this user guide, and explicitly calls out <code>pip</code> as \"the preferred installer program\".</li>\n<li>Other new features have been added to <code>pip</code> over the years that will never be in <code>easy_install</code>. For example, <code>pip</code> makes it easy to clone your site-packages by building a requirements file and then installing it with a single command on each side. Or to convert your requirements file to a local repo to use for in-house development. And so on.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The only good reason that I know of to use <code>easy_install</code> in 2015 is the special case of using Apple's pre-installed Python versions with OS X 10.5-10.8. Since 10.5, Apple has included <code>easy_install</code>, but as of 10.10 they still don't include <code>pip</code>. With 10.9+, you should still just use <code>get-pip.py</code>, but for 10.5-10.8, this has some problems, so it's easier to <code>sudo easy_install pip</code>. (In general, <code>easy_install pip</code> is a bad idea; it's only for OS X 10.5-10.8 that you want to do this.) Also, 10.5-10.8 include <code>readline</code> in a way that <code>easy_install</code> knows how to kludge around but <code>pip</code> doesn't, so you also want to <code>sudo easy_install readline</code> if you want to upgrade that.</p>\n", "title": "Why use pip over easy_install?", "answer_id": 30408520, "question_id": 3220404, "tags": ["python", "pip", "setuptools", "easy-install", "pypi"]}, {"body": "<p>I found another case where <strong>pip</strong> installs an older version.

The explicit arguments get values first and then everything else is passed to <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>.  The named arguments come first in the list.  For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>def table_things(titlestring, **kwargs)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also use both in the same function definition but <code>*args</code> must occur before <code>**kwargs</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use the <code>*</code> and <code>**</code> syntax when calling a function.  For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def print_three_things(a, b, c):\n...     print 'a = {0}, b = {1}, c = {2}'.format(a,b,c)\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mylist = ['aardvark', 'baboon', 'cat']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print_three_things(*mylist)\na = aardvark, b = baboon, c = cat\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see in this case it takes the list (or tuple) of items and unpacks it. By this it matches them to the arguments in the function.  Of course, you could have a <code>*</code> both in the function definition and in the function call.</p>\n", "title": "*args and **kwargs?", "answer_id": 3394898, "question_id": 3394835, "tags": ["python", "args", "kwargs"]}, {"body": "<p>One place where the use of <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code> is quite useful is for subclassing.</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self, value1, value2):\n        # do something with the values\n        print value1, value2\n\nclass MyFoo(Foo):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # do something else, don't care about the args\n        print 'myfoo'\n        super(MyFoo, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This way you can extend the behaviour of the Foo class, without having to know too much about Foo.

For example, <code>:%s/foo/bar</code> means \"<strong>in the current file</strong>, replace occurrences of <code>foo</code> with <code>bar</code>.\" If you highlight some text before typing <code>:s</code>, you'll see that the highlighted lines take the place of <code>%</code> as your substitution range.</p>\n\n<h2><code>:w</code> isn't updating your file</h2>\n\n<p>One confusing part of this trick is that you might think <code>:w</code> is modifying your file, but it isn't. If you opened and modified <code>file1.txt</code>, then ran <code>:w file2.txt</code>, it would be a \"save as\"; <code>file1.txt</code> wouldn't be modified, but the current buffer contents would be sent to <code>file2.txt</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of <code>file2.txt</code>, you can <strong>substitute a shell command to receive the buffer contents</strong>. For instance, <code>:w !cat</code> will just display the contents.</p>\n\n<p>If Vim wasn't run with sudo access, its <code>:w</code> can't modify a protected file, but if it passes the buffer contents to the shell, <strong>a command in the shell <em>can</em> be run with sudo</strong>. In this case, we use <code>tee</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Understanding tee</h2>\n\n<p>As for <code>tee</code>, picture the <code>tee</code> command as a T-shaped pipe in a normal bash piping situation: it directs output to specified file(s) and <strong>also sends it to standard output</strong>, which can be captured by the next piped command. </p>\n\n<p>For example, in <code>ps -ax | tee processes.txt | grep 'foo'</code>, the list of processes will be written to a text file <strong>and</strong> passed along to <code>grep</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>     +-----------+    tee     +------------+\n     |           |  --------  |            |\n     | ps -ax    |  --------  | grep 'foo' |\n     |           |     ||     |            |\n     +-----------+     ||     +------------+\n                       ||   \n               +---------------+\n               |               |\n               | processes.txt |\n               |               |\n               +---------------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Diagram created with <a href=\"http://www.asciiflow.com/\">Asciiflow</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://ss64.com/bash/tee.html\"><code>tee</code> man page</a> for more info.</p>\n\n<h2>Tee as a hack</h2>\n\n<p>In the situation your question describes, <strong>using <code>tee</code> is a hack because we're ignoring half of what it does</strong>. <code>sudo tee</code> writes to our file and also sends the buffer contents to standard output, but <strong>we ignore standard output</strong>. We don't need to pass anything to another piped command in this case; we're just using <code>tee</code> as an alternate way of writing a file and so that we can call it with <code>sudo</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Making this trick easy</h2>\n\n<p>You can add this to your <code>.vimrc</code> to make this trick easy-to-use: just type <code>:w!!</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\" Allow saving of files as sudo when I forgot to start vim using sudo.\ncmap w!! w !sudo tee &gt; /dev/null %\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>&gt; /dev/null</code> part <strong>explicitly</strong> throws away the standard output, since, as I said, we don't need to pass anything to another piped command.</p>\n", "title": "How does the vim &quot;write with sudo&quot; trick work?", "answer_id": 7078429, "question_id": 2600783, "tags": ["vim", "sudo"]}, {"body": "<p>This also works well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>:w !sudo sh -c \"cat &gt; %\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is inspired by the comment of @Nathan Long. </p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTICE</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"</code> must be used instead of <code>'</code> because we want <code>%</code> to be expanded before passing to shell. </p>\n", "title": "How does the vim &quot;write with sudo&quot; trick work?", "answer_id": 25010815, "question_id": 2600783, "tags": ["vim", "sudo"]}], "question_id": 2600783}, {"body": "<p>Yesterday, I posted a question on how to clone a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29\">Git</a> repository from one of my machines to another, <em><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808177/how-can-i-git-clone-from-another-machine/2809612#2809612\">How can I 'git clone' from another machine?</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>I am now able to successfully clone a Git repository from my source (192.168.1.2) to my destination (192.168.1.1).</p>\n\n<p>But when I did an edit to a file, a <code>git commit -a -m \"test\"</code> and a <code>git push</code>, I get this error on my destination (192.168.1.1):</p>\n\n<pre><code>git push                                                \nhap@192.168.1.2's password: \nCounting objects: 21, done.\nCompressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (11/11), 1010 bytes, done.\nTotal 11 (delta 9), reused 0 (delta 0)\nerror: refusing to update checked out branch: refs/heads/master\nerror: By default, updating the current branch in a non-bare repository\nerror: is denied, because it will make the index and work tree inconsistent\nerror: with what you pushed, and will require 'git reset --hard' to match\nerror: the work tree to HEAD.\nerror: \nerror: You can set 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to\nerror: 'ignore' or 'warn' in the remote repository to allow pushing into\nerror: its current branch; however, this is not recommended unless you\nerror: arranged to update its work tree to match what you pushed in some\nerror: other way.\nerror: \nerror: To squelch this message and still keep the default behaviour, set\nerror: 'receive.denyCurrentBranch' configuration variable to 'refuse'.\nTo git+ssh://hap@192.168.1.2/media/LINUXDATA/working\n!

But <em>then</em>, the project starts getting more involved and you want to work on it from another computer (like your home PC or laptop), so you do something like</p>\n\n<pre><code>machine2:~&gt; git clone ssh://machine1/~/proj1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and it clones and everything looks good, and so you work on your code from machine2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Then</strong>... you try to push your commits from machine2, and you get the warning message in the title.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for this message is because the git repo you pulled from was kinda intended to be used just for that folder on machine1. You can <em>clone</em> from it just fine, but pushing can cause problems. The \"proper\" way to be managing the code in two different locations is with a \"bare\" repo, like has been suggested. A bare repo isn't designed to have any work being done <em>in</em> it, it is meant to coordinate the commits from multiple sources. This is why the top-rated answer suggests <em>deleting</em> all files/folders other than the .git folder after you <code>git config --bool core.bare true</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarifying the top-rated answer:</strong> Many of the comments to that answer say something like \"I didn't delete the non-.git files from the machine1 and I was still able to commit from machine2\". That's right. However, those other files are completely \"divorced\" from the git repo, now. Go try <code>git status</code> in there and you should see something like \"fatal: This operation must be run in a work tree\". So, the suggestion to delete the files isn't so that the commit from machine2 will <em>work</em>; it's so that you don't get confused and think that git is still tracking those files. But, deleting the files is a problem if you still want to work on the files on machine1, isn't it?</p>\n\n<p><strong>So, what should you really do?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Depends upon how much you plan to still work on machine1 and machine2...</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you're done developing from machine1 and have moved all of your development to machine2...</strong> just do what the top-rated answer suggests: <code>git config --bool core.bare true</code> and then, optionally, delete all files/folders other than .git from that folder, since they're untracked and likely to cause confusion.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If your work on machine2 was just a one-time thing, and you don't need to continue development there...</strong> then don't bother with making a bare repo; just ftp/rsync/scp/etc. your files from machine*2* on top of the files on machine*1*, commit/push from machine*1*, and then delete the files off of machine*2*. Others have suggested creating a branch, but I think that's a little messy if you just want to merge some development you did on a one-time basis from another machine.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you need to continue development on both machine1 and machine2...</strong> then you need to set things up properly. You need to convert your repo to a bare, <em>then</em> you need to make a clone of that on machine1 for you to <em>work</em> in. Probably the quickest way to do this is to do</p>\n\n<pre><code>machine1:~/proj1&gt; git config --bool core.bare true\nmachine1:~/proj1&gt; mv .git/ ../proj1.git\nmachine1:~/proj1&gt; cd ..\nmachine1:~&gt; rm -rf proj1\nmachine1:~&gt; git clone proj1.git\nmachine1:~&gt; cd proj1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Very important:</strong> because you've moved the location of the repo from proj1 to proj1.git, <em>you need to update this in the .git/config file on machine2</em>. After that, you can commit your changes from machine2. Lastly, I try to keep my bare repos in a central location, away from my work trees (i.e. don't put 'proj1.git' in the same parent folder as 'proj1'). I advise you to do likewise, but I wanted to keep the steps above as simple as possible.</p>\n", "title": "Git push error &#39;[remote rejected] master -&gt; master (branch is currently checked out)&#39;", "answer_id": 37197408, "question_id": 2816369, "tags": ["git", "git-push"]}], "question_id": 2816369}, {"body": "<p>I would like to create an HTML button that acts like a link.

Yes, you could use padding, but if you want your button to dynamically resize, that won't be as clean.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sometimes when you embed an &lt;a> within a div, only the text is clickable, this setup makes the whole button clickable.</p></li>\n<li><p>You don't have to deal with forms if you're just trying to move to another page.

This works really well but sometimes appends a <code>?</code> to the URL.

So in other words for the code above your url will end up looking like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://someserver/pages2?\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There is one way to fix this but it will require server side configuration. One example using <strong>Apache Mod_rewrite</strong> would be to redirect all requests with a trailing <code>?</code> to their corresponding URL without the <code>?</code>. Here is an example using .htaccess, but there is a full thread <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14165287/removing-trailing-question-mark-with-htaccess\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \\?\\ HTTP [NC] \nRewriteRule ^/?(index\\.cfm)? /? [R=301,L]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Similar configurations can vary depending on the webserver and stack used. So a summary of this approach:</p>\n\n<p>Pros:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is a real button, semantically it makes sense.</li>\n<li>Since it is a real button, it will also act like a real button (e.g. draggable behavior and/or mimic a click when pressing space bar when active).</li>\n<li>No JavaScript, no complex style required.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Trailing <code>?</code> looks ugly in some browsers. This can be fixed by a hack (in some cases) using POST instead of GET but the clean way is to have server side redirect. The downside with the server side redirect is that it will cause an extra HTTP call for these links because of the 304 redirect.</li>\n<li>Adds extra <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element</li>\n<li>Element positioning when using multiple forms can be tricky and becomes even worse when dealing with responsive designs. Some layout can become impossible to achieve with this solution depending on the order of the elements. This can end up impacting usability if the design is impacted by this challenge.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Solution 2: Using JavaScript.</h2>\n\n<p>You can use JavaScript to trigger onclick and other events to mimic the behavoir of a link using a button. The example below could be improve and remove from the HTML but is there simply to illustrate the idea:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=\"window.location.href='/page2'\"&gt;Continue&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Pros:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Simple (for basic requirement) and keep semantic while not requiring an extra form.</li>\n<li>Since it is a real button, it will also act like a real button (e.g. draggable behavior and/or mimic a click when pressing space bar when active).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Requires JavaScript which means less accessible. This is not ideal for a base (core) element such as a link.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Solution 3: Anchor (link) styled like a button.</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/710089/how-do-i-make-an-html-link-look-like-a-button\">Styling a link like a button</a> is relatively easy and can provide similar experience across different browsers. Bootstrap does this but it is also easy to achieve on your own using simple styles.</p>\n\n<p>Pros:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Simple (for basic requirement) and good cross browser support.</li>\n<li>Does not need a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> to work.</li>\n<li>Does not need JavaScript to work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Cons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Semantic is sort of broken, because you want a button that acts like a link and not a link that acts like a button.</li>\n<li>Will not reproduce all behaviors of solution #1. Will not support the same behavior as button. For example links react differently when dragged. Also the \"space bar\" link trigger will not work without some extra JavaScript. It will add a lot of complexity since browsers are not consistent on how they support <code>keypress</code> events on buttons.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Solution #1 (<strong>Button in a form</strong>) seems like the most transparent for users with minimal work required. If your layout is not impacted by this choice and the server side tweak is feasible, this is a good option for cases where accessibility is the top priority (e.g. links on an error page or error messages). </p>\n\n<p>If JavaScript is not an obstacle to your accessibility requirements, then solution #2 (<strong>JavaScript</strong>) would be preferred over #1 and #3.</p>\n\n<p>If for some reason, accessibility is vital (JavaScript is not an option) but you are in a situation where your design and/or your server configuration is preventing you from using option #1, then solution #3 (<strong>Anchor styled like a button</strong>) is a good alternative solve this problem with minimal usability impact.</p>\n", "title": "How to create an HTML button that acts like a link?", "answer_id": 37335668, "question_id": 2906582, "tags": ["html", "button", "hyperlink", "htmlbutton"]}], "question_id": 2906582}, {"body": "<p>I had an interesting job interview experience a while back. The question started really easy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Q1</strong>: We have a bag containing numbers <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, \u2026, <code>100</code>. Each number appears exactly once, so there are 100 numbers. Now one number is randomly picked out of the bag. Find the missing number.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I've heard this interview question before, of course, so I very quickly answered along the lines of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>A1</strong>: Well, the sum of the numbers <code>1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + N</code> is <code>(N+1)(N/2)</code> (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_sum#Sum\">Wikipedia: sum of arithmetic series</a>). For <code>N = 100</code>, the sum is <code>5050</code>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, if all numbers are present in the bag, the sum will be exactly <code>5050</code>. Since one number is missing, the sum will be less than this, and the difference is that number. So we can find that missing number in <code>O(N)</code> time and <code>O(1)</code> space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At this point I thought I had done well, but all of a sudden the question took an unexpected turn:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Q2</strong>: That is correct, but now how would you do this if <em>TWO</em> numbers are missing?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had never seen/heard/considered this variation before, so I panicked and couldn't answer the question. The interviewer insisted on knowing my thought process, so I mentioned that perhaps we can get more information by comparing against the expected product, or perhaps doing a second pass after having gathered some information from the first pass, etc, but I really was just shooting in the dark rather than actually having a clear path to the solution.</p>\n\n<p>The interviewer did try to encourage me by saying that having a second equation is indeed one way to solve the problem. At this point I was kind of upset (for not knowing the answer before hand), and asked if this is a general (read: \"useful\") programming technique, or if it's just a trick/gotcha answer.</p>\n\n<p>The interviewer's answer surprised me: you can generalize the technique to find 3 missing numbers. In fact, you can generalize it to find <em>k</em> missing numbers.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Qk</strong>: If exactly <em>k</em> numbers are missing from the bag, how would you find it efficiently?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This was a few months ago, and I still couldn't figure out what this technique is.  Obviously there's a <code>\u03a9(N)</code> time lower bound since we must scan all the numbers at least once, but the interviewer insisted that the <em>TIME</em> and <em>SPACE</em> complexity of the solving technique (minus the <code>O(N)</code> time input scan) is defined in <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So the question here is simple:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How would you solve <strong>Q2</strong>?</li>\n<li>How would you solve <strong>Q3</strong>?</li>\n<li>How would you solve <strong>Qk</strong>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Clarifications</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Generally there are <em>N</em> numbers from 1..<em>N</em>, not just 1..100.</li>\n<li>I'm not looking for the obvious set-based solution, e.g. using a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array\">bit set</a>, encoding the presence/absence each number by the value of a designated bit, therefore using <code>O(N)</code> bits in additional space. We can't afford any additional space proportional to <em>N</em>.</li>\n<li>I'm also not looking for the obvious sort-first approach. This and the set-based approach are worth mentioning in an interview (they are easy to implement, and depending on <em>N</em>, can be very practical). I'm looking for the Holy Grail solution (which may or may not be practical to implement, but has the desired asymptotic characteristics nevertheless).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So again, of course you must scan the input in <code>O(N)</code>, but you can only capture small amount of information (defined in terms of <em>k</em> not <em>N</em>), and must then find the <em>k</em> missing numbers somehow.</p>\n", "title": "Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s)", "tags": ["algorithm", "math"], "answer_count": 40, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3492302/easy-interview-question-got-harder-given-numbers-1-100-find-the-missing-numbe", "answers": [{"body": "<p>We can solve Q2 by summing both the numbers themselves, and the <em>squares</em> of the numbers.</p>\n\n<p>We can then reduce the problem to</p>\n\n<pre><code>k1 + k2 = x\nk1^2 + k2^2 = y\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are how far the sums are below the expected values.</p>\n\n<p>Substituting gives us:</p>\n\n<pre><code>(x-k2)^2 + k2^2 = y\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which we can then solve to determine our missing numbers.</p>\n", "title": "Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s)", "answer_id": 3492373, "question_id": 3492302, "tags": ["algorithm", "math"]}, {"body": "<p>Can you check if every number exists?

As the question is stated, there are 100 numbers in the bag.

However, if you change the way the set is implemented you can print out the numbers in k iterations.

That time can be put to use inserting some identifying facet of each sent message into a set and deleting it as each corresponding reply arrives.  Once the last reply has arrived, the only thing to be done is to remove its identifier from the set, which in typical implementations takes <code>O(log k+1)</code>.

No matter the order of the set of numbers, the answer should be the same. If you're going to use <code>k</code> functions to help determine the missing elements, you should be thinking about what functions have that property: symmetric. The function <code>s_1(x) = x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n</code> is an example of a symmetric function, but there are others of higher degree. In particular, consider the <strong>elementary symmetric functions</strong>. The elementary symmetric function of degree 2 is <code>s_2(x) = x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + ... + x_1 x_n + x_2 x_3 + ... + x_(n-1) x_n</code>, the sum of all products of two elements. Similarly for the elementary symmetric functions of degree 3 and higher. They are obviously symmetric. Furthermore, it turns out they are the building blocks for all symmetric functions.</p>\n\n<p>You can build the elementary symmetric functions as you go by noting that <code>s_2(x,x_(n+1)) = s_2(x) + s_1(x)(x_(n+1))</code>. Further thought should convince you that <code>s_3(x,x_(n+1)) = s_3(x) + s_2(x)(x_(n+1))</code> and so on, so they can be computed in one pass.</p>\n\n<p>How do we tell which items were missing from the array? Think about the polynomial <code>(z-x_1)(z-x_2)...(z-x_n)</code>. It evaluates to <code>0</code> if you put in any of the numbers <code>x_i</code>. Expanding the polynomial, you get <code>z^n-s_1(x)z^(n-1)+ ... + (-1)^n s_n</code>. The elementary symmetric functions appear here too, which is really no surprise, since the polynomial should stay the same if we apply any permutation to the roots.</p>\n\n<p>So we can build the polynomial and try to factor it to figure out which numbers are not in the set, as others have mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if we are concerned about overflowing memory with large numbers (the nth symmetric polynomial will be of the order <code>100!</code>), we can do these calculations <code>mod p</code> where <code>p</code> is a prime bigger than 100. In that case we evaluate the polynomial <code>mod p</code> and find that it again evaluates to <code>0</code> when the input is a number in the set, and it evaluates to a non-zero value when the input is a number not in the set. However, as others have pointed out, to get the values out of the polynomial in time that depends on <code>k</code>, not <code>N</code>, we have to factor the polynomial <code>mod p</code>.</p>\n", "title": "Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s)", "answer_id": 29763246, "question_id": 3492302, "tags": ["algorithm", "math"]}, {"body": "<pre><code>    //sort\n    int missingNum[2];//missing 2 numbers- can be applied to more than 2\n    int j = 0;    \n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; length - 1; i++){\n        if(arr[i+1] - arr[i] &gt; 1 ) {\n            missingNum[j] = arr[i] + 1;\n            j++;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Easy interview question got harder: given numbers 1..100, find the missing number(s)", "answer_id": 33072084, "question_id": 3492302, "tags": ["algorithm", "math"]}, {"body": "<p>To solve the 2 (and 3) missing numbers question, you can modify <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>quickselect</code></a>, which on average runs in <code>O(n)</code> and uses constant memory if partitioning is done in-place.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Partition the set with respect to a random pivot <code>p</code> into partitions <code>l</code>, which  contain numbers smaller than the pivot, and <code>r</code>, which contain numbers greater than the pivot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Determine which partitions the 2 missing numbers are in by comparing the pivot value to the size of each partition (<code>p - 1 - count(l) = count of missing numbers in l</code> and \n<code>n - count(r) - p = count of missing numbers in r</code>)</p></li>\n<li><p>a) If each partition is missing one number, then use the difference of sums approach to find each missing number.</p>\n\n<p><code>(1 + 2 + ... + (p-1)) - sum(l) = missing #1</code> and \n  <code>((p+1) + (p+2) ... + n) - sum(r) = missing #2</code></p>\n\n<p>b) If one partition is missing both numbers and the partition is empty, then the missing numbers are either <code>(p-1,p-2)</code> or <code>(p+1,p+2)</code>\n  depending on which partition is missing the numbers.</p>\n\n<p>If one partition is missing 2 numbers but is not empty, then recurse onto that partiton.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>With only 2 missing numbers, this algorithm always discards at least one partition, so it retains <code>O(n)</code> average time complexity of quickselect.

Side effects produced by evaluations that occur after the sequence point will therefor be separated from side effects produced by evaluations that occur before the sequence point and happen afterwards.</p>\n\n<h3>Evaluations</h3>\n\n<p>Evaluating something means to apply some runtime semantics on an expression. There are unevaluated expressions (operands of <code>sizeof</code>, some operands of <code>typeid</code> and such) that only inspect the expression's type and don't have meaning at runtime. If an expression is evaluated, it can result in a value which may imply reading values out of objects, or it may just evaluate to an object without reading the value of it (it then remains an <em>lvalue</em>, as with the left subexpression of an assignment). In addition, it can produce side effects as necessary. An evaluation is complete if its value is known, but until a sequence point has been reached, side effects produced by the evaluation are assumed to be still processed. </p>\n\n<p>You have sequence points after all evaluations that usually are needed to be processed completely before some certain other expressions are processed. These are </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>After evaluation of <code>a</code> in <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> and <code>a || b</code> and <code>a ? b : c</code>. Also after evaluation of <code>a</code> in <code>a, b</code> - this operator is called the \"comma operator\". </li>\n<li>For a function call, after evaluating the function call arguments and before starting evaluations in the function body. </li>\n<li>After the evaluation of a complete expression (one that wasn't evaluated as part of another expression). Examples are loop conditions, if conditions, switch values and expression statements. </li>\n<li>Immediately before a function terminates (by unwinding the function by an exception or by ordinarily returning it after (possibly) creating the return value). This makes sure that every side effect in a function really has been settled and is completely processed. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Side effects</h3>\n\n<p>A side effect is a change in the execution environment of the program that happens in addition to simply computing a value. This can be (among others) writing to an object, calling an input/output function or calling a function that does so. </p>\n\n<h3>Flow of program execution</h3>\n\n<p>With these three terms, the flow of a program can be visualized as follows. In the following diagrams, an <code>E(X)</code> specifies the evaluation of a (sub-)expression <code>x</code>, an <code>%</code> specifies a sequence point and an <code>S(k, e)</code> specifies a side effect <code>k</code> on an object <code>e</code>. If an evaluation needs to read a value from a named object (if <code>x</code> is a name), the evaluation is written as <code>V(x)</code>, otherwise it's written as <code>E(x)</code>. Side effects are written right and left to the expressions. An edge between two expressions means that the upper expression is evaluated before the lower expression (usually because the lower expression depends on the value or lvalue of the upper expression). </p>\n\n<p>If you look at the two expression statements <code>i++; i++;</code>, you can depict the following diagram</p>\n\n<pre><code>E(i++) -&gt; { S(increment, i) }\n   |\n   %\n   |\nE(i++) -&gt; { S(increment, i) }\n   |\n   %\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As can be seen, there are two sequence points, and one of them separates the two modifications of <code>i</code>. Function call arguments are interesting too, although I will omit the diagram for this</p>\n\n<pre><code>int c = 0;\nint d = 0;\nvoid f(int a, int b) { assert((a == c - 1) &amp;&amp; (b == d - 1)); }\nint main() { f(c++, d++); }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The assert is fine, because it is guaranteed that when <code>f</code>'s body is executed, side effects produced by argument evaluations are complete: Therefor, <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> have been completely incremented.</p>\n\n<p>Let's consider the expression statement <code>i++ * j++;</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>{ S(increment, i) } &lt;- E(i++)      E(j++) -&gt; { S(increment, j) }\n                           \\       /\n                            +--+--+\n                               |\n                         E(i++ * j++)\n                               |\n                               %\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Wow, where do the two branches come from? Remember from the initial definition of sequence point: Sequence points affect evaluations that occur <strong>prior</strong> to it. All subexpressions of the multiplication are evaluated prior to it and there is no other sequence point, so we must assume \"maximal parallelity\" to find where potentially we have concurring writes to the same object. More formally, the two branches are not <em>ordered</em>. The sequence point relation is this a relation that orders some evaluations to each other and doesn't order others: It's therefor a <strong>partial order</strong>. </p>\n\n<h3>Conflicting side effects</h3>\n\n<p>To give the compiler maximal freedom in generating and optimizing machine code, cases like the multiplication above don't sequence the evaluations of subexpressions and don't separate the side effects produced by them except in the few cases outlined above. This can lead to conflicts, and the C++ Standard marks behavior of programs undefined if they try to modify the same object without an intervening sequence point (really, it applies to scalar objects, because other objects are either non-modifiable (arrays) or just aren't applicable to this rule (class objects)). Behavior is also undefined if a <em>previous</em> value is read from the object but there is a modification too, as in <code>i * i++</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>// This yields to undefined behavior!\n// Left 'i' is not guaranteed to read new value:\n\n    V(i)        E(i++) -&gt; { S(increment, i) })\n      \\         /\n       +---+---+\n           |\n       E(i * i++)\n           |\n           %\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As an exception, it's allowed to read the value of the object if it is needed for computing the new value. This is the case in <code>i = i + 1</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>                V(i)        E(1)\n                   \\         /\n                    +---+---+\n                        |\n  E(i)              E(i + 1)\n     \\                 /\n      +-------+-------+\n              |\n        E(i = i + 1) -&gt; { S(assign, i) }\n              |\n              %\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As we see here, the value of <code>i</code> is read on the right side and after the evaluation of both sides the assignment takes place. So we have a side effect and the read of <code>i</code>'s value without an intervening sequence point, but the read was only to determine the value to be stored into <code>i</code>, so it is fine. </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, a value is read after a modification was done. This is the case for <code>a = (b = 0)</code>, which in C++ will write to <code>b</code> and then read from <code>b</code>, without an intervening sequence point! This however is fine, because it does not read the <em>previous</em> value of <code>b</code>, but the <em>new</em> value of it. In this case, the side effect of the assignment to <em>b</em> has been complete not only before the next sequence point, but also before the read of <code>b</code>, as needed for the assignment to <code>a</code> to get the new value from <code>b</code>. In the spec, this relation is established by explicit constraints, in this case it appertains in particular to <code>b = 0</code> and reads <em>\"The result of the assignment operation is the value stored in the left operand after the assignment has taken place; the result is an lvalue.\"</em> Why not a sequence point to make this relation? Because a sequence point would have the undesirable effect of requiring every side effect that happens in the evaluation of the left and right operand to be complete, instead of doing so only for the assignment in case its resulting lvalue is read from.</p>\n\n<h3>Closing words</h3>\n\n<p>It should be noted that temporaries created in the evaluation of a full-expression are usually not cleaned up before the very next sequence point but only <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4214153/\">when the full-expression has been completely evaluated</a> (in certain situations, the lifetime of temporaries will instead be even longer if there were references bound to them).</p>\n", "title": "Undefined behavior and sequence points", "answer_id": 4190054, "question_id": 4176328, "tags": ["c++", "undefined-behavior", "c++-faq", "sequence-points"]}, {"body": "<p>I am guessing there is a fundamental reason for the change, it isn't merely cosmetic to make the old interpretation clearer: that reason is concurrency.
