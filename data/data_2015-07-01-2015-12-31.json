The best practices behavior is enforced by the <strong>App Transport Security</strong> to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>prevent accidental disclosure, and</li>\n<li>provide a default behavior that is secure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As explained in the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/technotes/App-Transport-Security-Technote/\">App Transport Security Technote</a>, when communicating with your web service, App Transport Security now has the following requirements and behavior:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>The server must support at least Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2.</li>\n  <li>Connection ciphers are limited to those that provide forward secrecy (see the list of ciphers below.)</li>\n  <li>Certificates must be signed using a SHA256 or better signature hash algorithm, with either a 2048 bit or greater RSA key or a 256 bit or\n  greater Elliptic-Curve (ECC) key.</li>\n  <li>Invalid certificates result in a hard failure and no connection.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, your web service request should: a.) use <em>HTTPS</em> and b.) be encrypted using TLS v1.2 with forward secrecy.</p>\n\n<p>However, as was mentioned in other posts, you can override this new behavior from App Transport Security by specifying the insecure domain in the <code>Info.plist</code> of your app.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To override, you will need to add the <code>NSAppTransportSecurity</code> > <code>NSExceptionDomains</code> dictionary properties to your <code>Info.plist</code>. Next, you will add your web service's domain to the <code>NSExceptionDomains</code> dictionary.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if I want to bypass the App Transport Security behavior for a web service on the host <strong>www.yourwebservicehost.com</strong> then I would do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Open your app in Xcode.</p></li>\n<li><p>Find the <code>Info.plist</code> file in Project Navigator and \"right-mouse\" click on it and choose the <em>Open As</em> > <em>Source Code</em> menu option.

The <a href=\"http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html\">Three Principles</a> is more Redux specific though still does not deal with the implementation differences from the standard Flux architecture.</p>\n\n<p>Basically Flux has multiple \"Stores\" that compute state change in response to UI/API interactions with components and broadcast these changes as events that components can subscribe to. In Redux there is only one Store that every component subscribes to. IMO it feels at least like Redux further simplifies and unifies the flow of data by unifying (or reducing as Redux would say) the flow of data back to the components - whereas Flux concentrates on unifying the other side of the data flow - view to model.</p>\n", "title": "Why use Redux over Facebook Flux?", "tags": ["javascript", "reactjs", "reactjs-flux", "flux", "redux"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32461229/why-use-redux-over-facebook-flux/32742821#32742821", "question_id": 32461229, "answer_id": 32742821}, {"body": "<p>Redux author here!  </p>\n\n<p>Redux is not <em>that</em> different from Flux. Overall it's the same architecture, but Redux is able to cut some complexity corners by using functional composition where Flux uses callback registration.</p>\n\n<p>It's not fundamentally different, but I find it that Redux makes certain abstractions easier, or at least possible to implement, that would be hard or impossible to implement in Flux.</p>\n\n<h2>Reducer Composition</h2>\n\n<p>Take, for example, pagination. My <a href=\"https://github.com/gaearon/flux-react-router-example\">Flux + React Router example</a> handles pagination, but the code for that is awful. One of the reasons it's awful is that <strong>Flux makes it unnatural to reuse functionality across stores.</strong> If two stores need to handle pagination in response to different actions, they either need to inherit from a common base store (bad! you're locking yourself into a particular design when you use inheritance), or call a function from the handler, which will need to somehow operate on the Flux store's private state. The whole thing is messy (although definitely in the realm of possible).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, with Redux pagination is natural thanks to reducer composition. It's reducers all the way down, so you can write a <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/ecb1bb453a60408543f5760bba0aa4c767650ba2/examples/real-world/reducers/paginate.js\">reducer factory that generates pagination reducers</a> and then <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/ecb1bb453a60408543f5760bba0aa4c767650ba2/examples/real-world/reducers/index.js#L29-L46\">use it in your reducer tree</a>. The key to why it's so easy is because <strong>in Flux, stores are flat, but in Redux, reducers can be nested via functional composition, just like React components can be nested.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This pattern also enables wonderful features like no-user-code <a href=\"https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo\">undo/redo</a>. <strong>Can you imagine plugging Undo/Redo into a Flux app being two lines of code? Hardly. With Redux, it is</strong>\u2014again, thanks to reducer composition pattern. I need to highlight there's nothing new about it\u2014this is the pattern pioneered and described in detail in <a href=\"https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/\">Elm Architecture</a> which was itself influenced by Flux.</p>\n\n<h2>Server Rendering</h2>\n\n<p>People have been rendering on the server fine with Flux, but seeing that we have 20 Flux libraries each attempting to make server rendering \u201ceasier\u201d, perhaps Flux has some rough edges on the server. The truth is Facebook doesn't do much server rendering, so they haven't been very concerned about it, and rely on the ecosystem to make it easier.</p>\n\n<p>In traditional Flux, stores are singletons. This means it's hard to separate the data for different requests on the server. Not impossible, but hard. This is why most Flux libraries (as well as the new <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/flux-utils.html\">Flux Utils</a>) now suggest you use classes instead of singletons, so you can instantiate stores per request.</p>\n\n<p>There are still the following problems that you need to solve in Flux (either yourself or with the help of your favorite Flux library such as <a href=\"https://github.com/acdlite/flummox\">Flummox</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/goatslacker/alt\">Alt</a>):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If stores are classes, how do I create and destroy them with dispatcher per request? When do I register stores?</li>\n<li>How do I hydrate the data from the stores and later rehydrate it on the client? Do I need to implement special methods for this?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Admittedly Flux frameworks (not vanilla Flux) have solutions to these problems, but I find them overcomplicated. For example, <a href=\"http://acdlite.github.io/flummox/docs/api/store\">Flummox asks you to implement <code>serialize()</code> and <code>deserialize()</code> in your stores</a>. Alt solves this nicer by providing <a href=\"http://alt.js.org/docs/takeSnapshot/\"><code>takeSnapshot()</code></a> that automatically serializes your state in a JSON tree.</p>\n\n<p>Redux just goes further: <strong>since there is just a single store (managed by many reducers), you don't need any special API to manage the (re)hydration.</strong> You don't need to \u201cflush\u201d or \u201chydrate\u201d stores\u2014there's just a single store, and you can read its current state, or create a new store with a new state. Each request gets a separate store instance. <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html\">Read more about server rendering with Redux.</a></p>\n\n<p>Again, this is a case of something possible both in Flux and Redux, but Flux libraries solve this problem by introducing a ton of API and conventions, and Redux doesn't even have to solve it because it doesn't have that problem in the first place thanks to conceptual simplicity.</p>\n\n<h2>Developer Experience</h2>\n\n<p>I didn't actually intend Redux to become a popular Flux library\u2014I wrote it as I was working on my <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs\">ReactEurope talk on hot reloading with time travel</a>. I had one main objective: <strong>make it possible to change reducer code on the fly or even \u201cchange the past\u201d by crossing out actions, and see the state being recalculated.</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a0d66cf145fe35cbe5fb341494b04f277d5d85dd/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4a34476557304d2e676966\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>I haven't seen a single Flux library that is able to do this. React Hot Loader also doesn't let you do this\u2014in fact it breaks if you edit Flux stores because it doesn't know what to do with them.</p>\n\n<p>When Redux needs to reload the reducer code, it calls <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html#replaceReducer\"><code>replaceReducer()</code></a>, and the app runs with the new code. In Flux, data and functions are entangled in Flux stores, so you can't \u201cjust replace the functions\u201d. Moreover, you'd have to somehow re-register the new versions with the Dispatcher\u2014something Redux doesn't even have.</p>\n\n<h2>Ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>Redux has a <a href=\"https://github.com/xgrommx/awesome-redux\">rich and fast-growing ecosystem</a>. This is because it provides a few extension points such as <a href=\"http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html\">middleware</a>. It was designed with use cases such as <a href=\"https://github.com/fcomb/redux-logger\">logging</a>, support for <a href=\"https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise\">Promises</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/acdlite/redux-rx\">Observables</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux\">routing</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/leoasis/redux-immutable-state-invariant\">immutability dev checks</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/elgerlambert/redux-localstorage/\">persistence</a>, etc, in mind. Not all of these will turn out to be useful, but it's nice to have access to a set of tools that can be easily combined to work together.</p>\n\n<h2>Simplicity</h2>\n\n<p>Redux preserves all the benefits of Flux (recording and replaying of actions, unidirectional data flow, dependent mutations) and adds new benefits (easy undo-redo, hot reloading) without introducing Dispatcher and store registration.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping it simple is important because it keeps you sane while you implement higher-level abstractions.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most Flux libraries, Redux API surface is tiny. If you remove the developer warnings, comments, and sanity checks, it's <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/gaearon/ffd88b0e4f00b22c3159\">99 lines</a>. There is no tricky async code to debug.</p>\n\n<p>You can actually read it and understand all of Redux.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/32916602/458193\">my answer on downsides of using Redux compared to Flux</a>.</p>\n", "title": "Why use Redux over Facebook Flux?", "tags": ["javascript", "reactjs", "reactjs-flux", "flux", "redux"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32461229/why-use-redux-over-facebook-flux/32920459#32920459", "question_id": 32461229, "answer_id": 32920459}, {"body": "<p>I'm an early adopter and implemented a mid-large single page application using the Facebook Flux library.</p>\n\n<p>As I'm a little late to the conversation I'll just point out that despite my best hopes Facebook seem to consider their Flux implementation to be a proof of concept and it has never received the attention it deserves.</p>\n\n<p>I'd encourage you to play with it, as it exposes more of the inner working of the Flux architecture which is quite educational, but at the same time it does not provide many of the benefits that libraries like Redux provide (which aren't that important for small projects, but become very valuable for bigger ones).</p>\n\n<p>We have decided that moving forward we will be moving to Redux and I suggest you do the same ;)</p>\n", "title": "Why use Redux over Facebook Flux?", "tags": ["javascript", "reactjs", "reactjs-flux", "flux", "redux"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32461229/why-use-redux-over-facebook-flux/34613221#34613221", "question_id": 32461229, "answer_id": 34613221}], "creation_date": 1441724714, "score": 431, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32461229/why-use-redux-over-facebook-flux", "question_id": 32461229}, {"body": "<p>If I do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; False in [False, True]\nTrue\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That returns <code>True</code>.

When no real guarantee from the compiler provider exists, <strong>we like to say that as-yet unexploited UBs are time bombs</strong>: they\u2019re waiting to go off next month or next year when the compiler gets a bit more aggressive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Matthieu M. points out <a href=\"http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior #2/3</a> is also relevant to this question.

This is true for both the numbers produced by an pseudo-RNG and the seemingly \"random\" numbers found in areas of memory reserved for C/C++ local variables on the stack.</p>\n\n<p>BUT... there is a crucial difference.</p>\n\n<p>The numbers generated by a good pseudorandom generator have the properties that make them statistically similar to truly random draws. For instance, the distribution is uniform. The cycle length is long: you can get millions of random numbers before the cycle repeats itself. The sequence is not autocorrelated: for instance, you will not begin to see strange patterns emerge if you take every 2nd, 3rd, or 27th number, or if you look at specific digits in the generated numbers.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the \"random\" numbers left behind on the stack have none of these properties. Their values and their apparent randomness depend entirely on how the program is constructed, how it is compiled, and how it is optimized by the compiler. By way of example, here is a variation of your idea as a self-contained program:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nnotrandom()\n{\n        int r, g, b;\n\n        printf(\"R=%d, G=%d, B=%d\", r&amp;255, g&amp;255, b&amp;255);\n}\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n        int i;\n        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\n        {\n                notrandom();\n                printf(\"\\n\");\n        }\n\n        return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I compile this code with GCC on a Linux machine and run it, it turns out to be rather unpleasantly deterministic:</p>\n\n<pre><code>R=0, G=19, B=0\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\nR=130, G=16, B=255\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you looked at the compiled code with a disassembler, you could reconstruct what was going on, in detail. The first call to notrandom() used an area of the stack that was not used by this program previously; who knows what was in there. But after that call to notrandom(), there is a call to printf() (which the GCC compiler actually optimizes to a call to putchar(), but never mind) and that overwrites the stack. So the next and subsequent times, when notrandom() is called, the stack will contain stale data from the execution of putchar(), and since putchar() is always called with the same arguments, this stale data will always be the same, too.</p>\n\n<p>So there is absolutely <em>nothing</em> random about this behavior, nor do the numbers obtained this way have any of the desirable properties of a well-written pseudorandom number generator. In fact, in most real-life scenarios, their values will be repetitive and highly correlated.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, as others, I would also seriously consider firing someone who tried to pass off this idea as a \"high performance RNG\".</p>\n", "title": "Is uninitialized local variable the fastest random number generator?", "tags": ["c++", "c", "undefined-behavior", "garbage"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31739792/is-uninitialized-local-variable-the-fastest-random-number-generator/31752816#31752816", "question_id": 31739792, "answer_id": 31752816}, {"body": "<p>There is one more possibility to consider.</p>\n\n<p>Modern compilers (ahem g++) are so intelligent that they go through your code to see what instructions affect state, and what don't, and if an instruction is guaranteed to NOT affect the state, g++ will simply remove that instruction.</p>\n\n<p>So here's what will happen. g++ will definitely see that you are reading, performing arithmetic on, saving, what is essentially a garbage value, which produces more garbage.

This includes various checks like \"Does the file exist?\" and \"Do I have the permissions to open this file for writing?\".</p>\n\n<p>But that's all kernel stuff - unless you're implementing your own toy OS, there isn't much to delve into (if you are, have fun - it's a great learning experience). Of course, you should still learn all the possible error codes you can receive while opening a file, so that you can handle them properly - but those are usually nice little abstractions.</p>\n\n<p>The most important part on the code level is that it gives you a <em>handle</em> to the open file, which you use for all of the other operations you do with a file. Couldn't you use the filename instead of this arbitrary handle? Well, sure - but using a handle gives you some advantages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The system can keep track of all the files that are currently open, and prevent them from being deleted (for example).</li>\n<li>Modern OSs are built around handles - there's tons of useful things you can do with handles, and all the different kinds of handles behave almost identically. For example, when an asynchronous I/O operation completes on a Windows file handle, the handle is signalled - this allows you to block on the handle until it's signalled, or to complete the operation entirely asynchronously. Waiting on a file handle is exactly the same as waiting on a thread handle (signalled e.g. when the thread ends), a process handle (again, signalled when the process ends), or a socket (when some asynchronous operation completes). Just as importantly, handles are owned by their respective processes, so when a process is terminated unexpectedly (or the application is poorly written), the OS knows what handles it can release.</li>\n<li>Most operations are positional - you <code>read</code> from the last position in your file. By using a handle to identify a particular \"opening\" of a file, you can have multiple concurrent handles to the same file, each reading from their own places. In a way, the handle acts as a moveable window into the file (and a way to issue asynchronous I/O requests, which are very handy).</li>\n<li>Handles are <em>much</em> smaller than file names. A handle is usually the size of a pointer, typically 4 or 8 bytes. On the other hand, filenames can have hundreds of bytes.</li>\n<li>Handles allow the OS to <em>move</em> the file, even though applications have it open - the handle is still valid, and it still points to the same file, even though the file name has changed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There's also some other tricks you can do (for example, share handles between processes to have a communication channel <em>without</em> using a physical file; on unix systems, files are also used for devices and various other virtual channels, so this isn't strictly necessary), but they aren't really tied to the <code>open</code> operation itself, so I'm not going to delve into that.</p>\n", "title": "What does opening a file actually do?", "tags": ["c", "linux"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33495283/what-does-opening-a-file-actually-do/33522073#33522073", "question_id": 33495283, "answer_id": 33522073}, {"body": "<p>Basically, a call to open needs to find the file, and then record whatever it needs to so that later I/O operations can find it again. That's quite vague, but it will be true on all the operating systems I can immediately think of. The specifics vary from platform to platform. Many answers already on here talk about modern-day desktop operating systems. I've done a little programming on CP/M, so I will offer my knowledge about how it works on CP/M (MS-DOS probably works in the same way, but for security reasons, it is not normally done like this today).</p>\n\n<p>On CP/M you have a thing called the FCB (as you mentioned C, you could call it a struct; it really is a 35-byte contiguous area in RAM containing various fields). The FCB has fields to write the file-name and a (4-bit) integer identifying the disk drive. Then, when you call the kernel's Open File, you pass a pointer to this struct by placing it in one of the CPU's registers. Some time later, the operating system returns with the struct slightly changed. Whatever I/O you do to this file, you pass a pointer to this struct to the system call.</p>\n\n<p>What does CP/M do with this FCB? It reserves certain fields for its own use, and uses these to keep track of the file, so you had better not ever touch them from inside your program. The Open File operation searches through the table at the start of the disk for a file with the same name as what's in the FCB (the '?' wildcard character matches any character). If it finds a file, it copies some information into the FCB, including the file's physical location(s) on the disk, so that subsequent I/O calls ultimately call the BIOS which may pass these locations to the disk driver.

(I haven't tried older versions.)</p>\n\n<p>Recently, I've been debugging some of my <a href=\"http://nodatime.org\">Noda Time</a> code, and I've noticed that when I've got a local variable of type <code>NodaTime.Instant</code> (one of the central <code>struct</code> types in Noda Time), the \"Locals\" and \"Watch\" windows don't appear to call its <code>ToString()</code> override. If I call <code>ToString()</code> explicitly in the watch window, I see the appropriate representation, but otherwise I just see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>variableName       {NodaTime.Instant}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which isn't very useful.</p>\n\n<p>If I change the override to return a constant string, the string <em>is</em> displayed in the debugger, so it's clearly able to pick up that it's there - it just doesn't want to use it in its \"normal\" state.</p>\n\n<p>I decided to reproduce this locally in a little demo app, and here's what I've come up with. (Note that in an early version of this post, <code>DemoStruct</code> was a class and <code>DemoClass</code> didn't exist at all - my fault, but it explains some comments which look odd now...)</p>\n\n<pre><code>using System;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\nusing System.Threading;\n\npublic struct DemoStruct\n{\n    public string Name { get; }\n\n    public DemoStruct(string name)\n    {\n        Name = name;\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        Thread.Sleep(1000); // Vary this to see different results\n        return $\"Struct: {Name}\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class DemoClass\n{\n    public string Name { get; }\n\n    public DemoClass(string name)\n    {\n        Name = name;\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        Thread.Sleep(1000); // Vary this to see different results\n        return $\"Class: {Name}\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var demoClass = new DemoClass(\"Foo\");\n        var demoStruct = new DemoStruct(\"Bar\");\n        Debugger.Break();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the debugger, I now see:</p>\n\n<pre><code>demoClass    {DemoClass}\ndemoStruct   {Struct: Bar}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, if I reduce the <code>Thread.Sleep</code> call down from 1 second to 900ms, there's still a short pause, but then I see <code>Class: Foo</code> as the value. It doesn't seem to matter how long the <code>Thread.Sleep</code> call is in <code>DemoStruct.ToString()</code>, it's always displayed properly - and the debugger displays the value before the sleep would have completed. (It's as if <code>Thread.Sleep</code> is disabled.)</p>\n\n<p>Now <code>Instant.ToString()</code> in Noda Time does a fair amount of work, but it certainly doesn't take a whole second - so presumably there are more conditions that cause the debugger to give up evaluating a <code>ToString()</code> call. And of course it's a struct anyway.</p>\n\n<p>I've tried recursing to see whether it's a stack limit, but that appears not to be the case.</p>\n\n<p>So, how can I work out what's stopping VS from fully evaluating <code>Instant.ToString()</code>? As noted below, <code>DebuggerDisplayAttribute</code> appears to help, but without knowing <em>why</em>, I'm never going to be entirely confident in when I need it and when I don't.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n\n<p>If I use <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debuggerdisplayattribute.debuggerdisplayattribute\"><code>DebuggerDisplayAttribute</code></a>, things change:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// For the sample code in the question...\n[DebuggerDisplay(\"{ToString()}\")]\npublic class DemoClass\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>gives me:</p>\n\n<pre><code>demoClass      Evaluation timed out\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Whereas when I apply it in Noda Time:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[DebuggerDisplay(\"{ToString()}\")]\npublic struct Instant\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>a simple test app shows me the right result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>instant    \"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So presumably the problem in Noda Time is some condition that <code>DebuggerDisplayAttribute</code> <em>does</em> force through - even though it doesn't force through timeouts. (This would be in line with my expectation that <code>Instant.ToString</code> is easily fast enough to avoid a timeout.)</p>\n\n<p>This <em>may</em> be a good enough solution - but I'd still like to know what's going on, and whether I can change the code simply to avoid having to put the attribute on all the various value types in Noda Time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Curiouser and curiouser</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whatever is confusing the debugger only confuses it sometimes. Let's create a class which <em>holds</em> an <code>Instant</code> and uses it for its own <code>ToString()</code> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>using NodaTime;\nusing System.Diagnostics;\n\npublic class InstantWrapper\n{\n    private readonly Instant instant;\n\n    public InstantWrapper(Instant instant)\n    {\n        this.instant = instant;\n    }\n\n    public override string ToString() =&gt; instant.ToString();\n}\n\npublic class Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        var instant = NodaConstants.UnixEpoch;\n        var wrapper = new InstantWrapper(instant);\n\n        Debugger.Break();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now I end up seeing:</p>\n\n<pre><code>instant    {NodaTime.Instant}\nwrapper    {1970-01-01T00:00:00Z}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, at the suggestion of Eren in comments, if I change <code>InstantWrapper</code> to be a struct, I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>instant    {NodaTime.Instant}\nwrapper    {InstantWrapper}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So it <em>can</em> evaluate <code>Instant.ToString()</code> - so long as that's invoked by another <code>ToString</code> method... which is within a class. The class/struct part seems to be important based on the type of the variable being displayed, not what code needs \nto be executed in order to get the result.</p>\n\n<p>As another example of this, if we use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>object boxed = NodaConstants.UnixEpoch;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... then it works fine, displaying the right value. Colour me confused.</p>\n", "tags": ["c#", "debugging", "visual-studio-2015"], "title": "What makes the Visual Studio debugger stop evaluating a ToString override?", "answers": [{"body": "<h1>Update:</h1>\n\n<p>This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 2015 Update 2.  Let me know if you are still running into problems evaluating ToString on struct values using Update 2 or later.</p>\n\n<h1>Original Answer:</h1>\n\n<p>You are running into a known bug/design limitation with Visual Studio 2015 and calling ToString on struct types.  This can also be observed when dealing with <code>System.DateTimeSpan</code>.  <code>System.DateTimeSpan.ToString()</code> works in the evaluation windows with Visual Studio 2013, but does not always work in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in the low level details, here's what's going on:</p>\n\n<p>To evaluate <code>ToString</code>, the debugger does what's known as \"function evaluation\".  In greatly simplified terms, the debugger suspends all threads in the process except the current thread, changes the context of the current thread to the <code>ToString</code> function, sets a hidden guard breakpoint, then allows the process to continue.  When the guard breakpoint is hit, the debugger restores the process to its previous state and the return value of the function is used to populate the window.</p>\n\n<p>To support lambda expressions, we had to completely rewrite the CLR Expression Evaluator in Visual Studio 2015.  At a high level, the implementation is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Roslyn generates MSIL code for expressions/local variables to get the values to be displayed in the various inspection windows.</li>\n<li>The debugger interprets the IL to get the result.</li>\n<li>If there are any \"call\" instructions, the debugger executes a\nfunction evaluation as described above.</li>\n<li>The debugger/roslyn takes this result and formats it into the\ntree-like view that's shown to the user.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Because of the execution of IL, the debugger is always dealing with a complicated mix of \"real\" and \"fake\" values.  Real values actually exist in the process being debugged.  Fake values only exist in the debugger process.  To implement proper struct semantics, the debugger always needs to make a copy of the value when pushing a struct value to the IL stack.  The copied value is no longer a \"real\" value and now only exists in the debugger process.  That means if we later need to perform function evaluation of <code>ToString</code>, we can't because the value doesn't exist in the process.  To try and get the value we need to emulate execution of the <code>ToString</code> method.  While we can emulate some things, there are many limitations.  For example, we can't emulate native code and we can't execute calls to \"real\" delegate values or calls on reflection values.</p>\n\n<p>With all of that in mind, here is what's causing the various behaviors you are seeing:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The debugger isn't evaluating <code>NodaTime.Instant.ToString</code> -> This is\nbecause it is struct type and the implementation of ToString can't\nbe emulated by the debugger as described above.</li>\n<li><code>Thread.Sleep</code> seems to take zero time when called by <code>ToString</code> on a\nstruct -> This is because the emulator is executing <code>ToString</code>.\nThread.Sleep is a native method, but the emulator is aware\nof it and just ignores the call.  We do this to try and get a value\nto show to the user.  A delay wouldn't be helpful in this case.</li>\n<li><code>DisplayAttibute(\"ToString()\")</code> works. -> That is confusing.  The only\ndifference between the implicit calling of <code>ToString</code> and\n<code>DebuggerDisplay</code> is that any time-outs of the implicit <code>ToString</code>\nevaluation will disable all implicit <code>ToString</code> evaluations for that\ntype until the next debug session.  You may be observing that\nbehavior.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In terms of the design problem/bug, this is something we are planning to address in a future release of Visual Studio.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that clears things up.

The one thing that caught my eye was:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'm sampling a data set of billions of elements and every time I need to pick 10 numbers out of it (simplified) and sort them (and make conclusions from the sorted 10 element list).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a software and hardware engineer this absolutely screams <strong>\"FPGA\"</strong> to me.  I don't know what kind of conclusions you need to draw from the sorted set of numbers or where the data comes from but I know it would be almost trivial to process somewhere between <strong>one hundred million and a billion</strong> of these \"sort-and-analyze\" operations <strong>per second</strong>.  I've done FPGA-assisted DNA sequencing work in the past.  It is nearly impossible to beat the massive processing power of FPGA's when the problem is well suited for that type of a solution.</p>\n\n<p>At some level the only limiting factor becomes how quickly you can shovel data into an FPGA and how quickly you can get it out.</p>\n\n<p>As a point of reference, I designed a high performance real-time image processor that received 32 bit RGB image data at a rate of about 300 million pixels per second.  The data streamed through FIR filters, matrix multipliers, lookup tables, spatial edge detection blocks and a number of other operations before coming out the other end.  All of this on a relatively small Xilinx Virtex2 FPGA with internal clocking spanning from about 33MHz to, if I remember correctly, 400MHz.  Oh, yes, it also had a DDR2 controller implementation and ran two banks of DDR2 memory.</p>\n\n<p>An FPGA can output a sort of ten 32 bit number on every clock transition while operating at hundreds of MHz.  There would be short delay at the start of the operation as the data fills the processing pipeline/s.  After that you should be able to get one result per clock.  Or more if the processing can be parallelized through replicating the sort-and-analyze pipeline.  The solution, in principle, is almost trivial.</p>\n\n<p>The point is:  If the application isn't PC-bound and the data stream and processing is \"compatible\" with an FPGA solution (either stand-alone or as a co-processor card in the machine) there is no way you are going to be able to beat the attainable level of performance with software written in any language, regardless of the algorithm.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just ran quick search and found a paper that might be of use to you.

That is, if you find an algorithm that can detect dead code in <em>any</em> program, then you can use that algorithm to test whether <em>any</em> program will halt. Since that has been proven to be impossible, it follows that writing an algorithm for dead code is impossible as well.</p>\n\n<p>How do you transfer an algorithm for dead code into an algorithm for the Halting problem?</p>\n\n<p>Simple: you add a line of code after the end of the program you want to check for halt. If your dead-code detector detects that this line is dead, then you know that the program does not halt. If it doesn't, then you know that your program halts (gets to the last line, and then to your added line of code).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Compilers usually check for things that can be proven at compile-time to be dead. For example, blocks that are dependent on conditions that can be determined to be false at compile time. Or any statement after a <code>return</code> (within the same scope).</p>\n\n<p>These are specific cases, and therefore it's possible to write an algorithm for them.

More programmers think of loops like this as \"while the index is in range\" rather than \"until the index reaches the end.\"  There's value is sticking to convention when you can.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, many answers here are claiming that using the <code>&lt;</code> form helps avoid bugs.  I'd argue that in many cases this just helps <em>hide</em> bugs.  If the loop index is supposed to reach the end value, and, instead, it actually goes beyond it, then there's something happening you didn't expect which may cause a malfunction (or be a side effect of another bug).  The <code>&lt;</code> will likely delay discovery of the bug.  The <code>!=</code> is more likely to lead to a stall, hang, or even a crash, which will help you spot the bug sooner.  The sooner a bug is found, the cheaper it is to fix.</p>\n\n<p>Note that this convention is peculiar to array and vector indexing.  When traversing nearly any other type of data structure, you'd use an iterator (or pointer) and check directly for an end value.  In those cases you have to be sure the iterator will reach and not overshoot the actual end value.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you're stepping through a plain C string, it's generally more common to write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (char *p = foo; *p != '\\0'; ++p) {\n  // do something with *p\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>than</p>\n\n<pre><code>int length = strlen(foo);\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; length; ++i) {\n  // do something with foo[i]\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For one thing, if the string is very long, the second form will be slower because the <code>strlen</code> is another pass through the string.</p>\n\n<p>With a C++ std::string, you'd use a range-based for loop, a standard algorithm, or iterators, even if though the length is readily available.  If you're using iterators, the convention is to use <code>!=</code> rather than <code>&lt;</code>, as in:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (auto it = foo.begin(); it != foo.end(); ++it) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Similarly, iterating a tree or a list or a deque usually involves watching for a null pointer or other sentinel rather than checking if an index remains within a range.</p>\n", "title": "Is there a technical reason to use &gt; (&lt;) instead of != when incrementing by 1 in a &#39;for&#39; loop?", "tags": ["c++", "c", "for-loop"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31455629/is-there-a-technical-reason-to-use-instead-of-when-incrementing-by-1-in/31460419#31460419", "question_id": 31455629, "answer_id": 31460419}, {"body": "<p>I take the adjectival \"technical\" to mean language behavior/quirks and compiler side effects such as performance of generated code.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, the answer is: no(*).

Just explain the problem!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is true even in case the synonyms used in the first version happen to fit the situation better than the conventional words in the English idiom. Similar forces are in effect when programmers read code. This is also why <code>5 != i</code> and <code>5 &gt; i</code> are weird ways of putting it <em>unless</em> you are working in an environment in which it is standard to swap the more normal <code>i != 5</code> and <code>i &lt; 5</code> in this way. Such dialect communities do exist, probably because consistency makes it easier to remember to write <code>5 == i</code> instead of the natural but error prone <code>i == 5</code>.</p>\n", "title": "Is there a technical reason to use &gt; (&lt;) instead of != when incrementing by 1 in a &#39;for&#39; loop?", "tags": ["c++", "c", "for-loop"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31455629/is-there-a-technical-reason-to-use-instead-of-when-incrementing-by-1-in/31474054#31474054", "question_id": 31455629, "answer_id": 31474054}, {"body": "<p>One reason not to use this construct is floating point numbers. <code>!=</code> is a very dangerous comparison to use with floats as it'll rarely evaluate to true even if the numbers look the same. <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> removes this risk.</p>\n", "title": "Is there a technical reason to use &gt; (&lt;) instead of != when incrementing by 1 in a &#39;for&#39; loop?", "tags": ["c++", "c", "for-loop"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31455629/is-there-a-technical-reason-to-use-instead-of-when-incrementing-by-1-in/31474399#31474399", "question_id": 31455629, "answer_id": 31474399}, {"body": "<p>Yes; OpenMP doesn't parallelize loops with the <code>!=</code> conditoin.</p>\n", "title": "Is there a technical reason to use &gt; (&lt;) instead of != when incrementing by 1 in a &#39;for&#39; loop?", "tags": ["c++", "c", "for-loop"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31455629/is-there-a-technical-reason-to-use-instead-of-when-incrementing-by-1-in/31474750#31474750", "question_id": 31455629, "answer_id": 31474750}, {"body": "<p>As already said by Ian Newson, you can't reliably loop over a floating variable and exit with <code>!=</code>.

In many languages -- C, JavaScript, and many others -- it is perfectly legal to use an expression as a statement.  <code>2 + 2;</code> is legal in these languages, even though this is a statement that has no effect. Some expressions are useful only for their values, some expressions are useful only for their side effects (such as a call to a void returning method) and some expressions, unfortunately, are useful for both. (Like increment.)</p>\n\n<p>Point being: statements that consist only of expressions are almost certainly errors <em>unless those expressions are typically thought of as more useful for their side effects than their values</em>. C# designers wished to find a middle ground, by allowing expressions that were generally thought of as side-effecting, while disallowing those that are also typically thought of as useful for their values.  The set of expressions they identified in C# 1.0 were increments, decrements, method calls, assignments, and somewhat controversially, constructor invocations. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>ASIDE: One normally thinks of an object construction as being used for the value it produces, not for the side effect of the construction; in my opinion allowing <code>new Foo();</code> is a bit of a misfeature. In particular, I've seen this pattern in real-world code that caused a security defect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>catch(FooException ex) { new BarException(ex); } \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It can be surprisingly hard to spot this defect if the code is complicated.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The compiler therefore works to detect all statements that consist of expressions that are not on that list. In particular, parenthesized expressions are identified as just that -- parenthesized expressions.  They are not on the list of \"allowed as statement expressions\", so they are disallowed.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is in service of a design principle of the C# language. <strong>If you typed <code>(x++);</code> you were probably doing something wrong</strong>. This is probably a typo for <code>M(x++);</code> or some just thing. Remember, the attitude of the C# compiler team is not \"<em>can we figure out some way to make this work?</em>\"  The attitude of the C# compiler team is \"<em>if plausible code looks like a likely mistake, let's inform the developer</em>\".  C# developers like that attitude.</p>\n\n<p>Now, all that said, there actually are a few odd cases where the C# specification <em>does</em> imply or state outright that parentheses are disallowed but the C# compiler allows them anyways. In almost all those cases the minor discrepancy between the specified behaviour and the allowed behaviour is completely harmless, so the compiler writers have never fixed these small bugs.

If the system headers bothered to declare <code>free</code> at all, they would have done it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>extern free();  /* no `void` return type either! */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the key point here is that the absence of function prototypes meant the compiler did <em>no argument type checking</em>.  It applied the default argument promotions (the same ones that still apply to variadic function calls) and that was it.  Responsibility for making the arguments at each callsite line up with the callee's expectations lay <em>entirely</em> with the programmer.</p>\n\n<p>However, this still doesn't mean it was necessary to cast the argument to <code>free</code> on most K&amp;R compilers.  A function like</p>\n\n<pre><code>free_stuff(a, b, c)\n    float *a;\n    char *b;\n    int *c;\n{\n    free(a);\n    free(b);\n    free(c);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>should have been compiled correctly.  So I think what we've got here is a program written to cope with a buggy compiler for an unusual environment: for instance, an environment where <code>sizeof(float *) &gt; sizeof(int)</code> and the compiler <em>wouldn't</em> use the appropriate calling convention for pointers unless you cast them at the point of the call.</p>\n\n<p>I am not aware of any such environment, but that doesn't mean there wasn't one.

Instead, always use <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "What is the difference between (NaN != NaN) and (NaN !== NaN)?", "tags": ["javascript", "nan"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34261938/what-is-the-difference-between-nan-nan-and-nan-nan/34262413#34262413", "question_id": 34261938, "answer_id": 34262413}, {"body": "<p>First, let me point out that <code>NaN</code> is a very special value: By definition, it's not equal to itself. That comes from the IEEE-754 standard that JavaScript numbers draw on. The \"not a number\" value is never equal to itself, even when the bits are an exact match. (Which they aren't necessarily in IEEE-754, it allows for multiple different \"not a number\" values.) Which is why this even comes up; all other values in JavaScript are equal to themselves, <code>NaN</code> is just special.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...am I missing some value in JavaScript that will return true for x !== x and false for x != x?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, you're not. The only difference between <code>!==</code> and <code>!=</code> is that the latter will do type coercion if necessary to get the types of the operands to be the same. In <code>x != x</code>, the types of the operands are the same, and so it's exactly the same as <code>x !== x</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This is clear from the beginning of the definition of the <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-abstract-equality-comparison\">Abstract Equality Operation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>ReturnIfAbrupt(x).</li>\n  <li>ReturnIfAbrupt(y).</li>\n  <li><p>If Type(x) is the same as Type(y), then</p>\n  \n  <p>Return the result of performing Strict Equality Comparison x === y.</p></li>\n  <li><p>...</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first two steps are basic plumbing. So in effect, the very first step of <code>==</code> is to see if the types are the same and, if so, to do <code>===</code> instead. <code>!=</code> and <code>!==</code> are just negated versions of that.</p>\n\n<p>So if Flanagan is correct that only <code>NaN</code> will give true for <code>x !== x</code>, we can be sure that it's also true that only <code>NaN</code> will give true for <code>x != x</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Many JavaScript programmers default to using <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code> to avoid some pitfalls around the type coercion the loose operators do, but there's nothing to read into Flanagan's use of the strict vs. loose operator in this case.</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between (NaN != NaN) and (NaN !== NaN)?", "tags": ["javascript", "nan"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34261938/what-is-the-difference-between-nan-nan-and-nan-nan/34263129#34263129", "question_id": 34261938, "answer_id": 34263129}, {"body": "<p>Just for fun, let me show you an artificial example where <code>x</code> is not <code>NaN</code> but the operators behave differently anyway.

In the program below, we'll see how we can force all three values to be identical.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The behavior in this program is undefined, but I'm posting it here purely as an interesting demonstration of something that pointers <em>can</em> do, but <em>shouldn't</em>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main () {\n  int *(*x)[5];\n\n  x = (int *(*)[5]) &amp;x;\n\n  printf(\"%p\\n\", x[0]);\n  printf(\"%p\\n\", x[0][0]);\n  printf(\"%p\\n\", x[0][0][0]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This compiles without warnings in both C89 and C99, and the output is the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ./ptrs\n0xbfd9198c\n0xbfd9198c\n0xbfd9198c\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interestingly enough, all three values are identical. But this shouldn't be a surprise! First, let's break down the program.</p>\n\n<p>We declare <code>x</code> as a pointer to an array of 5 elements where each element is of type pointer to int. This declaration allocates 4 bytes on the runtime stack (or more depending on your implementation; on my machine pointers are 4 bytes), so <code>x</code> is referring to an actual memory location. In the C family of languages, the contents of <code>x</code> are just garbage, something left over from previous usage of the location, so <code>x</code> itself doesn't point anywhere&mdash;certainly not to allocated space.</p>\n\n<p>So, naturally, we can take the address of the variable <code>x</code> and put it somewhere, so that's exactly what we do. But we'll go ahead and put it into x itself. Since <code>&amp;x</code> has a different type than <code>x</code>, we need to do a cast so we don't get warnings.</p>\n\n<p>The memory model would look something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0xbfd9198c\n+------------+\n| 0xbfd9198c |\n+------------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the 4-byte block of memory at the address <code>0xbfd9198c</code> contains the bit pattern corresponding to the hexadecimal value <code>0xbfd9198c</code>. Simple enough.</p>\n\n<p>Next, we print out the three values. The other answers explain what each expression refers to, so the relationship should be clear now.</p>\n\n<p>We can see that the values are the same, but only in a very low level sense...their bit patterns are identical, but the type data associated with each expression means their interpreted values are different.\nFor instance, if we printed out <code>x[0][0][0]</code> using the format string <code>%d</code>, we'd get a huge negative number, so the \"values\" are, in practice, different, but the bit pattern is the same.</p>\n\n<p>This is actually really simple...in the diagrams, the arrows just point to the same memory address rather than to different ones. However, while we were able to force an expected result out of undefined behavior, it is just that&mdash;undefined. This isn't production code but simply a demonstration for the sake of completeness.</p>\n\n<p>In a reasonable situation, you will use <code>malloc</code> to create the array of 5 int pointers, and again to create the ints that are pointed to in that array. <code>malloc</code> always returns a unique address (unless you're out of memory, in which case it returns NULL or 0), so you'll never have to worry about self-referential pointers like this.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that's the complete answer you're looking for. You shouldn't expect <code>x[0]</code>, <code>x[0][0]</code>, and <code>x[0][0][0]</code> to be equal, but they could be if forced.

The kernel then looks up the page in its own data structures, and finds that you should have a zero page there, so it maps in a zero page (possibly first evicting a page from page-cache) and returns from the interrupt.

That's because all memory allocation from the kernel to a process is done at memory page granularity, which is, in turn, because of the hardware that does not allow paging at smaller granularities.</p>\n", "title": "Why doesn&#39;t this memory eater really eat memory?", "tags": ["c", "linux", "memory", "virtual-memory"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33234139/why-doesnt-this-memory-eater-really-eat-memory/33235163#33235163", "question_id": 33234139, "answer_id": 33235163}], "creation_date": 1445336667, "score": 140, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33234139/why-doesnt-this-memory-eater-really-eat-memory", "question_id": 33234139}, {"body": "<p>I am trying to convert an IntelliJ project to the Gradle system of Android Studio but I am running into errors with Apache HttpClient?

Unfortunately we need it if we want to use expansion files. The solution has been provided by a few people here, but for me the answers were missing a few minor detail that could have saved a lot of time for me. Here is the sequence of events for novices like me to save your precious time.</p>\n\n<p>First I imported the \"library\" folder from D:\\Users\\Imre\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk1\\extras\\google\\play_licensing to the project by going into File, New, Import Module and navigating to the \"library\" folder. If you open the SDK Manager and click on \"Launch Standalone SDK Manager\" in the bottom of the popup screen, you can hover your pointer over the \"Extras\" folder down in the bottom and the small yellow info will tell you where you will find the package that you need to import.</p>\n\n<p>Once that is done, go down to the \"library\" section in the left pane with \"Project\" and within it the \"Android\" tab open. Open the java section of the library and open the APKExpansionPolicy class.\nIf you have errors and the import org.apache.http.NameValuePair and the import org.apache.http.client.utils.URLEncodedUtils are pale grey, open the build.gradle(Project:whatever) and make sure that in \"buildscript\" under \"dependancies\" you have the \"classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.5.0\" included. The 1.5.0 might be different in your case. I guess it depends on your Studio version. Mine is 1.5.1. If yours is newer, you will be reminded to update the numbers.</p>\n\n<p>After that, go to \"build.gradle(Module:library) and include the \"useLibrary 'org.apache.http.legacy' into the \"android\"section. Sync Now (R/H top corner) should be offered. Do it.</p>\n\n<p>If you get further error messages (I wouldn't know it because I did it the other way round), the Apache files might be missing from your project, as apache is not supported anymore. Find them in C/D:Users/Yourname/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platforms/android-23/optional and copy/paste them into yourproject/app/libs folder. You should have an optional.json and an org.apache.http.legacy.jar file in there. You might be better off going to apache's website and dowloading the newest version: <a href=\"http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi</a> Unzip it anywhere you want, open it, go to \"lib\", copy the httpclient-4.5.1.jar file and replace the org.apache.http.legacy.jar file with it. </p>\n\n<p>Sync and rebuild/clean your project and it should be good to go.</p>\n\n<p>Just in case, open your terminal (L/H bottom of Android Studio) and type in \"gradlew clean\". It will install a few things. Once it is done, type in \"gradlew assemble\". It will take a few minutes to finish, but it will give you the errors if you have any of course.\nIf you cannot type in anything in the Terminal, launch command prompt (Windows button+R), type in cmd, hit OK, right click on the title of the small black popup screen (C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe), Properties, Options, in the bottom of the window check that \"Use legacy console\" is thicked.

The answer is that in a hash table the only comparison we ever require is one for equality. Thus it is more <em>logically consistent</em> (i.e. makes more sense to the library user) to require them to to define an equality operator. Requiring an <code>operator&lt;</code> would be confusing because it's not immediately obvious why you'd need it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "Why is inequality tested as (!(a==b)) in a lot of C++ standard library code?", "tags": ["c++"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32849625/why-is-inequality-tested-as-a-b-in-a-lot-of-c-standard-library-code/32850641#32850641", "question_id": 32849625, "answer_id": 32850641}, {"body": "<p>The <code>EqualityComparable</code> concept <em>only</em> requires that <code>operator==</code> be defined. </p>\n\n<p>Consequently, any function that professes to work with types satisfying <code>EqualityComparable</code> <em>cannot</em> rely on the existence of <code>operator!=</code> for objects of that type.

Comparing the two worlds is very hard. Rx is a port of what Reactive Extensions are in other languages like C#, Java or JS.</p>\n\n<p>Reactive Cocoa was inspired by <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em>, but in the last months, has been also pointed as <em>inspired by Reactive Extensions</em> as well. The outcome is a framework that shares some things with Rx, but has names with origins in FRP.</p>\n\n<p>The first thing to say is that neither RAC nor RxSwift are <em>Functional Reactive Programming</em> implementations, according to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1030631/253315\">Conal's definition</a> of the concept. From this point everything can be reduced to how each framework handles side effects and a few other components.</p>\n\n<p>Let's talk about the community and <em>meta-tech</em> stuff:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>RAC is a 3 years old project, born in Objective-C later ported to Swift (with bridges) for the 3.0 release, after completely dropping the ongoing work on Objective-C. </li>\n<li>RxSwift is a few months old project and seems to have a momentum in the community right now. One thing that is important for RxSwift is that is under the <a href=\"http://reactivex.io/\">ReactiveX</a> organization and that all other implementations are working in the same way, learning how to deal with RxSwift will make working with Rx.Net, RxJava or RxJS a simple task and just a matter of language syntax. I could say that is based on the philosophy <em>learn once, apply everywhere</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now it's time for the tech stuff.</p>\n\n<h2>Producing/Observing Entities</h2>\n\n<p>RAC 3.0 has 2 main entities, <code>Signal</code> and <code>SignalProducer</code>, the first one publishes events regardless a subscriber is attached or not, the second one requires a <code>start</code> to actually having signals/events produced. This design has been created to separate the tedious concept of hot and cold observables, that has been source of confusion for a lot of developers. This is why the <strong>differences can be reduced to how they manage side effects</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>In RxSwift, <code>Signal</code> and <code>SignalProducer</code> translates to <code>Observable</code>, it could sound confusing, but these 2 entities are actually the same thing in the Rx world. A design with <code>Observable</code>s in RxSwift has to be created considering if they are hot or cold, it could sound as unnecessary complexity, but once you understood how they work (and again hot/cold/warm is just about the side effects while subscribing/observing) they can be tamed.</p>\n\n<p>In both worlds, the concept of subscription is basically the same, there's one little difference that RAC introduced and is the <code>interruption</code> event when a <code>Signal</code> is disposed before the completion event has been sent.\nTo recap both have the following kind of events:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Next</code>, to compute the new received value</li>\n<li><code>Error</code>, to compute an error and complete the stream, unsubscribing all the observers</li>\n<li><code>Complete</code>, to mark the stream as completed unsubscribing all observers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>RAC in addition has <code>interrupted</code> that is sent when a <code>Signal</code> is disposed before completing either correctly or with an error.</p>\n\n<h2>Manually Writing</h2>\n\n<p>In RAC, <code>Signal</code>/<code>SignalProducer</code> are read-only entities, they can't be managed from outside, same thing is for <code>Observable</code> in RxSwift. To turn a <code>Signal</code>/<code>SignalProducer</code> into a write-able entity, you have to use the <code>pipe()</code> function to return a manually controlled item. On the Rx space, this is a different type called <code>Subject</code>. </p>\n\n<p>If the read/write concept sounds unfamiliar, a nice analogy with <code>Future</code>/<code>Promise</code> can be made. A <code>Future</code> is a read-only placeholder, like <code>Signal</code>/<code>SignalProducer</code> and <code>Observable</code>, on the other hand, a <code>Promise</code> can be fulfilled manually, like for <code>pipe()</code> and <code>Subject</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Schedulers</h2>\n\n<p>This entity is pretty much similar in both worlds, same concepts, but RAC is serial-only, instead RxSwift features also concurrent schedulers. </p>\n\n<h2>Composition</h2>\n\n<p>Composition is the key feature of Reactive Programming. Composing streams is the essence of both frameworks, in RxSwift they are also called <em>sequences</em>. </p>\n\n<p>All the observable entities in RxSwift are of type <code>ObservableType</code>, so we compose instances of <code>Subject</code> and <code>Observable</code> with the same operators, without any extra concern.</p>\n\n<p>On RAC space, <code>Signal</code> and <code>SignalProducer</code> are 2 different entities and we have to <code>lift</code> on <code>SignalProducer</code> to be able to compose what is produced with instances of <code>Signal</code>. The two entities have their own operators, so when you need to mix things, you have to make sure a certain operator is available, on the other side you forget about the hot/cold observables.</p>\n\n<p>About this part, <a href=\"http://blog.scottlogic.com/2015/04/28/reactive-cocoa-3-continued.html\">Colin Eberhardt</a> summed it nicely:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Looking at the current API the signal operations are mainly focussed on the \u2018next\u2019 event, allowing you to transform values, skip, delay, combine and observe on different threads. Whereas the signal producer API is mostly concerned with the signal lifecycle events (completed, error), with operations including then, flatMap, takeUntil and catch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Extra</h2>\n\n<p>RAC has also the concept of <code>Action</code> and <code>Property</code>, the former is a type to compute side effects, mainly relating to user interaction, the latter is interesting when observing a value to perform a task when the value has changed. In RxSwift the <code>Action</code> translates again into an <code>Observable</code>, this is nicely shown in <code>RxCocoa</code>, an integration of Rx primitives for both iOS and Mac. The RAC's <code>Property</code> can be translated into <code>Variable</code> (or <code>BehaviourSubject</code>) in RxSwift. </p>\n\n<p>It's important to understand that <code>Property</code>/<code>Variable</code> is the way we have to bridge the imperative world to the declarative nature of Reactive Programming, so sometimes is a fundamental component when dealing with third party libraries or core functionalities of the iOS/Mac space.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>RAC and RxSwift are 2 complete different beasts, the former has a long history in the Cocoa space and a lot of contributors, the latter is fairly young, but relies on concepts that have been proven to be effective in other languages like Java, JS or .NET. The decision on which is better is on preference. RAC states that the separation of hot/cold observable was necessary and that is the core feature of the framework, RxSwift says that the unification of them is better than the separation, again it's just about how side effects are managed/performed. </p>\n\n<p>RAC 3.0 seems to have introduced some unexpected complexity on top of the major goal of separating hot/cold observables, like the concept of interruption, splitting operators between 2 entities and introducing some imperative behaviour like <code>start</code> to begin producing signals. For some people these things can be a nice thing to have or even a killer feature, for some others they can be just unnecessary or even dangerous. Another thing to remember is that RAC is trying to keep up with Cocoa conventions as much as possible, so if you are an experienced Cocoa Dev, you <strong>should</strong> feel more comfortable to work with it rather than RxSwift.</p>\n\n<p>RxSwift on the other hand lives with all the downsides like hot/cold observables, but also the good things, of Reactive Extensions. Moving from RxJS, RxJava or Rx.Net to RxSwift is a simple thing, all the concepts are the same, so this makes finding material pretty interesting, maybe the same problem you are facing now, has been solved by someone in RxJava and the solution can be reapplied taking in consideration the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Which one has to be picked is definitely a matter of preference, from an objective perspective is impossible to tell which one is better. The only way is to fire Xcode and try both of them and pick the one that feels more comfortable to work with. They are 2 implementations of similar concepts, trying to achieve the same goal: simplifying software development.</p>\n", "title": "ReactiveCocoa vs RxSwift - pros and cons?", "tags": ["swift", "reactive-cocoa-3", "rx-swift"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32542846/reactivecocoa-vs-rxswift-pros-and-cons/32581824#32581824", "question_id": 32542846, "answer_id": 32581824}], "creation_date": 1442086181, "score": 136, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32542846/reactivecocoa-vs-rxswift-pros-and-cons", "question_id": 32542846}, {"body": "<p>Please note that this error message is pretty low level, so it crops up for different reasons in different scenarios.

Biggest difference is that it uses a single store that wraps a state object containing all the state for your application. Instead of creating stores like you'll do in Flux, you'll write reducer functions that will change a single object state. This object represent all the state in your app. In Redux you will get the current action and state, and return a new state. That mean that actions are sequential and state is immutable. That bring me to the most obvious con in Redux (in my opinion).</p>\n\n<p><hr>\nRedux is supporting an <a href=\"http://www.sitepoint.com/immutability-javascript/\">immutable</a> concept.<br><br></p>\n\n<h2>Why Immutability?</h2>\n\n<p>There are few reasons for that:<br>\n1. <strong>Coherence</strong> - store's state is always being changed by a reducer so it's easy tracking who change what.<br>\n2. <strong>Performance</strong> - because it's immutable, Redux only need to check if previous state !== current state and if so to render. No need to loop the state every single time to determined rendering.<br>\n3. <strong>Debugging</strong> - new awesome concepts like <a href=\"https://code-cartoons.com/hot-reloading-and-time-travel-debugging-what-are-they-3c8ed2812f35#.xp9or7uxg\">Time Travel Debugging</a> and <a href=\"https://code-cartoons.com/hot-reloading-and-time-travel-debugging-what-are-they-3c8ed2812f35#.xp9or7uxg\">Hot Reloading</a>.<br></p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: if that wasn't persuading enough, watch <a href=\"https://github.com/leebyron\">Lee Byron</a> excellent talk about <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/166790294\">Immutable User Interfaces</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Redux require a developer(s) discipline through the codebase/libraries to maintain this idea.

However, this only exists at compile-time - the compiled bytecode no longer has any notion of generics; all the generic types are transformed into \"concrete\" types (using <code>object</code> if the generic type is unbounded), adding type conversions and type checks as needed.</p>\n\n<p>In .NET, generics are an integral feature of the CLR. When you compile a generic type, it stays generic in the generated IL. It's not just transformed into non-generic code as in Java.</p>\n\n<p>This has several impacts on how generics work in practice. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Java has <code>SomeType&lt;?&gt;</code> to allow you to pass any concrete implementation of a given generic type. C# cannot do this - every specific (<em>reified</em>) generic type is its own type.</li>\n<li>Unbounded generic types in Java mean that their value is stored as an <code>object</code>. This can have a performance impact when using value types in such generics. In C#, when you use a value type in a generic type, it stays a value type.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To give a sample, let's suppose you have a <code>List</code> generic type with one generic argument. In Java, <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;Int&gt;</code> will end up being the exact same type at runtime - the generic types only really exist for compile-time code. All calls to e.g. <code>GetValue</code> will be transformed to <code>(String)GetValue</code> and <code>(Int)GetValue</code> respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In C#, <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> are two different types. They are not interchangeable, and their type-safety is enforced in runtime as well. No matter what you do, <code>new List&lt;int&gt;().Add(\"SomeString\")</code> will <em>never</em> work - the underlying storage in <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> is <em>really</em> some integer array, while in Java, it is necessarily an <code>object</code> array. In C#, there are no casts involved, no boxing etc.</p>\n\n<p>This should also make it obvious why C# can't do the same thing as Java with <code>SomeType&lt;?&gt;</code>. In Java, all generic types \"derived from\" <code>SomeType&lt;?&gt;</code> end up being the exact same type. In C#, all the various specific <code>SomeType&lt;T&gt;</code>s are their own separate type. Removing compile-time checks, it's possible to pass <code>SomeType&lt;Int&gt;</code> instead of <code>SomeType&lt;String&gt;</code> (and really, all that <code>SomeType&lt;?&gt;</code> means is \"ignore compile-time checks for the given generic type\"). In C#, it's not possible, not even for derived types (that is, you can't do <code>List&lt;object&gt; list = (List&lt;object&gt;)new List&lt;string&gt;();</code> even though <code>string</code> is derived from <code>object</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Both implementations have their pros and cons. There's been a few times when I'd have loved to be able to just allow <code>SomeType&lt;?&gt;</code> as an argument in C# - but it simply doesn't make sense the way C# generics work.</p>\n", "title": "What is reification?", "tags": ["c#", "generics", "reification"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31876372/what-is-reification/31876755#31876755", "question_id": 31876372, "answer_id": 31876755}, {"body": "<p><em>Reification</em> means generally (outside of computer science) \"to make something real\".</p>\n\n<p>In programming, something is <em>reified</em> if we're able to access information about it in the language itself.</p>\n\n<p>For two completely non-generics-related examples of something C# does and doesn't have reified, let's take methods and memory access.</p>\n\n<p>OO languages generally have <em>methods</em>, (and many that don't have <em>functions</em> that are similar though not bound to a class).

Methods in C# are \"first class objects\".</p>\n\n<p>All practical languages have some means to access the memory of a computer. In a low-level language like C we can deal directly with the mapping between numeric addresses used by the computer, so the likes of <code>int* ptr = (int*) 0xA000000; *ptr = 42;</code> is reasonable (as long as we've a good reason to suspect that accessing memory address <code>0xA000000</code> in this way won't blow something up). In C# this isn't reasonable (we can just about force it in .NET, but with the .NET memory management moving things around it's not very likely to be useful). C# does not have reified memory addresses.</p>\n\n<p>So, as <em>refied</em> means \"made real\" a \"reified type\" is a type we can \"talk about\" in the language in question.</p>\n\n<p>In generics this means two things.</p>\n\n<p>One is that <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> is a type just as <code>string</code> or <code>int</code> are. We can compare that type, get its name, and enquire about it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Console.WriteLine(typeof(List&lt;string&gt;).FullName); // System.Collections.Generic.List`1[[System.String, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089]]\nConsole.WriteLine(typeof(List&lt;string&gt;) == (42).GetType()); // False\nConsole.WriteLine(typeof(List&lt;string&gt;) == Enumerable.Range(0, 1).Select(i =&gt; i.ToString()).ToList().GetType()); // True\nConsole.WriteLine(typeof(List&lt;string&gt;).GenericTypeArguments[0] == typeof(string)); // True\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A consequence of this is that we can \"talk about\" a generic method's (or method of a generic class) parameters' types within the method itself:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static void DescribeType&lt;T&gt;(T element)\n{\n  Console.WriteLine(typeof(T).FullName);\n}\npublic static void Main()\n{\n  DescribeType(42);               // System.Int32\n  DescribeType(42L);              // System.Int64\n  DescribeType(DateTime.UtcNow);  // System.DateTime\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a rule, doing this too much is \"smelly\", but it has many useful cases. For example, look at:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static TSource Min&lt;TSource&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;TSource&gt; source)\n{\n  if (source == null) throw Error.ArgumentNull(\"source\");\n  Comparer&lt;TSource&gt; comparer = Comparer&lt;TSource&gt;.Default;\n  TSource value = default(TSource);\n  if (value == null)\n  {\n    using (IEnumerator&lt;TSource&gt; e = source.GetEnumerator())\n    {\n      do\n      {\n        if (!e.MoveNext()) return value;\n        value = e.Current;\n      } while (value == null);\n      while (e.MoveNext())\n      {\n        TSource x = e.Current;\n        if (x != null &amp;&amp; comparer.Compare(x, value) &lt; 0) value = x;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  else\n  {\n    using (IEnumerator&lt;TSource&gt; e = source.GetEnumerator())\n    {\n      if (!e.MoveNext()) throw Error.NoElements();\n      value = e.Current;\n      while (e.MoveNext())\n      {\n        TSource x = e.Current;\n        if (comparer.Compare(x, value) &lt; 0) value = x;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return value;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This doesn't do lots of comparisons between the type of <code>TSource</code> and various types for different behaviours (generally a sign that you shouldn't have used generics at all) but it does split between a code path for types that can be <code>null</code> (should return <code>null</code> if no element found, and must not make comparisons to find the minimum if one of the elements compared is <code>null</code>) and the code path for types that cannot be <code>null</code> (should throw if no element found, and doesn't have to worry about the possibility of <code>null</code> elements).</p>\n\n<p>Because <code>TSource</code> is \"real\" within the method, this comparison can be made either at runtime or jitting time (generally jitting time, certainly the above case would do so at jitting time and not produce machine code for the path not taken) and we have a separate \"real\" version of the method for each case. (Though as an optimisation, the machine code is shared for different methods for different reference-type type parameters, because it can be without affecting this, and hence we can reduce the amount of machine code jitted).</p>\n\n<p>(It's not common to talk about reification of generic types in C# unless you also deal with Java, because in C# we just take this reification for granted; all types are reified. In Java, non-generic types are referred to as <em>reified</em> because that is a distinction between them and generic types).</p>\n", "title": "What is reification?", "tags": ["c#", "generics", "reification"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31876372/what-is-reification/31877092#31877092", "question_id": 31876372, "answer_id": 31877092}], "creation_date": 1438945994, "score": 118, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31876372/what-is-reification", "question_id": 31876372}, {"body": "<p>I am not able to install and run <code>fakes3</code> gem on El Capitan Beta 5.</p>\n\n<p>I tried:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo gem install fakes3\nERROR:  While executing gem ...

Note, however, that operations on bit strings \u2014 copy, negate, abs, copySign \u2014 specify the sign bit of a NaN result, sometimes based upon the sign bit of a NaN operand. The logical predicate totalOrder is also affected by the sign bit of a NaN operand. For all other operations, this standard does not specify the sign bit of a NaN result, even when there is only one input NaN, or when the NaN is produced from an invalid operation.</p>\n  \n  <p>When neither the inputs nor result are NaN, the sign of a product or quotient is the exclusive OR of the operands\u2019 signs; the sign of a sum, or of a difference x \u2212 y regarded as a sum x + (\u2212y), differs from at most\n  one of the addends\u2019 signs; and the sign of the result of conversions, the quantize operation, the roundTo-Integral operations, and the roundToIntegralExact (see 5.3.1) is the sign of the first or only operand. These rules shall apply even when operands or results are zero or infinite.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the sum of two operands with opposite signs (or the difference of two operands with like signs) is exactly zero, the sign of that sum (or difference) shall be +0 in all rounding-direction attributes except roundTowardNegative; under that attribute, the sign of an exact zero sum (or difference) shall be \u22120. However, x + x = x \u2212 (\u2212x) retains the same sign as x even when x is zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>The Case of Addition</h3>\n\n<p>We see that <code>x+0.0</code> produces <code>x</code>, EXCEPT when <code>x</code> is <code>-0.0</code>: In that case we have a sum of two operands with opposite signs whose sum is zero, and \u00a76.3 paragraph 3 rules this addition produces <code>+0.0</code> in the default rounding mode (Round-to-Nearest, Ties-to-Even).</p>\n\n<p>Since <code>+0.0</code> is not <em>bitwise</em> identical to the original <code>-0.0</code>, and that <code>-0.0</code> is a legitimate value that may occur as input, the compiler is obliged to put in the code that will transform potential negative zeros to <code>+0.0</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The summary: Under the default rounding mode, in <code>x+0.0</code>, if <code>x</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>is not</strong> <code>-0.0</code>, then <code>x</code> itself is an acceptable output value.</li>\n<li><strong>is</strong> <code>-0.0</code>, then the output value <em>must be</em> <code>+0.0</code>, which is not bitwise identical to <code>-0.0</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Case of Multiplication</h3>\n\n<p>No such problem occurs with <code>x*1.0</code>. If <code>x</code>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>is a (sub)normal number, <code>x*1.0 == x</code> always.</li>\n<li>is <code>+/- infinity</code>, then the result is <code>+/- infinity</code> of the same sign.</li>\n<li><p>is <code>NaN</code>, then  according to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>IEEE 754 \u00a7 6.2.3 NaN Propagation</h3>\n  \n  <p>An operation that propagates a NaN operand to its result and has a single NaN as an input should produce a NaN with the payload of the input NaN if representable in the destination format.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which means that the exponent and mantissa (though not the sign) of <code>NaN*1.0</code> are <em>recommended</em> to be unchanged from the input <code>NaN</code>. The sign is unspecified in accordance with \u00a76.3p1 above, but an implementation may specify it to be identical to the source <code>NaN</code>.</p></li>\n<li>is <code>+/- 0</code>, then the result is a <code>0</code> with its sign bit XORed with the sign bit of <code>1.0</code>, in agreement with \u00a76.3p2. Since the sign bit of <code>1.0</code> is <code>0</code>, the output value is unchanged from the input. Thus, <code>x*1.0 == x</code> even when <code>x</code> is a (negative) zero.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Value-Changing Optimizations</h3>\n\n<p>The IEEE 754-2008 Standard has the following interesting quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h3>IEEE 754 \u00a7 10.4 Literal meaning and value-changing optimizations</h3>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>The following value-changing transformations, among others, preserve the literal meaning of the source code:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Applying the identity property 0 + x when x is not zero and is not a signaling NaN and the result has the same exponent as x.</li>\n  <li>Applying the identity property 1 \u00d7 x when x is not a signaling NaN and the result has the same exponent as x.</li>\n  <li>Changing the payload or sign bit of a quiet NaN.</li>\n  <li>[...]</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since all NaNs and all infinities share the same exponent, and the correctly rounded result of <code>x+0.0</code> and <code>x*1.0</code> for finite <code>x</code> has exactly the same magnitude as <code>x</code>, their exponent is the same.</p>\n\n<h3>sNaNs</h3>\n\n<p>Signaling NaNs are floating-point trap values; They are special NaN values whose use as a floating-point operand results in an invalid operation exception (SIGFPE). If a loop that triggers an exception were optimized out, the software would no longer behave the same.</p>\n\n<p>However, as user2357112 <em><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33272994/why-does-clang-optimize-away-x-1-0-but-not-x-0-0/33273367#comment54349314_33273367\">points out in the comments</a></em>, the C11 Standard explicitly leaves undefined the behaviour of signaling NaNs (<code>sNaN</code>), so the compiler is allowed to assume they do not occur, and thus that the exceptions that they raise also do not occur. The C++11 standard omits describing a behaviour for signaling NaNs, and thus also leaves it undefined.</p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>Clang and <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FloatingPointMath\" rel=\"nofollow\">GCC</a>, even at <code>-O3</code>, remains IEEE-754 compliant. This means it must keep to the above rules of the IEEE-754 standard. <code>x+0.0</code> is <strong>not bit-identical</strong> to <code>x</code> for all <code>x</code> under those rules, but <code>x*1.0</code> <em>may be chosen to be so</em>: Namely, when we</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Obey the recommendation to pass unchanged the payload of <code>x</code> when it is a NaN.</li>\n<li>Leave the sign bit of a NaN result unchanged by <code>* 1.0</code>.</li>\n<li>Obey the order to XOR the sign bit during a quotient/product, when <code>x</code> is <em>not</em> a NaN.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To enable the IEEE-754-unsafe optimization <code>(x+0.0) -&gt; x</code>, the flag <code>-ffast-math</code> needs to be passed to Clang or GCC.</p>\n", "title": "Why does Clang optimize away x * 1.0 but NOT x +

According to the interactive view of computing, computation is an ongoing interactive process rather than a function-based transformation of an input to an output. Specifically, communication with the outside world happens during the computation, not before or after it. This approach radically changes our understanding of what is computation and how it is modeled.</p>\n  \n  <p>The acceptance of interaction as a new paradigm is hindered by the Strong Church-Turing Thesis (SCT), the widespread belief that Turing Machines (TMs) capture all computation, so models of computation more expressive than TMs are impossible. In this paper, we show that SCT reinterprets the original Church-Turing Thesis (CTT) in a way that Turing never intended; its commonly assumed equivalence to the original is a myth. We identify and analyze the historical reasons for the widespread belief in SCT. Only by accepting that it is false can we begin to adopt interaction as an alternative paradigm of computation </p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "Is this technically an O(1) algorithm for &quot;Hello World&quot;?", "tags": ["c#", ".net", "algorithm", "big-o"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34048740/is-this-technically-an-o1-algorithm-for-hello-world/34048956#34048956", "question_id": 34048740, "answer_id": 34048956}, {"body": "<p>Big-O analysis deals with the amount of processing involved as the amount of data being processed increases without limit.</p>\n\n<p>Here, you're really only dealing with a single object of fixed size.

You also have to add a little more in the way of somewhat unusual (if not outright wrong) definitions to get very far though--particularly, big-O analysis is <em>usually</em> defined in terms of the number of fundamental operations needed to carry out a particular task (but note that complexity can also be considered in terms of things like memory use, not just CPU use/operations carried out).</p>\n\n<p>The number of fundamental operations usually translates fairly closely to time taken, however, so it isn't a huge stretch treat the two as synonymous. Unfortunately, however, we're still stuck with that other part: the amount of data being processed increasing without limit. That being the case, no fixed delay you can impose will really work.

Some people have noted that faster computers will hit the loop faster, causing more operations, but that's irrelevant.  When working with big-O notation, we don't consider the speed of the processor or the exact number of operations.

You can't generally correlate years of execution to any big-O notation.  Eg. There's no way to say 20 years of execution = O(n^87) or anything else for that matter.

That is what you are disputing with your friend - is this the \"input\"?

It takes twenty years, but since big-O does not change up to a constant multiple, O(1) = O(twenty years).</p>\n\n<p>Similar question - what is the runtime of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void sortArrayOfSizeTenMillion(int[] array)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming it does what it says and the input is valid, and the algorithm harnesses a quicksort or bubble sort or anything reasonable, it's O(1).</p>\n", "title": "Is this technically an O(1) algorithm for &quot;Hello World&quot;?", "tags": ["c#", ".net", "algorithm", "big-o"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34048740/is-this-technically-an-o1-algorithm-for-hello-world/34051419#34051419", "question_id": 34048740, "answer_id": 34051419}, {"body": "<p>Although there are a bunch of great answers here, let me rephrase all of them a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Big-O notation exists to describe <em>functions</em>. When applied to analysis of algorithms this requires us to first define some characteristic of this algorithm in terms of a <em>function</em>. The common choice is considering <em>number of steps</em> as a function of <em>input size</em>. As noted in other answers, coming up with such function in your case seems strange, because there is no clearly defined \"input\". We can still try to do it, though:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We can regard your algorithm as a constant function which takes any input of any size, ignores it, waits a fixed amount of time, and finishes. In this case its runtime is <em>f(n) = const</em>, and it is a O(1)-time algorithm. This is what you expected to hear, right? <em>Yes, it is, technically, an O(1)-algorithm</em>.</li>\n<li>We can regard the <code>TwentyYearsLater</code> as the \"input-size\"-like parameter of interest. In this case the runtime is <em>f(n) = (n-x)</em> where <em>x</em> is the \"now time\" at the moment of invocation. When seen this way, it is a O(n)-time algorithm. Expect this counter-argument whenever you go showing your <em>technically O(1)-algorithm</em> to other people.</li>\n<li>Oh, but wait, if <em>k=</em><code>TwentyYearsLater</code> is the input, then its <em>size</em> <em>n</em> is, actually, the number of bits needed to represent it, i.e. <em>n = log(k)</em>. The dependency between the size of the input <em>n</em> and runtime is therefore <em>f(n) = 2^n - x</em>. Seems like your algorithm has just become exponentially slow! <em>Ugh.</em></li>\n<li>Another input to the program is in fact the <em>stream of answers</em> given by the OS to the sequence of <code>DateTime.Now</code> invocations in the loop. We can actually imagine that this whole sequence is provided as input at the moment we run the program. The runtime can then be considered to depend on the property of this sequence - namely its length until the first <code>TwentyYearsLater</code> element. In this case the runtime is again <em>f(n) = n</em> and the algorithm is <em>O(n)</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But then again, in your question you did not even say you were interested in runtime. What if you meant memory use? Depending on how you model the situation you can say the algorithm is O(1)-memory or, perhaps, O(n)-memory (if the implementation of <code>DateTime.Now</code> requires to keep track of the whole invocation sequence somewhy).</p>\n\n<p>And if your goal was to come up with something absurd, why don't you go all in and say that you are interested in how the size of the algorithm's code in pixels on the screen depends on the chosen zoom level. This might be something like <em>f(zoom) = 1/zoom</em> and you can proudly declare your algorithm to be <em>O(1/n)</em>-pixel size!</p>\n", "title": "Is this technically an O(1) algorithm for &quot;Hello World&quot;?", "tags": ["c#", ".net", "algorithm", "big-o"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34048740/is-this-technically-an-o1-algorithm-for-hello-world/34052365#34052365", "question_id": 34048740, "answer_id": 34052365}, {"body": "<h2>No, your code has time complexity of <code>O(2^|&lt;DeltaTime&gt;|)</code>,</h2>\n\n<p>For a proper coding of the current time.<br>\nPlease, let me first apologize for my English.</p>\n\n<h2>What is and how Big O works in CS</h2>\n\n<p>Big O notation <strong>is not used to tie the input of a program with its running time</strong>.<br>\nBig O notation is, leaving rigor behind, a way to express the <strong>asymptotic ratio of two quantities</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of algorithm analysis these two quantities are <strong>not</strong> the input (for which one must first have a \"measure\" function) and the running time.<br>\n<strong>They are the length of the coding of an instance of the problem<sup>1</sup> and a metric of interest.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The commonly used metrics are</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The number of steps required to complete the algorithm in a given model of computation.</li>\n<li>The space required, if any such concept exists, by the model of computation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Implicitly is assumed a TM as the model so that the first point translates to the <em>number of applications of the transition<sup>2</sup> function</em>, i.e. \"steps\", and the second one translates the number of <em>different tape cells written at least once</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Is it also often implicitly assumed that we can use a polynomially related encoding instead of the original one, for example a function that search an array from start to end has <code>O(n)</code> complexity despite the fact that a coding of an instance of such array should have length of <code>n*b+(n-1)</code> where <code>b</code> is the (constant) number of symbols of each element. This is because <code>b</code> is considered a constant of the computation model and so the expression above and <code>n</code> are asymptotically the same.</p>\n\n<p>This also explains why an algorithm like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_division\">Trial Division</a> is an <strong>exponential</strong> algorithm despite essentially being a <code>for(i=2; i&lt;=sqr(N); i++)</code> like algorithm<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_of_computational_complexity\">this</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This also means that big O notation may use as many parameters one may needs to describe the problem, is it not unusual to have a <em>k</em> parameter for some algorithms.  </p>\n\n<p>So this <strong>is not</strong> about the \"input\" or that \"there is no input\".</p>\n\n<h2>Study case now</h2>\n\n<p>Big O notation doesn't question your algorithm, it just assumes that you know what you are doing. It is essentially a tool applicable everywhere, even to algorithm which may be deliberately tricky (like yours).</p>\n\n<p>To solve your problem you used the current date and a future date, so they must be part of the problem somehow; simply put: they are part of the instance of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically the instance is:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;DeltaTime&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Where the <code>&lt;&gt;</code> means any, non pathological, coding of choice.</p>\n\n<p>See below for <strong>very important</strong> clarifications.</p>\n\n<p>So your big O complexity time is just <code>O(2^|&lt;DeltaTime&gt;|)</code>, because you do a number of iteration that depends on the value of current time.\nThere is no point in putting other numeric constants as the asymptotic notation is useful as it eliminates constants (so for example the use of <code>O(10^|&lt;DeltaTime&gt;|*any_time_unit)</code> is pointless). </p>\n\n<h2>Where the tricky part is</h2>\n\n<p>We made one important assumption above: that the model of computation reificates<sup>5</sup> time, and by time I mean the (real?) physical time.\nThere is no such concept in the standard computational model, a TM does not know time, we link time with the number of steps because this is how our reality work<sup>4</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>In your model however time is part of the computation, you may use the terminology of functional people by saying that Main is not pure but the concept is the same.</p>\n\n<p>To understand this one should note that nothing prevent the Framework to using a fake time that run twice, five, ten times faster that physical time. This way your code will run in \"half\", \"one fifth\", \"one tenth\" of the \"time\".</p>\n\n<p>This reflection is important for choosing the encoding of <code>&lt;DeltaTime&gt;</code>, this is essentially a condensed way of writing &lt;(CurrentTime, TimeInFuture)>.\nSince time does not exist at priory, the coding of CurrentTime could very well be the word <em>Now</em> (or any other choice) the day before could be coded as <em>Yesterday</em>, there by breaking the assumption that the length of the coding <strong>increase</strong> as the physical time goes forward (and the one of DeltaTime decreases)</p>\n\n<p>We have to properly model time in our computational model in order to do something useful.</p>\n\n<p>The only safe choice we can do is to encode timestamps with increasing lengths (but still not using unary) as the physical time steps forward. This is the only true property of time we need and the one the encoding needs to catch.\nIs it only with this type of encoding that your algorithm maybe given a time complexity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your confusion, if any, arise from the fact that the word <em>time</em> in the phrases 'What is its <em>time</em> complexity?' and 'How much <em>time</em> will it take?' means to very very different things</strong></p>\n\n<p>Alas the terminology use the same words, but you can try using \"steps complexity\" in your head and re-ask yourself your question, I hope that will help you understand the answer really is ^_^</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> This also explains the need of an asymptotic approach as each instance has  a different, yet not arbitrary, length.<br>\n<sup>2</sup> I hope I'm using the correct English term here.<br>\n<sup>3</sup> Also this is why we often find <code>log(log(n))</code> terms in the math.<br>\n<sup>4</sup> Id est, a step must occupy some finite, but not null, nor not connected, interval of time.<br>\n<sup>5</sup> This means that the computational mode as a knowledge of physical time in it, that is can express it with its terms.

This means I have a very long list of small computations. The vanilla program runs on a specific scene in 67.98 seconds and 13 MB of total memory use and 99.2% productivity.</p>\n\n<p>In my first attempt I used the parallel strategy <code>parBuffer</code> with a buffer size of 50. I chose <code>parBuffer</code> because it walks through the list only as fast as sparks are consumed, and does not force the spine of the list like <code>parList</code>, which would use a lot of memory since the list is very long. With <code>-N2</code>, it ran in a time of 100.46 seconds and 14 MB of total memory use and 97.8% productivity. The spark information is: <code>SPARKS: 480000 (476469 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 161 GC'd, 3370 fizzled)</code></p>\n\n<p>The large proportion of fizzled sparks indicates that the granularity of sparks was too small, so next I tried using the strategy <code>parListChunk</code>, which splits the list into chunks and creates a spark for each chunk. I got the best results with a chunk size of <code>0.25 * imageWidth</code>. The program ran in 93.43 seconds and 236 MB of total memory use and 97.3% productivity. The spark information is: <code>SPARKS: 2400 (2400 converted, 0 overflowed, 0 dud, 0 GC'd, 0 fizzled)</code>. I believe the much greater memory use is because <code>parListChunk</code> forces the spine of the list.</p>\n\n<p>Then I tried to write my own strategy that lazily divided the list into chunks and then passed the chunks to <code>parBuffer</code> and concatenated the results.</p>\n\n<pre><code> concat $ withStrategy (parBuffer 40 rdeepseq) (chunksOf 100 (map colorPixel pixels))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This ran in 95.99 seconds and 22MB of total memory use and 98.8% productivity.

I read that Haskell main thread will use memory from the heap if its stack overflows, so I also tried increasing the default stack size too with <code>+RTS -M1G -K1G</code> but this also had no impact.</p>\n\n<p>Is there anything else I can try? I can post more detailed profiling info for memory usage or eventlog if needed, I did not include it all because it is a lot of information and I did not think all of it was necessary to include.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: I was reading about the <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/parallel/multicore-ghc.pdf\">Haskell RTS multicore support</a>, and it talks about there being a HEC (Haskell Execution Context) for each core.

It could involve introducing additional local variables, having objects with wider than expected scope or even reversing normal loop ordering.

The logic for this has nothing to do with performance, but rather with human readability.  In the <em>vast</em> majority of cases, the readability of your program is more important than its performance.  You should aim to write code which is easier for a human to read, and then only worry about optimization when you are convinced that performance is more important than the maintainability of your code.</p>\n\n<p>Once you do see that performance matters, you should run a profiler on the code to determine which loops are being inefficient, and optimize those individually.  There may indeed be cases where you want to do that optimization (especially if you migrate towards C++, where STL containers get involved), but the cost in terms of readability is great.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, I can think of pathological situations where it could actually slow the code down.  For example, consider the case where the compiler could not prove that <code>bitmap-&gt;width</code> was constant through the process.  By adding the <code>width</code> variable you force the compiler to maintain a local variable in that scope.  If, for some platform specific reason, that extra variable prevented some stack-space optimization, it may have to reorganize how it is emitting bytecodes, and produce something less efficient.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, on Windows x64, one is obliged to call a special API call, <code>__chkstk</code> in the preamble of the function if the function will use more than 1 page of local variables.  This function gives windows a chance to manage the guard pages they use to expand the stack when needed.  If your extra variable pushes the stack usage up from below 1 page to at-or-above 1 page, your function is now obliged to call <code>__chkstk</code> every time it is entered.  If you were to optimize this loop on a slow path, you may actually slow the fast path down more than you saved on the slow path!</p>\n\n<p>Sure, it's a bit pathological, but the point of that example is that you can actually slow the compiler down.  It just shows that you do have to profile your work to determine where the optimizations go.

All the code is perfectly well-formed across all standards&Dagger; with the exception of this line:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char * s = \"My String\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, the string literal has type <code>const char[10]</code> and we're trying to initialize a non-const pointer to it. For all other types other than the <code>char</code> family of string literals, such an initialization was always illegal. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>const int arr[] = {1};\nint *p = arr; // nope!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, in pre-C++11, for string literals, there was an exception in \u00a74.2/2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A string literal (2.13.4) that is not a wide string literal can be converted to an rvalue of type \u201c<strong>pointer to char</strong>\u201d; [...].

This conversion is considered only when there is an explicit appropriate pointer target type, and not when there is a general need to convert from an lvalue to an rvalue. <em>[Note:</em> this conversion is <strong>deprecated</strong>. See Annex D. <em>]</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in C++03, the code is perfectly fine (though deprecated), and has clear, predictable behavior.</p>\n\n<p>In C++11, that block does not exist - there is no such exception for string literals converted to <code>char*</code>, and so the code is just as ill-formed as the <code>int*</code> example I just provided. The compiler is obligated to issue a diagnostic, and ideally in cases such as this that are clear violations of the C++ type system, we would expect a good compiler to not just be conforming in this regard (e.g. by issuing a warning) but to fail outright. </p>\n\n<p>The code should ideally not compile - but does on both gcc and clang (I assume because there's probably lots of code out there that would be broken with little gain, despite this type system hole being deprecated for over a decade). The code is ill-formed, and thus it does not make sense to reason about what the behavior of the code might be. But considering this specific case and the history of it being previously allowed, I do not believe it to be an unreasonable stretch to interpret the resulting code as if it were an implicit <code>const_cast</code>, something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>const int arr[] = {1};\nint *p = const_cast&lt;int*&gt;(arr); // OK, technically\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With that, the rest of the program is perfectly fine, as you never actually touch <code>s</code> again. <em>Reading</em> a created-<code>const</code> object via a non-<code>const</code> pointer is perfectly OK. <em>Writing</em> a created-<code>const</code> object via such a pointer is undefined behavior:</p>\n\n<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; *p; // fine, prints 1\n*p = 5;          // will compile, but undefined behavior, which\n                 // certainly qualifies as \"unpredictable\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As there is no modification via <code>s</code> anywhere in your code, the program is fine in C++03, should fail to compile in C++11 but does anyway - and given that the compilers allow it, there's still no undefined behavior in it&dagger;. With allowances that the compilers are still [incorrectly] interpreting the C++03 rules, I see nothing that would lead to \"unpredictable\" behavior. Write to <code>s</code> though, and all bets are off. In both C++03 and C++11. </p>\n\n<p><hr />\n<sub>&dagger;Though, again, by definition ill-formed code yields no expectation of reasonable behavior</sub><br>\n<sub>&Dagger;Except not, see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/31820997/2069064\">Matt McNabb's answer</a></sub></p>\n", "title": "What makes this usage of pointers unpredictable?", "tags": ["c++", "pointers"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31816473/what-makes-this-usage-of-pointers-unpredictable/31817001#31817001", "question_id": 31816473, "answer_id": 31817001}, {"body": "<p>As others have noted, the code is illegitimate under C++11, although it was valid under earlier versions.  Consequently, a compiler for C++11 is required to issue at least one diagnostic, but behavior of the compiler or the remainder of the build system is unspecified beyond that.

While there have historically been (and may still be) some platforms where a failed compilation can result in legitimate-appearing executable files that crash in arbitrary fashion when loaded (and I've had to work with systems where link errors often had such behavior), I would not say that the consequences of syntax errors are generally unpredictable.  On a good system, an attempted build will generally either produce an executable with a compiler's best effort at code generation, or won't produce an executable at all.  Some systems will leave behind the old executable after a failed build, since in some cases being able to run the last successful build may be useful, but that can also lead to confusion.</p>\n\n<p>My personal preference would be for disk-based systems to to rename the output file, to allow for the rare occasions when that executable would be useful while avoiding the confusion that can result from mistakenly believing one is running new code, and for embedded-programming systems to allow a programmer to specify for each project a program that should be loaded if a valid executable is not available under the normal name [ideally something which which safely indicates the lack of a useable program].  An embedded-systems tool-set would generally have no way of knowing what such a program should do, but in many cases someone writing \"real\" code for a system will have access to some hardware-test code that could easily be adapted to the purpose.

And question from the title has very little to do with concerns expressed by the OP in the comments afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Although I realize that for the OP it is their particular case that matters, for the readers coming from Google, it is important to answer to the more general question, that can be phrased as \"is concatenation as safe as prepared statements if I made sure that every literal I am concatenating is safe?\". So, I would like to concentrate on this latter one. And the answer is</p>\n\n<h1>Definitely NO.</h1>\n\n<p>The explanation is not that direct as most readers would like, but I'll try my best. </p>\n\n<p>I have been pondering on the matter for a while, resulting in the <a href=\"http://phpdelusions.net/sql_injection\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> (though based on the PHP environment) where I tried to sum everything up. It occurred to me that the question of protection from SQL injection is often eludes toward some related but narrower topics, like string escaping, type casting and such. Although some of the measures can be considered safe when taken by themselves, there is no system, nor a simple rule to follow. Which makes it very slippery ground, putting too much on the developer's attention and experience. </p>\n\n<p>The question of SQL injection cannot be simplified to a matter of some particular syntax issue. It is wider than average developer used to think. It's a <em>methodological</em> question as well. It is not only \"Which particular formatting we have to apply\", but \"<em>How</em> it have to be done\" as well. </p>\n\n<p>(From this point of view, an article from Jon Skeet cited in the other answer is doing rather bad than good, as it is again nitpicking on some edge case, concentrating on a particular syntax issue and failing to address the problem at whole.)</p>\n\n<p>When you're trying to address the question of protection not as whole but as a set of different syntax issues, you're facing multitude of problems.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the list of possible formatting choices is really huge. Means one can easily overlook some. Or confuse them (by using <em>string</em> escaping for <em>identifier</em> for example).</li>\n<li>Concatenation means that all protection measures have to be done by the programmer, not program. This issue alone leads to several consequences:\n\n<ul>\n<li>such a formatting is manual. Manual means <em>extremely</em> error prone. One could simply forget to apply.</li>\n<li>moreover, there is a temptation to move formatting procedures into some centralized function, messing things even more, and spoiling data that is not going to database. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>when more than one developers involved, problems multiply by a factor of ten. </li>\n<li>when concatenation is used, one cannot tell a potentially dangerous query at glance: they <em>all</em> potentially dangerous!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unlike that mess, prepared statements are indeed The Holy Grail:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>it can be expressed in the form of one simple rule that is easy to follow.</li>\n<li>it is essentially undetacheable measure, means the developer cannot interfere, and, willingly or unwillingly, spoil the process.</li>\n<li>protection from injection is really only a <em>side effect</em> of the prepared statements, which real purpose is to produce syntactically correct statement. And a syntactically correct statement is 100% injection proof. Yet we need our syntax to be correct despite of any injection possibility.</li>\n<li>if used all the way around, it protects the application regardless of the developer's experience. Say, there is a thing called <a href=\"http://download.oracle.com/oll/tutorials/SQLInjection/html/lesson1/les01_tm_attacks2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">second order injection</a>. And a very strong delusion that reads \"in order to protect,  <a href=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Defense_Option_3:_Escaping_All_User_Supplied_Input\" rel=\"nofollow\">Escape All User Supplied Input</a>\". Combined together, they lead to injection, if a developer takes the liberty to decide, what needs to be protected and what not.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Thinking further, I discovered that current set of placeholders is not enough for the real life needs and have to be extended, both for the complex data structures, like arrays, and even SQL keywords or identifiers, which have to be sometimes added to the query dynamically too, but a developer is left unarmed for such a case, and forced to fall back to string concatenation but that's a matter of another question).</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, this question's controversy is provoked by the very controversial nature of Stack Overflow. The site's idea is to make use of <strong>particular questions from users who ask directly</strong> to achieve the goal of having a database of <strong>general purpose answers suitable for users who come from search</strong>. The idea is not bad <em>per se</em>, but it fails in a situation like this: when a user asks a <em>very narrow question</em>, particularly to get an argument in a dispute with a colleague (or to decide if it worth to refactor the code).

From a database perspective, a parametrized query is one query in the SQL buffer (to use Oracle's terminology although I imagine all databases have a similar concept internally).  So, the database can hold a certain amount of queries in memory, prepared and ready to execute.  These queries do not need to be parsed and will be quicker.  Frequently run queries will usually be in the buffer and will not need parsing every time they are used.</p>\n\n<p>UNLESS</p>\n\n<p>Somebody doesn't use parametrized queries.  In this case, the buffer gets continually flushed through by a stream of nearly identical queries each of which needs to be parsed and run by the database engine and performance suffers all-round as even frequently run queries end up being re-parsed many times a day.  I have tuned databases for a living and this has been one of the biggest sources of low-hanging fruit.</p>\n\n<p>NOW</p>\n\n<p>To answer your question, IF your query has a small number of distinct numeric values, you will probably not be causing issues and may in fact improve performance infinitesimally.

FalcorJS on the other hand tends to act separately from the widget system which means both that it may be easier to integrate into a non-React/Relay client and that it will do less for you automatically in terms of matching widget data dependencies with widgets.</li>\n<li>The flip side of FalcorJS being flexible in client side integrations is that it can be very opinionated about how the server needs to act. FalcorJS actually does have a straight up \"Call this Query over HTTP\" capability - although Jafar Husain doesn't seem to talk about it very much - and once you include those, the way the client libraries react to server information is quite similar except that GraphQL/Relay adds a layer of configuration.  In FalcorJS, if you are returning a value for movie, your return value better say 'movie', whereas in GraphQL, you can describe that even though the query returns 'film', you should put that in the client side datastore as 'movie'. - this is part of the power vs complexity tradeoff that Gajus mentioned.</li>\n<li>On a practical basis, GraphQL and Relay seems to be more developed.  Jafar Husain has mentioned that the next version of the Netflix frontend will be running at least in part on FalcorJS whereas the Facebook team has mentioned that they've been using some version of the GraphQL/Relay stack in production for over 3 years.</li>\n<li>The open source developer community around GraphQL and Relay seems to be thriving. There are a large number of well-attended supporting projects around GraphQL and Relay whereas I have personally found very few around FalcorJS.  Also the base github repository for Relay (<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/relay/pulse\">https://github.com/facebook/relay/pulse</a>) is significantly more active than the github repository for FalcorJS (<a href=\"https://github.com/netflix/falcor/pulse\">https://github.com/netflix/falcor/pulse</a>).  When I first pulled the Facebook repo, the examples were broken. I opened a github issue and it was fixed within hours.  On the other hand, the github issue I opened on FalcorJS has had no official response in two weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "What is the difference between Falcor and GraphQL?", "tags": ["graphql", "relayjs", "falcor", "facebook-relay"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32057785/what-is-the-difference-between-falcor-and-graphql/32702514#32702514", "question_id": 32057785, "answer_id": 32702514}, {"body": "<p>UPDATE: I've found the very useful comment under my post that I want to share with you as a complementary thing to the main content:\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mhmub.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/mhmub.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Regarding lack of examples, you can find the awesome-falcorjs repo userful, there are different examples of a Falcor's CRUD usage:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/przeor/awesome-falcorjs\">https://github.com/przeor/awesome-falcorjs</a></p>\n\n<p>ORGINAL POST BELOW:</p>\n\n<p>FalcorJS (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/falcorjs/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/falcorjs/</a>) is much more simpler to be efficient in comparison to Relay/GraphQL.</p>\n\n<p>The learning curve for GraphQL+Relay is HUGE:\n<a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tnk9a.png\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tnk9a.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In my short summary: Go for Falcor.

Falcor has small API and is very easy to grasp to any front-end developer who is familiar with JSON.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an AGILE project with limited resources -> then go for FalcorJS!</p>\n\n<p>MY SUBJECTIVE opinion: FalcorJS is 500%+ easier to be efficient in full-stack javascript.</p>\n\n<p>I have also published some FalcorJS starter kits on my project (+more full-stack falcor's example projects): <a href=\"https://www.github.com/przeor\">https://www.github.com/przeor</a></p>\n\n<p>To be more in technical details:</p>\n\n<p>1) When you are using Falcor, then you can use both on front-end and backend:</p>\n\n<p>import falcor from 'falcor';</p>\n\n<p>and then build your model based upon.</p>\n\n<p>... you need also two libraries which are simple to use on backend:\na) falcor-express - you use it once (ex. <strong>app.use('/model.json', FalcorServer.dataSourceRoute(() => new NamesRouter()))</strong>).

question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Falcor returns Observables, GraphQL just values.</strong> For how Netflix wanted to use Falcor, this makes a lot of sense for them. They make multiple requests and present data as it's ready, but it also means that the client developer has to work with the Observables directly. GraphQL is a request/response model, and returns back JSON, which is trivially easy to then use. Relay adds back in some of the dynamicism that Falcor presents while maintaining only using plain values.</li>\n  <li><strong>Type system.</strong> GraphQL is defined in terms of a type system, and that's allowed us to built lots of interesting tools like GraphiQL, code generators, error detection, etc. Falcor is much more dynamic, which is valuable in its own right but limits the ability to do this kind of thing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Network usage.</strong> GraphQL was originally designed for operating Facebook's news feed on low end devices on even lower end networks, so it goes to great lengths to allow you to declare everything you need in a single network request in order to minimize latency. Falcor, on the other hand, often performs multiple round trips to collect additional data. This is really just a tradeoff between the simplicity of the system and the control of the network. For Netflix, they also deal with very low end devices (e.g. Roku stick) but the assumption is the network will be good enough to stream video.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Edit: Falcor can indeed <a href=\"https://netflix.github.io/falcor/starter/how-does-falcor-work.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">batch requests</a>, making the comment about the network usage inaccurate.

For an object\n  under construction or destruction, see 12.7. Otherwise, such a glvalue\n  refers to allocated storage (3.7.4.2), and using the properties of the\n  glvalue that do not depend on its value is well-defined. The program\n  has undefined behavior if:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (4.1) is applied to such a glvalue,</p></li>\n  <li><p>the glvalue is used to access a non-static data member or call a non-static member function of the\n  object, or</p></li>\n  <li><p>the glvalue is bound to a reference to a virtual base class (8.5.3), or</p></li>\n  <li><p>the glvalue is used as the operand of a dynamic_cast (5.2.7) or as the operand of typeid.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We are not doing anything with <code>foo</code> that falls under undefined behavior as defined by the bullets above. </p>\n\n<p>If we try this with clang we see an ominous warning (<em><a href=\"http://melpon.org/wandbox/permlink/r91TJdb8tVqSnuPG\" rel=\"nofollow\">see it live</a></em>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>warning: variable 'foo' is uninitialized when used within its own initialization [-Wuninitialized]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is a valid warning since <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/23415661/1708801\">producing and indeterminate value from an uninitialized automatic variable is undefined behavior</a> but in this case you are just binding a reference and taking the address of the variable within the constructor which does not produce an indeterminate value and is valid. On the other hand the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/14935722/1708801\">following self-initialization example from the draft C++11 standard</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int x = x ;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>does invoke undefined behavior.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/cwg_active.html#453\" rel=\"nofollow\">Active issue 453: References may only bind to \u201cvalid\u201d objects </a> also seems relevant but is still open.

However, curiously, it also adds this note:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/* in any case, allow '0' as a literal */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>with a special <code>nonzero</code> flag that only throws a <code>SyntaxError</code> if the following sequence of digits contains a nonzero digit.</p>\n\n<p>This is odd because <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3127/\">PEP 3127</a> does not allow this case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This PEP proposes that the ability to specify an octal number by using a leading zero will be removed from the language in Python 3.0 (and the Python 3.0 preview mode of 2.6), and that <strong>a SyntaxError will be raised whenever a leading \"0\" is immediately followed by another digit</strong>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(emphasis mine)</p>\n\n<p>So, the fact that multiple zeros are allowed is <em>technically</em> violating the PEP, and was basically implemented as a special case by Georg Brandl.

On my tests, I accidentally typed the following on my optimal \u03bb-calculator:</p>\n\n<pre><code>10 ^ 10 % 13\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It was supposed to be multiplication, not exponentiation.

It instantly answered me <code>20^20%13 == 3</code>, <code>50^50%13 == 4</code>, <code>60^60%3 == 0</code>. I had to use <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/quenell/s2003/ma139/js/powermod.html\">external tools</a> to verify those results, since <s>Haskell itself wasn't able to compute it (due to integer overflow)</s> (it is if you use Integers not Ints, of course!).

This is a general feature, that is completely independent from the arithmetic formulas you could use in this particular example.</p>\n\n<p>Sharing means having a representation of your lambda-term in which one \"node\" can describe several similar parts of the actual lambda-term you represent. For instance, you can represent the term </p>\n\n<pre><code>\\x. x ((\\y.y)a) ((\\y.y)a)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>using a (directed acyclic) graph in which there is only one occurrence of the subgraph representing <code>(\\y.y)a</code>, and two edges targeting that subgraph. In Haskell terms, you have one thunk, that you evaluate only once, and two pointers to this thunk.</p>\n\n<p>Haskell-style memoization implements sharing of complete subterms. This level of sharing can be represented by directed acyclic graphs. Optimal sharing does not have this restriction: it can also share \"partial\" subterms, which may imply cycles in the graph representation.</p>\n\n<p>To see the difference between these two levels of sharing, consider the term</p>\n\n<pre><code>\\x. (\\z.z) ((\\z.z) x)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If your sharing is restricted to complete subterms as it is the case in Haskell, you may have only one occurrence of <code>\\z.z</code>, but the two beta-redexes here will be distinct: one is <code>(\\z.z) x</code> and the other one is <code>(\\z.z) ((\\z.z) x)</code>, and since they are not equal terms they cannot be shared.\nIf the sharing of partial subterms is allowed, then it becomes possible to share the partial term <code>(\\z.z) []</code> (that is not just the function <code>\\z.z</code>, but \"the function <code>\\z.z</code> applied to <em>something</em>), which evaluates in one step to just <em>something</em>, whatever this argument is. Hence you can have a graph in which only one node represents the two applications of <code>\\z.z</code> to two distinct arguments, and in which these two applications can be reduced in just one step. Remark that there is a cycle on this node, since the argument of the \"first occurrence\" is precisely the \"second occurrence\".\nFinally, with optimal sharing you can go from (a graph representing) <code>\\x. (\\z.z) ((\\z.z) x))</code> to (a graph representing) the result <code>\\x.x</code> in just one step of beta-reduction (plus some bookkeeping). This is basically what happens in your optimal evaluator (and the graph representation is also what prevents space explosion).</p>\n\n<p>For slightly extended explanations, you can look at the paper <a href=\"http://www.lri.fr/~blsk/Docs/Balabonski-WeakOptimality-ICFP13.pdf\">Weak Optimality, and the Meaning of Sharing</a> (what you are interested in is the introduction and the section 4.1, and maybe some of the bibliographic pointers at the end).</p>\n\n<p>Coming back at your example, the coding of arithmetic functions working on Church integers is one of the \"well-known\" mines of examples where optimal evaluators can perform better than mainstream languages (in this sentence, well-known actually means that a handful of specialists are aware of these examples).\nFor more such examples, take a look at the paper <a href=\"http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/safebrackets.ps.gz\">Safe Operators: Brackets Closed Forever</a> by Asperti and Chroboczek (and by the way, you will find here interesting lambda-terms that are not EAL-typeable; so I\u2019m encouraging you to take a look at oracles, starting with this Asperti/Chroboczek paper).</p>\n\n<p>As you said yourself, this kind of encoding is utterly unpractical, but they still represent a nice way of understanding what is going on. And let me conclude with a challenge for further investigation: will you be able to find an example on which optimal evaluation on these supposedly bad encodings is actually on par with traditional evaluation on a reasonable data representation? (as far as I know this is a real open question).</p>\n\n<p>Best regards, and let me know of what happens next.</p>\n\n<p>Thibaut Balabonski.</p>\n", "title": "Why are \u03bb-calculus optimal evaluators able to compute big modular exponentiations without formulas?", "tags": ["algorithm", "haskell", "functional-programming", "lambda-calculus", "modular-arithmetic"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31707614/why-are-%ce%bb-calculus-optimal-evaluators-able-to-compute-big-modular-exponentiation/31724886#31724886", "question_id": 31707614, "answer_id": 31724886}], "creation_date": 1438192079, "score": 98, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31707614/why-are-%ce%bb-calculus-optimal-evaluators-able-to-compute-big-modular-exponentiation", "question_id": 31707614}, {"body": "<p>I\u2019m building an image-intensive social app where images are sent from the server to the device.

But the downside, <em>is that this API requires an <strong>existing</strong> bitmap in order to work</em>. Meaning the image would have to be loaded, decoded, and a bitmap created, before being able to create a new, smaller version. This is ideal in terms of getting your exact dimensions, but horrible in terms of additional memory overhead. As such, this is kind-of a deal breaker for most app developers who tend to be memory conscious</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/BitmapFactory.Options.html#inSampleSize\">inSampleSize flag</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><code>BitmapFactory.Options</code> has a property noted as <code>inSampleSize</code> that will resize your image while decoding it, to avoid the need to decode to a temporary bitmap. This integer value used here will load an image at a 1/x reduced size. For example, setting <code>inSampleSize</code> to 2 returns an image that\u2019s  half the size, and Setting it to 4 returns an image that\u2019s 1/ 4th the size. Basically image sizes will always be some power-of-two smaller than your source size.</p>\n\n<p>From a memory perspective, using <code>inSampleSize</code> is a really fast operation. Effectively, it will only decode every Xth pixel of your image into your resulting bitmap. There\u2019s two main issues with <code>inSampleSize</code> though:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>It doesn\u2019t give you exact resolutions</strong>. It only decreases the size of your bitmap by some power of 2.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>It doesn\u2019t produce the best quality resize</strong>. Most resizing filters produce good looking images by reading blocks of pixels, and then weighting them to produce the resized pixel in question. <code>inSampleSize</code> avoids all this by just reading every few pixels. The result is quite performant, and low memory, but quality suffers.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you're only dealing with shrinking your image by some pow2 size, and filtering isn't an issue, then you can't find a more memory efficient (or performance efficient) method than <code>inSampleSize</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/BitmapFactory.Options.html#inScaled\">inScaled, inDensity, inTargetDensity flags</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>If you need to scale an image to a dimension that\u2019s not equal to a power of two,  then you\u2019ll need the <code>inScaled</code>, <code>inDensity</code> and <code>inTargetDensity</code> flags of <code>BitmapOptions</code>. When <code>inScaled</code> flag has been set, the system will derive the scaling value to apply to your bitmap by dividing the <code>inTargetDensity</code> by the <code>inDensity</code> values.</p>\n\n<pre><code>mBitmapOptions.inScaled = true;\nmBitmapOptions.inDensity = srcWidth;\nmBitmapOptions.inTargetDensity =  dstWidth;\n\n// will load &amp; resize the image to be 1/inSampleSize dimensions\nmCurrentBitmap = BitmapFactory.decodeResources(getResources(), \n      mImageIDs, mBitmapOptions);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using this method will re-size your image, and also apply a \u2018resizing filter\u2019 to it, that is, the end result will look better because some additional math has been taken into account during the resizing step. But be warned: <strong>that extra filter step, takes extra processing time</strong>, and can quickly add up for big images, resulting in slow resizes, and extra memory allocations for the filter itself.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s generally not a good idea to apply this technique to an image that\u2019s significantly larger than your desired size, due to the extra filtering overhead.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Magic Combination</strong> </p>\n\n<p>From a memory and performance perspective, you can combine these options for the best results.

I\nthought, I'd post some of the solutions that might prove to be useful for those who are still having trouble with installing Visual Studios 2015 Community Edition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 1: Minimal Installation</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Try installing with minimal extra features. Run the Visual Studios 2015 installation, then click \"Custom\" and on the following screen, uncheck everything and proceed with the installation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 2: Delete installation cache</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perhaps the installation failed due to corrupt files in the cache. When installation fails, remove all Visual Studio cache related items and do a full re-installation. To do this, run command prompt (<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>) and type: \"<strong>cd /programdata/package cache/</strong>\" then press enter. Then type \"<strong>del /f /s *.msi /f /s *.cab</strong>\" then press enter. \n  Now run the Visual Studios 2015 installation again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 3: Delete temporary file data stored on your computer</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Open up File Explorer and go to \"<strong>C:\\Users\\[Your User Account Name]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft</strong>\". Then delete the following folders: VSCommon, VisualStudio, Blend, VsGraphics, ApplicationInsights, vshub, Team Foundation, Web Platform Installer and MsBuild. After this, run the Visual Studios 2015 Installer again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 4: Enable all four evaluations of Symbolic links</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First, check to see if all four evaluations are enabled. Open up command prompt (<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>) and type \"<strong>fsutil behavior query SymlinkEvaluation</strong>\". All 4 evaluations should be enabled. If they aren't then type \"<strong>fsutil behavior set SymlinkEvaluation L2L:1 R2R:1 L2R:1 R2L:1</strong>\". Once those 4 evaluations are set, clear up temporary files and clear installation cache (see Solution 2 and Solution 3) then run the Visual Studios 2015 installation again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 5: Repair the Redistributables</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perhaps, the problem is that your VC-redistributables are faulty and are in need of repair. To do so, run \"Add/Remove programs\" and look for all the x86 and x64 versions of <em>Microsoft Visual C++ [Year] Redistributable (Version)</em>. Then press Change for each of them and when the uninstallation screen pops up, press Repair. I did it for all the versions I had previously installed: 2012, 2013 and 2015. Therefore, I repaired 6 of them: 2012: x86 and x64, 2013: x86 and x64, 2015: x86 and x64. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 6: Check to see if x86 and x64 sizes are the same</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As mentioned by others in this discussion, do a search for vcruntime140.dll and see if the x86 and x64 versions. They should <em>NOT</em> have the same size. If they do, see solution 5 or you can manually delete them (** Be cautious when deleting files from the Windows folder!) and re-install them (from here: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=48145\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=48145</a>). <br> Also do the same check for msvcp140.dll. I personally did a search for these files in \"<strong>C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64</strong> and <strong>C:\\Windows\\System32</strong>\" and compared the files from the two folders. Moreover I also checked for differences of vcruntime140.dll and msvcp140.dll in \"<strong>C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0</strong>\" and \"<strong>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 7: Temporarily disable all Anti-Virus Protection and Firewalls</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For me, it turned out that the problem stemmed from having <em>ByteFence Anti-Malware</em> and <em>Norton Security with Backup</em> protection. I disabled <strong>real-time protection</strong> from <em>ByteFence Anti-Malware</em> and I disabled <strong>Auto-Protect</strong> and <strong>Smart Firewall</strong> from <em>Norton Security with Backup</em>. Before I ran the installation again, I repeated Solution 2 and Solution 3 (scroll up). And Voila, installation was successful. But how did I find out that the Anti-Virus Program was the culprit? Read Solution 8. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 8: Carefully monitor Visual Studios Installation Process for Intrusions</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I resorted to this solution in order to find out the problem. After reading Ezh's article, I decided to download <strong>Process Monitor v3.2</strong> and <strong>Process Explorer v16.1</strong>. I was carefully monitoring 3 programs side-by-side: Process Monitor, Process Explorer and the Visual Studios 2015 Installer, and I watched very closely all the processes that the installer was invoking. Then I noticed that when VSIXInstaller.exe process came on and attempted to install something from a remote server, it kept failing over and over again because my Anti-Virus Program would suddenly appear on screen (as a process) and decide to hog/block some important DLL files that VSIX installation needed. Temporarily disabling the anti-virus program solved my issue!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Solution 9: Complete Windows format and re-installation</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If all else fails, and you are really desperate to get Visual Studios 2015 working, I suggest a complete Windows re-installation. At this point, the problem is most likely some type of interference/intrusion with a program which you do not know of.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "Multiple Errors Installing Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition", "tags": ["visual-studio", "visual-studio-2015"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33855177/multiple-errors-installing-visual-studio-2015-community-edition/35089747#35089747", "question_id": 33855177, "answer_id": 35089747}, {"body": "<p>As described from other answers, but with steps:</p>\n\n<p>1- go to control panel -> uninstall programs -> uninstall all Microsoft C++ ((year)) Redistributable</p>\n\n<p>2- delete those files if they still exist manually:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>c:\\windows\\System32\\vcruntime140.dll</li>\n<li>c:\\windows\\SysWOW64\\vcruntime140.dll</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>3- download and install:\n<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145</a></p>\n\n<p>after that rerun the installation of Visual Studio, and hope that error won't show again.</p>\n", "title": "Multiple Errors Installing Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition", "tags": ["visual-studio", "visual-studio-2015"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33855177/multiple-errors-installing-visual-studio-2015-community-edition/35128133#35128133", "question_id": 33855177, "answer_id": 35128133}, {"body": "<p>Like the rest of you, I've spent days trying to figure this out.

Previously I used a static method which utilized reflection for the same purpose, which however does have a runtime performance impact.

After obfuscation the embedded string may no longer match the name of the element. Mechanisms that rely on this text will break. Examples for that, including but not limited to are: Reflection, NotifyPropertyChanged ...</p>\n\n<p>Determining the name during runtime costs some performance, but is safe for obfuscation.
