My feeling is that Node.js is especially suited for applications where you'd like to maintain a persistent connection from the browser back to the server. Using a technique known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling\">\"long-polling\"</a>, you can write an application that sends updates to the user in real time. Doing long polling on many of the web's giants, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails\">Ruby on Rails</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_%28web_framework%29\">Django</a>, would create immense load on the server, because each active client eats up one server process. This situation amounts to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_%28networking%29\">tarpit</a> attack. When you use something like Node.js, the server has no need of maintaining separate threads for each open connection.  </p>\n\n<p>This means you can create a <a href=\"https://github.com/rivalslayer/node_chat\">browser-based chat application</a> in Node.js that takes almost no system resources to serve a great many clients. Any time you want to do this sort of long-polling, Node.js is a great option.  </p>\n\n<p>It's worth mentioning that Ruby and Python both have tools to do this sort of thing (<a href=\"http://rubyeventmachine.com/\">eventmachine</a> and <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/\">twisted</a>, respectively), but that Node.js does it exceptionally well, and from the ground up. JavaScript is exceptionally well situated to a callback-based concurrency model, and it excels here. Also, being able to serialize and deserialize with JSON native to both the client and the server is pretty nifty. </p>\n\n<p>I look forward to reading other answers here, this is a fantastic question. </p>\n\n<p>It's worth pointing out that Node.js is also great for situations in which you'll be reusing a lot of code across the client/server gap. The <a href=\"http://meteor.com\">Meteor framework</a> makes this really easy, and a lot of folks are suggesting this might be the future of web development. I can say from experience that it's a whole lot of fun to write code in Meteor, and a big part of this is spending less time thinking about how you're going to restructure your data, so the code that runs in the browser can easily manipulate it and pass it back. </p>\n\n<p>Here's an article on Pyramid and long-polling, which turns out to be very easy to set up with a little help from gevent: <a href=\"http://michael.merickel.org/2011/6/21/tictactoe-and-long-polling-with-pyramid/\"><em>TicTacToe and Long Polling with Pyramid</em></a>.</p>\n", "title": "How to decide when to use Node.js?", "answer_id": 5062670, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5062614/how-to-decide-when-to-use-node-js/5062670#5062670", "tags": ["javascript", "design", "web-applications", "node.js"]}, {"body": "<p>I believe Node.js is best suited for real-time applications: online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, or anything where what one user (or robot?  or sensor?) does with the application needs to be seen by other users immediately, without a page refresh.</p>\n\n<p>I should also mention that Socket.IO in combination with Node.js will reduce your real-time latency even further than what is possible with long polling.  Socket.IO will fall back to long polling as a worst case scenario, and instead use web sockets or even Flash if they are available.</p>\n\n<p>But I should also mention that just about any situation where the code might block due to threads can be better addressed with Node.js.  Or any situation where you need the application to be event-driven.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Ryan Dahl said in a talk that I once attended that the Node.js benchmarks closely rival Nginx for regular old HTTP requests.

From last 2 years I am working on JavaScript and developing web front end and I am enjoying it. Back end guys provide\u2019s us some API\u2019s written in Java,python (we don\u2019t care) and we simply write a AJAX call, get our data and guess what ! we are done. But in real it is not that easy, If data we are getting is not correct or there is some server error then we stuck and we have to contact our back end guys over the mail or chat(sometimes on whatsApp too :).) This is not cool. What if we wrote our API\u2019s in JavaScript and call those API\u2019s from our front end ? Yes that\u2019s pretty cool because if we face any problem in API we can look into it. Guess what ! you can do this now , How ? \u2013 Node is there for you.</p>\n\n<p>Ok agreed that you can write your API in JavaScript but what if I am ok with above problem. Do you have any other reason to use node for rest API ?</p>\n\n<p>so here is the magic begins. Yes I do have other reasons to use node for our API\u2019s.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s go back to our traditional rest API system which is based on either blocking operation or threading. Suppose two concurrent request occurs( r1 and r2) , each of them require database operation. So In traditional system what will happens :</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Waiting Way :</strong> Our server starts serving <code>r1</code> request and waits for query response. after completion of <code>r1</code> , server starts to serve <code>r2</code> and does it in same way. So waiting is not a good idea because we don\u2019t have that much time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Threading Way :</strong> Our server will creates two threads for both requests <code>r1</code> and <code>r2</code> and serve their purpose after querying database so cool its fast.But it is memory consuming because you can see we started two threads also problem increases when both request is querying same data then you have to deal with deadlock kind of issues . So its better than waiting way but still issues are there.</p>\n\n<p>Now here is , how node will do it:</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Nodeway :</strong> When same concurrent request comes in node then it will register an event with its callback and move ahead it will not wait for query response for a particular request.So when <code>r1</code> request comes then node\u2019s event loop (yes there is an event loop in node which serves this purpose.) register an event with its callback function and move ahead for serving <code>r2</code> request and similarly register its event with its callback. Whenever any query finishes it triggers its corresponding event and execute its callback  to completion without being interrupted.</p>\n\n<p>So no waiting, no threading , no memory consumption \u2013 yes this is nodeway for serving rest API.</p>\n", "title": "How to decide when to use Node.js?", "answer_id": 27992032, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5062614/how-to-decide-when-to-use-node-js/27992032#27992032", "tags": ["javascript", "design", "web-applications", "node.js"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>Donning asbestos longjohns...</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yesterday my title with Packt Publications, <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1783558555\">Reactive Programming with JavaScript</a>. It isn't really a Node.js-centric title; early chapters are intended to cover theory, and later code-heavy chapters cover practice. Because I didn't really think it would be appropriate to fail to give readers a webserver, Node.js seemed <strong><em>by far</em></strong> the obvious choice. The case was closed before it was even opened.</p>\n\n<p>I could have given a very rosy view of my experience with Node.js. Instead I was honest about good points and bad points I encountered.</p>\n\n<p>Let me include a few quotes that are relevant here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Warning: Node.js and its ecosystem are <em>hot</em>--hot enough to burn you badly!</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>When I was a teacher\u2019s assistant in math, one of the non-obvious suggestions I was told was not to tell a student that something was \u201ceasy.\u201d The reason was somewhat obvious in retrospect: if you tell people something is easy, someone who doesn\u2019t see a solution may end up feeling (even more) stupid, because not only do they not get how to solve the problem, but the problem they are too stupid to understand is an easy one!</p>\n  \n  <p>There are gotchas that don\u2019t just annoy people coming from Python / Django, which immediately reloads the source if you change anything. With Node.js, the default behavior is that if you make one change, the old version continues to be active until the end of time or until you manually stop and restart the server. This inappropriate behavior doesn\u2019t just annoy Pythonistas; it also irritates native Node.js users who provide various workarounds. The StackOverflow question \u201cAuto-reload of files in Node.js\u201d has, at the time of this writing, over 200 upvotes and 19 answers; an edit directs the user to a nanny script, node-supervisor, with homepage at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/reactjs-node-supervisor\">http://tinyurl.com/reactjs-node-supervisor</a>. This problem affords new users with great opportunity to feel stupid because they thought they had fixed the problem, but the old, buggy behavior is completely unchanged. And it is easy to forget to bounce the server; I have done so multiple times. And the message I would like to give is, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not stupid because this behavior of Node.js bit your back; it\u2019s just that the designers of Node.js saw no reason to provide appropriate behavior here. Do try to cope with it, perhaps taking a little help from node-supervisor or another solution, but please don\u2019t walk away feeling that you\u2019re stupid. You\u2019re not the one with the problem; the problem is in Node.js\u2019s default behavior.\u201d</p>\n  \n  <p>This section, after some debate, was left in, precisely because I don't want to give an impression of \u201cIt\u2019s easy.\u201d I cut my hands repeatedly while getting things to work, and I don\u2019t want to smooth over difficulties and set you up to believe that getting Node.js and its ecosystem to function well is a straightforward matter and if it\u2019s not straightforward for you too, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. If you don\u2019t run into obnoxious difficulties using Node.js, that\u2019s wonderful. If you do, I would hope that you don\u2019t walk away feeling, \u201cI\u2019m stupid\u2014there must be something wrong with me.\u201d You\u2019re not stupid if you experience nasty surprises dealing with Node.js. It\u2019s not you! It\u2019s Node.js and its ecosystem!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Appendix, which I did not really want after the rising crescendo in the last chapters and the conclusion, talks about what I was able to find in the ecosystem, and provided a workaround for moronic literalism:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another database that seemed like a perfect fit, and may yet be redeemable, is a server-side implementation of the HTML5 key-value store. This approach has the cardinal advantage of an API that most good front-end developers understand well enough. For that matter, it\u2019s also an API that most not-so-good front-end developers understand well enough. But with the node-localstorage package, while dictionary-syntax access is not offered (you want to use localStorage.setItem(key, value) or localStorage.getItem(key), not localStorage[key]), the full localStorage semantics are implemented, including a default 5MB quota\u2014<em>WHY?</em> Do server-side JavaScript developers need to be protected from themselves?</p>\n  \n  <p>For client-side database capabilities, a 5MB quota per website is really a generous and useful amount of breathing room to let developers work with it. You could set a much lower quota and still offer developers an immeasurable improvement over limping along with cookie management. A 5MB limit doesn\u2019t lend itself very quickly to Big Data client-side processing, but there is a really quite generous allowance that resourceful developers can use to do a lot. But on the other hand, 5MB is not a particularly large portion of most disks purchased any time recently, meaning that if you and a website disagree about what is reasonable use of disk space, or some site is simply hoggish, it does not really cost you much and you are in no danger of a swamped hard drive unless your hard drive was already too full. Maybe we would be better off if the balance were a little less or a little more, but overall it\u2019s a decent solution to address the intrinsic tension for a client-side context.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, it might gently be pointed out that when you are the one writing code for your server, you don\u2019t need any additional protection from making your database more than a tolerable 5MB in size. Most developers will neither need nor want tools acting as a nanny and protecting them from storing more than 5MB of server-side data. And the 5MB quota that is a golden balancing act on the client-side is rather a bit silly on a Node.js server. (And, for a database for multiple users such as is covered in this Appendix, it might be pointed out, slightly painfully, that that\u2019s not 5MB per user account unless you create a separate database on disk for each user account; that\u2019s 5MB shared between all user accounts together. That could get <em>painful</em> if you go viral!) The documentation states that the quota is customizable, but an email a week ago to the developer asking how to change the quota is unanswered, as was the StackOverflow question asking the same. The only answer I have been able to find is in the Github CoffeeScript source, where it is listed as an optional second integer argument to a constructor. So that\u2019s easy enough, and you could specify a quota equal to a disk or partition size. But besides porting a feature that does not make sense, the tool\u2019s author has failed completely to follow a very standard convention of interpreting 0 as meaning \u201cunlimited\u201d for a variable or function where an integer is to specify a maximum limit for some resource use. The best thing to do with this misfeature is probably to specify that the quota is Infinity:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre><code>if (typeof localStorage === 'undefined' || localStorage === null)\n  {      \n  var LocalStorage = require('node-localstorage').LocalStorage;\n  localStorage = new LocalStorage(__dirname + '/localStorage',\n    Infinity);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Swapping two comments in order:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People needlessly shot themselves in the foot constantly using JavaScript as a whole, and part of JavaScript being made respectable language was a Douglas Crockford saying in essence, \u201cJavaScript as a language has some really good parts and some really bad parts.

GC will invoke the <code>finalize</code> method, but there are JDBC drivers that do not implement the <code>finalize</code>, at least not in the same way that <code>Connection.close</code> is implemented. The resulting behavior is that while memory will be reclaimed due to unreachable objects being collected, resources (including memory) associated with the <code>Connection</code> object might simply not be reclaimed.</p>\n\n<p>In such an event where the <code>Connection</code>'s <code>finalize</code> method does not clean up everything, one might actually find that the physical connection to the database server will last several garbage collection cycles, until the database server eventually figures out that the connection is not alive (if it does), and should be closed.</p>\n\n<p>Even if the JDBC driver were to implement <code>finalize</code>, it is possible for exceptions to be thrown during finalization.

Object resurrection is often done intentionally by creating a strong reference to the object from being finalized, from another object.

Apparently, the Classloader that loaded the singleton class will retain a reference to the class, and hence the singleton instance will never be collected.

What shall be understood is that this is not a Java corner case, or a problem with the garbage collector. It is a design problem.

Java does automatic memory management and will free resources that are not needed for you. You can't stop this from happening. It will ALWAYS be able to release the resources. In programs with manual memory management, this is different. You cann get some memory in C using malloc(). To free the memory, you need the pointer that malloc returned and call free() on it. But if you don't have the pointer anymore (overwritten, or lifetime exceeded), then you are unfortunately incapable of freeing this memory and thus you have a memory leak.</p>\n\n<p>All the other answers so far are in my definition not really memory leaks. They all aim at filling the memory with pointless stuff real fast.

If you call this library, your java process will leak memory. Or, you can have bugs in the JVM, so that the JVM looses memory. There are probably bugs in the JVM, there may even be some known ones since garbage collection is not that trivial, but then it's still a bug. By design this is not possible. You may be asking for some java code that is effected by such a bug.

The granularity at which NDC works is threads, so it distinguishes log outputs from different threads separately.</p>\n\n<p>In order to store thread specific tags, log4j's NDC class uses a Hashtable which is keyed by the Thread object itself (as opposed to say the thread id), and thus till the NDC tag stays in memory all the objects that hang off of the thread object also stay in memory. In our web application we use NDC to tag logoutputs with a request id to distinguish logs from a single request separately. The container that associates the NDC tag with a thread, also removes it while returning the response from a request. The problem occurred when during the course of processing a request, a child thread was spawned, something like the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pubclic class RequestProcessor {\n    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(RequestProcessor.class);\n    public void doSomething()  {\n        ....\n        final List&lt;String&gt; hugeList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(10000);\n        new Thread() {\n           public void run() {\n               logger.info(\"Child thread spawned\")\n               for(String s:hugeList) {\n                   ....\n               }\n           }\n        }.start();\n    }\n}    \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So an NDC context was associated with inline thread that was spawned. The thread object that was the key for this NDC context, is the inline thread which has the hugeList object hanging off of it. Hence even after the thread finished doing what it was doing, the reference to the hugeList was kept alive by the NDC context Hastable, thus causing a memory leak.</p>\n", "title": "Creating a memory leak with Java", "answer_id": 6781750, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6470651/creating-a-memory-leak-with-java/6781750#6781750", "tags": ["java", "memory", "memory-leaks"]}, {"body": "<p>Everyone always forgets the native code route.

This limits us a bit, but then again, that's the goal.

Well, because of a really \"weird\" step. Currently we have two doubles, 1 and 2, but we need to turn it into 12, there isn't any mathematic operation that we can do.\nWhat we're doing is divide the latter (lastdigit) by 10, in this fashion \n<code>2/10 = 0.2</code> (hence why double) like this:\n<code>\n    lastdigit = lastdigit/10;\n</code></p>\n\n<p>This is merely playing with numbers.

There's no plan to ship Pip to you. Manual instructions follow.</p>\n\n<h2>Python 2 \u2264 2.7.8 and Python 3 \u2264 3.3</h2>\n\n<p>Flying in the face of its <a href=\"http://www.python.org/about/\">'batteries included'</a> motto, Python ships without a package manager. To make matters worse, Pip was--until recently--ironically difficult to install.</p>\n\n<h3>Official instructions</h3>\n\n<p>Per <a href=\"http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html\">http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html</a>:</p>\n\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\"><code>get-pip.py</code></a>, being careful to save it as a <code>.py</code> file rather than <code>.txt</code>.

That's tedious for the experienced, and prohibitively difficult for newbies.</p>\n\n<p>For our sake, Christoph Gohlke prepares Windows installers (<code>.msi</code>) for popular Python packages.

Find <code>pip.exe</code> on your computer, then add its folder (for example, <code>C:\\Python27\\Scripts</code>) to your path (Start / Edit environment variables). Now you should be able to run <code>pip</code> from the command line. Try installing a package:</p>\n\n<pre><code>pip install httpie\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There you go (hopefully)! Solutions for common problems are given below:</p>\n\n<h3>Proxy problems</h3>\n\n<p>If you work in an office, you might be behind a HTTP proxy. If so, set the environment variables <a href=\"http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html\"><code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code></a>. Most Python applications (and other free software) respect these. Example syntax:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://proxy_url:port\nhttp://username:password@proxy_url:port\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you're really unlucky, your proxy might be a Microsoft <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT_LAN_Manager\">NTLM</a> proxy. Free software can't cope. The only solution is to install a free software friendly proxy that forwards to the nasty proxy. <a href=\"http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/\">http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/</a></p>\n\n<h3>Unable to find vcvarsall.bat</h3>\n\n<p>Python modules can be part written in C or C++.

The wrong way is to mark every ancestor from a given individual, and when traversing, if the person you're going to step to next is already marked, then cut the link. This will sever potentially accurate relationships. The correct way to do it is to start from each individual, and mark each ancestor with the path to that individual.

It's a part of the process of software engineering to decide, with which data you want to deal and which are out of scope.</p>\n\n<h1>Cyclic family graphs</h1>\n\n<p>Regarding family \"trees\" (in fact it are full blown graphs, including cycles), there is a nice anecdote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I married a widow who had a grown daughter. My father, who often visited us, fell in love with my step-daughter and married her. As a result, my father became my son, and my daughter became my mother. Some time later, I gave my wife a son, who was the brother of my father, and my uncle. My father's wife (who is also my daughter and my mother) got a son. As a result, I got a brother and  a grandson in the same person. My wife is now my grandmother, because she is my mother's mother. So I am the husband of my wife, and at the same time the step-grandson of my wife. In other words, I'm my own grandpa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Things get even more strange, when you take <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">surrogates</a> or \"fuzzy fatherhood\" into account. </p>\n\n<h1>How to deal with that</h1>\n\n<h2>Define cycles as out-of-scope</h2>\n\n<p>You could decide that your software should not deal with such rare cases. If such a case occurs, the user should use a different product. This makes dealing with the more common cases much more robust, because you can keep more assertions and a simpler data model.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, add some good import and export features to your software, so the user can easily migrate to a different product when necessary. </p>\n\n<h2>Allow manual relations</h2>\n\n<p>You could allow the user to add manual relations. These relations are not \"first-class citizens\", i.e. the software takes them as-is, doesn't check them and  doesn't handle them in the main data model. </p>\n\n<p>The user can then handle rare cases by hand. Your data model will still stay quite simple and your assertions will survive.</p>\n\n<p>Be careful with manual relations. There is a temptation to make them completely configurable and hence create a fully configurable data model. This will not work: Your software will not scale, you will get strange bugs and finally the user interface will become unusable. This anti-pattern is called <a href=\"http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Soft_Coding\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"soft coding\"</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.thedailywtf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"The daily WTF\"</a> is full of examples for that.</p>\n\n<h2>Make your data model more flexible, skip assertions, test invariants</h2>\n\n<p>The last resort would be making your data model more flexible. You would have to skip nearly all assertions and base your data model on a full blown graph. As the above example shows, it is easily possible to be your own grandfather, so you can even have cycles.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, you should extensively test your software. You had to skip nearly all assertions, so there is a good chance for additional bugs.</p>\n\n<p>Use a test data generator to check unusual test cases. There are quick check libraries for <a href=\"https://wiki.haskell.org/Introduction_to_QuickCheck1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Haskell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.quviq.com/products/erlang-quickcheck/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Erlang</a> or <a href=\"http://www.quviq.com/products/quickcheck-for-c/\" rel=\"nofollow\">C</a>. For Java / Scala there are <a href=\"http://scalacheck.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ScalaCheck</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/japgolly/nyaya\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nyaya</a>. One test idea would be to simulate a random population, let it interbreed at random, then let your software first import and then export the result. The expectation would be, that all connections in the output are also in the input and vice verse. </p>\n\n<p>A case, where a property stays the same is called an invariant. In this case, the invariant is the set of \"romantic relations\" between the individuals in the simulated population. Try to find as much invariants as possible and test them with randomly generated data. Invariants can be functional, e.g.:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>an uncle stays an uncle, even when you add more \"romantic relations\"</li>\n<li>every child has a parent</li>\n<li>a population with two generations has at least one grand-parent</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Or they can be technical:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your software will not crash on a graph up to 10 billion members (no matter how many interconnections)</li>\n<li>Your software scales with O(number-of-nodes) and O(number-of-edges^2)</li>\n<li>Your software can save and re-load every family graph up to 10 billion members</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By running the simulated tests, you will find lots of strange corner cases. Fixing them will take a lot of time. Also you will lose a lot of optimizations, your software will run much slower. You have to decide, if it is worth it and if this is in the scope of your software.</p>\n", "title": "Cycles in family tree software", "answer_id": 28151837, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6163683/cycles-in-family-tree-software/28151837#28151837", "tags": ["c++", "graph", "cycle", "assertions", "family-tree"]}], "question_id": 6163683}, {"body": "<p>So <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.6/\">jQuery 1.6</a> has the new function <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/prop/\"><code>prop()</code></a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(selector).click(function(){\n    //instead of:\n    this.getAttribute('style');\n    //do i use:\n    $(this).prop('style');\n    //or:\n    $(this).attr('style');\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or in this case do they do the same thing?</p>\n\n<p>And if I <em>do</em> have to switch to using <code>prop()</code>, all the old <code>attr()</code> calls will break if i switch to 1.6?</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>See this fiddle: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/maniator/JpUF2/\">http://jsfiddle.net/maniator/JpUF2/</a></p>\n\n<p>The console logs the <code>getAttribute</code> as a string, and the <code>attr</code> as a string, but the <code>prop</code> as a <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>, Why?

For years, they've been content with a function named <code>attr()</code> that mostly retrieved DOM properties, not the result you'd expect from the name. The segregation of <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/attr\"><code>attr()</code></a> and <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/prop\"><code>prop()</code></a> should help alleviate some of the confusion between HTML attributes and DOM properties. <code>$.fn.prop()</code> grabs the specified DOM property, while <code>$.fn.attr()</code> grabs the specified HTML attribute. </p>\n\n<p>To fully understand how they work, here's an extended explanation on the difference between HTML attributes and DOM properties.:</p>\n\n<h2>HTML Attributes</h2>\n\n<h3>Syntax:</h3>\n\n<p><code>&lt;body onload=\"foo()\"&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>\nAllows markup to have data associated with it for events, rendering, and other purposes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visualization:</strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NGBd6.png\" alt=\"HTML Attributes\">\nThe class attribute is shown here on the body. It's accessible through the following code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var attr;\nattr = document.body.getAttribute(\"class\");\n//IE 8 Quirks and below\nattr = document.body.getAttribute(\"className\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Attributes are returned in string form and can be inconsistent from browser to browser. However, they can be vital in some situations. As exemplified above, IE 8 Quirks Mode (and below) expects the name of a DOM property in get/set/removeAttribute instead of the attribute name. This is one of many reasons why it's important to know the difference.</p>\n\n<h2>DOM Properties</h2>\n\n<h3>Syntax:</h3>\n\n<p><code>document.body.onload = foo;</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>\nGives access to properties that belong to element nodes. These properties are similar to attributes, but are only accessible through JavaScript. This is an important difference that helps clarify the role of DOM properties. <strong>Please note that attributes are completely different from properties</strong>, as this event handler assignment is useless and won't receive the event (body doesn't have an onload event, only an onload attribute).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Visualization:</strong>\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/genBY.png\" alt=\"DOM Properties\"></p>\n\n<p>Here, you'll notice a list of properties under the \"DOM\" tab in Firebug. These are DOM properties. You'll immediately notice quite a few of them, as you'll have used them before without knowing it. Their values are what you'll be receiving through JavaScript.</p>\n\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=2weL0iAfrEMC&amp;lpg=PT334&amp;ots=_9VAqAT03C&amp;dq=html%20attributes%20vs%20dom%20properties&amp;pg=PT332#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">JavaScript: The Definitive Guide by\nDavid Flanagan</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Attributes\">HTML Attributes,\nMozilla Dev Center</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element#Properties\">DOM Element Properties, Mozilla Dev Center</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>HTML: <code>&lt;textarea id=\"test\" value=\"foo\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>JavaScript: <code>alert($('#test').attr('value'));</code></p>\n\n<p>In earlier versions of jQuery, this returns an empty string.

John Resig also <a href=\"http://ejohn.org/blog/jquery-16-and-attr/\">blogged about it</a>. I can see the difficulty they were in but still disagree with the recommendation to prefer <code>attr()</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Original answer</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you've only ever used jQuery and not the DOM directly, this could be a confusing change, although it is definitely an improvement conceptually. Not so good for the bazillions of sites using jQuery that will break as a result of this change though.</p>\n\n<p>I'll summarize the main issues:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You usually want <code>prop()</code> rather than <code>attr()</code>.</li>\n<li>In the majority of cases, <code>prop()</code> does what <code>attr()</code> used to do. Replacing calls to <code>attr()</code> with <code>prop()</code> in your code will generally work.</li>\n<li>Properties are generally simpler to deal with than attributes. An attribute value may only be a string whereas a property can be of any type. For example, the <code>checked</code> property is a Boolean, the <code>style</code> property is an object with individual properties for each style, the <code>size</code> property is a number.</li>\n<li>Where both a property and an attribute with the same name exists, usually updating one will update the other, but this is not the case for certain attributes of inputs, such as <code>value</code> and <code>checked</code>: for these attributes, the property always represents the current state while the attribute (except in old versions of IE) corresponds to the default value/checkedness of the input (reflected in the <code>defaultValue</code> / <code>defaultChecked</code> property).</li>\n<li>This change removes some of the layer of magic jQuery stuck in front of attributes and properties, meaning jQuery developers will have to learn a bit about the difference between properties and attributes. This is a good thing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you're a jQuery developer and are confused by this whole business about properties and attributes, you need to take a step back and learn a little about it, since jQuery is no longer trying so hard to shield you from this stuff. For the authoritative but somewhat dry word on the subject, there's the specs: <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/\">DOM4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/\">HTML DOM</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core\">DOM Level 2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/\">DOM Level 3</a>. Mozilla's DOM documentation is valid for most modern browsers and is easier to read than the specs, so you may find their <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/gecko_dom_reference\">DOM reference</a> helpful. There's a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element#Properties\">section on element properties</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As an example of how properties are simpler to deal with than attributes, consider a checkbox that is initially checked. Here are two possible pieces of valid HTML to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input id=\"cb\" type=\"checkbox\" checked&gt;\n&lt;input id=\"cb\" type=\"checkbox\" checked=\"checked\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, how do you find out if the checkbox is checked with jQuery? Look on Stack Overflow and you'll commonly find the following suggestions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>if ( $(\"#cb\").attr(\"checked\") === true ) {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>if ( $(\"#cb\").attr(\"checked\") == \"checked\" ) {...}</code></li>\n<li><code>if ( $(\"#cb\").is(\":checked\") ) {...}</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is actually the simplest thing in the world to do with the <code>checked</code> Boolean property, which has existed and worked flawlessly in every major scriptable browser since 1995:</p>\n\n<p><code>if (document.getElementById(\"cb\").checked) {...}</code></p>\n\n<p>The property also makes checking or unchecking the checkbox trivial:</p>\n\n<p><code>document.getElementById(\"cb\").checked = false</code></p>\n\n<p>In jQuery 1.6, this unambiguously becomes</p>\n\n<p><code>$(\"#cb\").prop(\"checked\", false)</code></p>\n\n<p>The idea of using the <code>checked</code> attribute for scripting a checkbox is unhelpful and unnecessary. The property is what you need.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It's not obvious what the correct way to check or uncheck the checkbox is using the <code>checked</code> attribute</li>\n<li>The attribute value reflects the default rather than the current visible state (except in some older versions of IE, thus making things still harder). The attribute tells you nothing about the whether the checkbox on the page is checked.

Like most objects in OOP, it has <em>properties</em>. It also, separately, has a map of the attributes defined on the element (usually coming from the markup that the browser read to create the element). Some of the element's <em>properties</em> get their <em>initial</em> values from <em>attributes</em> with the same or similar names (<code>value</code> gets its initial value from the \"value\" attribute; <code>href</code> gets its initial value from the \"href\" attribute, but it's not exactly the same value; <code>className</code> from the \"class\" attribute). Other properties get their initial values in other ways: For instance, the <code>parentNode</code> property gets its value based on what its parent element is; an element always has a <code>style</code> property, whether it has a \"style\" attribute or not.</p>\n\n<p>Let's consider this anchor in a page at <code>http://example.com/testing.html</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href='foo.html' class='test one' name='fooAnchor' id='fooAnchor'&gt;Hi&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Some gratuitous ASCII art (and leaving out a lot of stuff):</p>\n\n<pre><code>+-------------------------------------------+\n| a                                         |\n+-------------------------------------------+\n| href:       \"http://example.com/foo.html\" |\n| name:       \"fooAnchor\"                   |\n| id:         \"fooAnchor\"                   |\n| className:  \"test one\"                    |\n| attributes:                               |\n|    href:  \"foo.html\"                      |\n|    name:  \"fooAnchor\"                     |\n|    id:    \"fooAnchor\"                     |\n|    class: \"test one\"                      |\n+-------------------------------------------+\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the properties and attributes are distinct.</p>\n\n<p>Now, although they are distinct, because all of this evolved rather than being designed from the ground up, a number of properties write back to the attribute they derived from if you set them. But not all do, and as you can see from <code>href</code> above, the mapping is not always a straight \"pass the value on\", sometimes there's interpretation involved.</p>\n\n<p>When I talk about properties being properties of an object, I'm not speaking in the abstract. Here's some non-jQuery code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var link = document.getElementById('fooAnchor');\nalert(link.href);                 // alerts \"http://example.com/foo.html\"\nalert(link.getAttribute(\"href\")); // alerts \"foo.html\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Those values are as per most browsers; there's some variation.)</p>\n\n<p>The <code>link</code> object is a real thing, and you can see there's a real distinction between accessing a <em>property</em> on it, and accessing an <em>attribute</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As Tim said, the <strong>vast majority</strong> of the time, we want to be working with properties. Partially that's because their values (even their names) tend to be more consistent across browsers. We mostly only want to work with attributes when there is no property related to it (custom attributes), or when we know that for that particular attribute, the attribute and the property are not 1:1 (as with <code>href</code> and \"href\" above).</p>\n\n<p>The standard properties are laid out in the various DOM specs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/\">DOM2 HTML</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/\">DOM2 Core</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/\">DOM3 Core</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These specs have excellent indexes and I recommend keeping links to them handy; I use them all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Custom attributes would include, for instance, any <code>data-xyz</code> attributes you might put on elements to provide meta-data to your code (now that that's valid as of HTML5, as long as you stick to the <code>data-</code> prefix). (Recent versions of jQuery give you access to <code>data-xyz</code> elements via the <code>data</code> function, but that function does more than that and if you're just dealing with a <code>data-xyz</code> attribute, I'd actually use the <code>attr</code> function to interact with it.)</p>\n\n<p>The <code>attr</code> function used to have some convoluted logic around getting what they thought you wanted, rather than literally getting the attribute. It conflated the concepts. Moving to <code>prop</code> and <code>attr</code> is meant to de-conflate them. There will be some brief confusion, but hopefully a better understanding of what's really going on going forward.</p>\n\n<p>Some time kicking around the specs above, and experimenting, should help clear some of this up.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: jQuery 1.6.1 changes the <code>attr</code> function again, in ways that the jQuery team say mean most code that currently uses <code>attr</code> will continue to work, even if <code>prop</code> would technically be preferred.

For others, it's just an added layer of confusion. Let's clear that up.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to see the difference between <code>.attr</code> and <code>.prop</code> is the following example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input blah=\"hello\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong><code>$('input').attr('blah')</code></strong>: returns <code>'hello'</code> as expected.

In general, all the code given there fulfills the requirements of a minimal reproducible example: data is provided, minimal code is provided, and everything is runnable.</p>\n\n<h2>Producing a minimal dataset</h2>\n\n<p>For most cases, this can be easily done by just providing a vector / data frame with some values. Or you can use one of the built-in datasets, which are provided with most packages.<br>\nA comprehensive list of built-in datasets can be seen with <code>library(help = \"datasets\")</code>. There is a short description to every dataset and more information can be obtained for example with <code>?mtcars</code> where 'mtcars' is one of the datasets in the list. Other packages might contain additional datasets. </p>\n\n<p>Making a vector is easy. Sometimes it is necessary to add some randomness to it, and there are a whole number of functions to make that. <code>sample()</code> can randomize a vector, or give a random vector with only a few values. <code>letters</code> is a useful vector containing the alphabet. This can be used for making factors.</p>\n\n<p>A few examples :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>random values : <code>x &lt;- rnorm(10)</code> for normal distribution, <code>x &lt;- runif(10)</code> for uniform distribution, ...</li>\n<li>a permutation of some values : <code>x &lt;- sample(1:10)</code> for vector 1:10 in random order.</li>\n<li>a random factor : <code>x &lt;- sample(letters[1:4], 20, replace = TRUE)</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For matrices, one can use <code>matrix()</code>, eg :</p>\n\n<pre><code>matrix(1:10, ncol = 2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Making data frames can be done using <code>data.frame()</code>. One should pay attention to name the entries in the data frame, and to not make it overly complicated.</p>\n\n<p>An example :</p>\n\n<pre><code>Data &lt;- data.frame(\n    X = sample(1:10),\n    Y = sample(c(\"yes\", \"no\"), 10, replace = TRUE)\n)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For some questions, specific formats can be needed. For these, one can use any of the provided <code>as.someType</code> functions : <code>as.factor</code>, <code>as.Date</code>, <code>as.xts</code>, ... These in combination with the vector and/or data frame tricks.</p>\n\n<h2>Copy your data</h2>\n\n<p>If you have some data that would be too difficult to construct using these tips, then you can always make a subset of your original data, using eg <code>head()</code>, <code>subset()</code> or the indices. Then use eg. <code>dput()</code> to give us something that can be put in R immediately :</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; dput(head(iris,4))\nstructure(list(Sepal.Length = c(5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6), Sepal.Width = c(3.5, \n3, 3.2, 3.1), Petal.Length = c(1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5), Petal.Width = c(0.2, \n0.2, 0.2, 0.2), Species = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), .Label = c(\"setosa\", \n\"versicolor\", \"virginica\"), class = \"factor\")), .Names = c(\"Sepal.Length\", \n\"Sepal.Width\", \"Petal.Length\", \"Petal.Width\", \"Species\"), row.names = c(NA, \n4L), class = \"data.frame\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If your data frame has a factor with many levels, the <code>dput</code> output can be unwieldy because it will still list all the possible factor levels even if they aren't present in the the subset of your data. To solve this issue, you can use the <code>droplevels()</code> function. Notice below how species is a factor with only one level:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; dput(droplevels(head(iris, 4)))\nstructure(list(Sepal.Length = c(5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6), Sepal.Width = c(3.5, \n3, 3.2, 3.1), Petal.Length = c(1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5), Petal.Width = c(0.2, \n0.2, 0.2, 0.2), Species = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), .Label = \"setosa\",\nclass = \"factor\")), .Names = c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\", \n\"Petal.Length\", \"Petal.Width\", \"Species\"), row.names = c(NA, \n4L), class = \"data.frame\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Worst case scenario, you can give a text representation that can be read in using the <code>text</code> parameter of <code>read.table</code> :</p>\n\n<pre><code>zz &lt;- \"Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\"\n\nData &lt;- read.table(text=zz, header = TRUE)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Producing minimal code</h2>\n\n<p>This should be the easy part but often isn't. What you should not do, is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>add all kind of data conversions. Make sure the provided data is already in the correct format (unless that is the problem of course)</li>\n<li>copy-paste a whole function / chunk of code that gives an error. First try to locate which lines exactly result in the error. More often than not you'll find out what the problem is yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>What you should do, is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>add which packages should be used if you use any.</li>\n<li>if you open connections or make files, add some code to close them or delete the files (using <code>unlink()</code>)</li>\n<li>if you change options, make sure the code contains a statement to revert them back to the original ones. (eg <code>op &lt;- par(mfrow=c(1,2)) ...some code... par(op)</code> )</li>\n<li>test run your code in a new, empty R session to make sure the code is runnable. People should be able to just copy-paste your data and your code in the console and get exactly the same as you have.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Give extra information</h2>\n\n<p>In most cases, just the R version and the operating system will suffice. When conflicts arise with packages, giving the output of <code>sessionInfo()</code> can really help. When talking about connections to other applications (be it through ODBC or anything else), one should also provide version numbers for those, and if possible also the necessary information on the setup. </p>\n", "title": "How to make a great R reproducible example?", "answer_id": 5963610, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610", "tags": ["r", "r-faq"]}, {"body": "<p>The R-help mailing list has a <a href=\"http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html\">posting guide</a> which covers both asking and answering questions, including an example of generating data:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Examples: Sometimes it helps to\n  provide a small example that someone\n  can actually run.

A reproducible example allows someone else to recreate your problem by just copying and pasting R code. </p>\n\n<p>There are four things you need to include to make your example reproducible: required packages, data, code, and a description of your R environment.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Packages</strong> should be loaded at the top of the script, so it's easy to\nsee which ones the example needs.</p></li>\n<li><p>The easiest way to include <strong>data</strong> in an email or Stack Overflow question is to use <code>dput()</code> to generate\nthe R code to recreate it. For example, to recreate the <code>mtcars</code> dataset in R,\nI'd perform the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Run <code>dput(mtcars)</code> in R</li>\n<li>Copy the output</li>\n<li>In my reproducible script, type <code>mtcars &lt;-</code> then paste.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Spend a little bit of time ensuring that your <strong>code</strong> is easy for others to\nread:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>make sure you've used spaces and your variable names are concise, but\ninformative</p></li>\n<li><p>use comments to indicate where your problem lies</p></li>\n<li><p>do your best to remove everything that is not related to the problem.<br>\nThe shorter your code is, the easier it is to understand.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Include the output of <code>sessionInfo()</code> in a comment in your code. This summarises your <strong>R\nenvironment</strong> and makes it easy to check if you're using an out-of-date\npackage.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can check you have actually made a reproducible example by starting up a fresh R session and pasting your script in.  </p>\n\n<p>Before putting all of your code in an email, consider putting it on <a href=\"http://gist.github.com/\">http://gist.github.com/</a>.

To do so:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Provide input data</li>\n<li>Provide expected output</li>\n<li>Explain your problem succinctly\n<ul>\n<li>if you have over 20 lines of text + code you can probably go back and simplify</li>\n<li>simplify your code as much as possible while preserving the problem / error</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This does take some work, but seems like a fair trade off since you are asking others to do work for you.</p>\n\n<h2>Providing Data:</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Built-in Data Sets</h3>\n\n<p>The best option <strong>by far</strong> is to rely on built-in data sets.  This makes it very easy for others to work on your problem.  Type <code>data()</code> at the R prompt to see what data is available to you.  Some classic examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>iris</code></li>\n<li><code>mtcars</code></li>\n<li><code>ggplot2::diamonds</code> (external package, but almost everyone has it)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See this <strong><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28863686/how-can-i-quickly-inspect-built-in-data-sets-psa\">SO QA</a></strong> for how to find data sets suitable for your problem.</p>\n\n<p>If you are able to rephrase your problem to use the built-in data sets you are much more likely to get good answers (and upvotes).</p>\n\n<h3>Self Generated Data</h3>\n\n<p>If your problem is very specific to a type of data that is not represented in the existing data sets, then provide the R code that generates the <strong>smallest</strong> possible data set that your problem manifests itself on.  For example</p>\n\n<pre><code>set.seed(1)  # important to make random data reproducible\nmyData &lt;- data.frame(a=sample(letters[1:5], 20, rep=T), b=runif(20))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now someone trying to answer my question can copy/paste those two lines and start working on the problem immediately.</p>\n\n<h3>dput</h3>\n\n<p>As a <strong>last resort</strong>, you can use <code>dput</code> to transform a data object to R code (e.g. <code>dput(myData)</code>).  I say as a \"last resort\" because the output of <code>dput</code> is often fairly unwieldy, annoying to copy-paste, and obscures the rest of your question.</p>\n\n<h2>Provide Expected Output:</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Someone once said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A picture of expected output is worth 1000 words</p>\n  \n  <p>-- a very wise person</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you can add something like \"I expected to get this result\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>   cyl   mean.hp\n1:   6 122.28571\n2:   4  82.63636\n3:   8 209.21429\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to your question people are much more likely to quickly understand what you are trying to do.  If your expected result is large and unwieldy, then you probably haven't thought enough about how to simplify your problem (see next).</p>\n\n<h2>Explain Your Problem Succinctly</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The main thing to do is to simplify your problem as much as possible before you ask your question.  Re-framing the problem to work with the built in data sets will help a lot in this regard.  You will also often find that just by going through the process of simplification you will answer your own problem.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples of good questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8484664/how-do-you-code-an-r-function-so-that-it-knows-to-look-in-data-for-the-varia\">built in data set</a></li>\n<li>with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24351451/how-to-concatenate-strings-in-a-specified-order\">user generated data</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In both cases the user's problems are almost certainly not with the simple examples they provide.  Rather they abstracted the nature of their problem and applied it to a simple data set to ask their question.</p>\n\n<h2>Why Yet Another Answer To This Question?</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This answer focuses on what I think is best practice: use built in data sets and provide what you expect as a result in minimal form.  The most prominent answers focus on other aspects.  I don't expect this answer to rise to any prominence; this is here solely so that I can link to it in comments to newbie questions.</p>\n", "title": "How to make a great R reproducible example?", "answer_id": 28481250, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/28481250#28481250", "tags": ["r", "r-faq"]}, {"body": "<p>I am developing the <a href=\"https://github.com/trinker/wakefield\"><strong><em>wakefield</em></strong> package</a> to address this need to quickly share reproducible data, sometimes <code>dput</code> works fine for smaller data sets but many of the problems we deal with are much larger, sharing such a large data set via <code>dput</code> is impractical.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>About:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/trinker/wakefield\"><strong><em>wakefield</em></strong></a> allows the user to share minimal code to reproduce data.

Will not serve <em>any</em> resources from the cache - gets fresh copies from the server without sending any <code>if-modified-since</code> or <code>if-none-match</code> headers in the request.</p>\n\n<p>Equivalent to the user doing a \"hard reload\" in browsers where that's possible.</p>\n\n<p>Note that passing <code>true</code> to <code>location.reload()</code> is supported in Firefox (see <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload\">MDN</a>) and Internet Explorer (see <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536691(v=vs.85).aspx\">MSDN</a>) but is not supported universally and is not part of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#location\">the W3 HTML 5 spec</a>, nor <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#the-location-interface\">the W3 draft HTML 5.1 spec</a>, nor <a href=\"https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#the-location-interface\">the WHATWG HTML Living Standard</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In unsupporting browsers, like Google Chrome, <code>location.reload(true)</code> behaves the same as <code>location.reload()</code>.</p></li>\n<li><h3><strong><em><code>location.reload()</code></em></strong> or <strong><em><code>location.reload(false)</code></em></strong></h3>\n\n<p>Reloads the page, fetching a fresh, non-cached copy of the page HTML itself, and performing <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234\">RFC 7234</a> revalidation requests for any resources (like scripts) that the browser has cached, <em>even if they are <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2\">fresh</a></em> are RFC 7234 permits the browser to serve them without revalidation.</p>\n\n<p>Exactly how the browser should utilise its cache when performing a <code>location.reload()</code> call isn't specified or documented as far as I can tell; I determined the behaviour above by experimentation.</p>\n\n<p>This is equivalent to the user simply pressing the \"refresh\" button in their browser.</p></li>\n<li><h3><strong><em><code>location = location</code></em></strong> (or infinitely many other possible techniques that involve assigning to <code>location</code> or to its properties)</h3>\n\n<p>Only works if the page's URL doesn't contain a fragid/hashbang!</p>\n\n<p>Reloads the page without refetching or revalidating <em>any</em> <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2\">fresh</a> resources from the cache.

Let me start by saying that the accepted answer is good, and I up-voted it, but it isn't the only way and it does have some down-sides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>AsyncTask's created as non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to the enclosing Activity object, its context, and the entire View hierarchy created by that activity. This reference prevents the Activity from being garbage collected until the AsyncTask's background work completes. If the user's connection is slow, and/or the download is large, these short-term memory leaks can become a problem - for example if the orientation changes several times (and you don't cancel the executing tasks), or the user navigates away from the Activity.</li>\n<li>AsyncTask has different execution characteristics depending on the platform it executes on: prior to API level 4 AsyncTasks execute serially on a single background thread; from API level 4 through API level 10, AsyncTasks execute on a pool of up to 128 threads; from API level 11 onwards AsyncTask executes serially on a single background thread (unless you use the overloaded <code>executeOnExecutor</code> method and supply an alternative executor). Code that works fine when run serially on ICS may break when executed concurrently on Gingerbread, say, if you have inadvertent order-of-execution dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid short-term memory leaks, have well defined execution characteristics across all platforms, and have a base to build really robust network handling, you might want to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Using a library that does a nice job of this for you - there's a nice comparison of networking libs in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16902716/comparison-of-android-networking-libraries-okhttp-retrofit-volley\">this question</a>, or</li>\n<li>Using a <code>Service</code> or <code>IntentService</code> instead, perhaps with a <code>PendingIntent</code> to return the result via the Activity's <code>onActivityResult</code> method.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>IntentService approach</h2>\n\n<p>Down-sides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>More code and complexity than <code>AsyncTask</code>, though not as much as you might think</li>\n<li>Will queue requests and run them on a <em>single</em> background thread. You can easily control this by replacing <code>IntentService</code> with an equivalent <code>Service</code> implementation, perhaps like <a href=\"https://github.com/steveliles/AsyncAndroid/blob/master/AsyncAndroid/src/main/java/com/packt/asyncandroid/chapter6/ConcurrentIntentService.java\">this one</a>.</li>\n<li>Um, I can't think of any others right now actually</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Up-sides:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Avoids the short-term memory leak problem</li>\n<li>If your activity restarts while network operations are in-flight it can still receive the result of the download via its <code>onActivityResult</code> method</li>\n<li>Better platform than AsyncTask to build and re-use robust networking code. Example: if you need to do an important upload, you could do it from <code>AsyncTask</code> in an <code>Activity</code>, but if the user context-switches out of the app to take a phone-call, the system <em>may</em> kill the app before the upload completes. It is <em>less likely</em> to kill an application with an active <code>Service</code>.</li>\n<li>If you use your own concurrent version of <code>IntentService</code> (like the one I linked above) you can control the level of concurrency via the <code>Executor</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Implementation summary</h2>\n\n<p>You can implement an <code>IntentService</code> to perform downloads on a single background thread quite easily.</p>\n\n<p>Step 1: Create an <code>IntentService</code> to perform the download. You can tell it what to download via <code>Intent</code> extra's, and pass it a <code>PendingIntent</code> to use to return the result to the <code>Activity</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>import android.app.IntentService;\nimport android.app.PendingIntent;\nimport android.content.Intent;\nimport android.util.Log;\n\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.net.MalformedURLException;\nimport java.net.URL;\n\npublic class DownloadIntentService extends IntentService {\n\n    private static final String TAG = DownloadIntentService.class.getSimpleName();\n\n    public static final String PENDING_RESULT_EXTRA = \"pending_result\";\n    public static final String URL_EXTRA = \"url\";\n    public static final String RSS_RESULT_EXTRA = \"url\";\n\n    public static final int RESULT_CODE = 0;\n    public static final int INVALID_URL_CODE = 1;\n    public static final int ERROR_CODE = 2;\n\n    private IllustrativeRSSParser parser;\n\n    public DownloadIntentService() {\n        super(TAG);\n\n        // make one and re-use, in the case where more than one intent is queued\n        parser = new IllustrativeRSSParser();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) {\n        PendingIntent reply = intent.getParcelableExtra(PENDING_RESULT_EXTRA);\n        InputStream in = null;\n        try {\n            try {\n                URL url = new URL(intent.getStringExtra(URL_EXTRA));\n                IllustrativeRSS rss = parser.parse(in = url.openStream());\n\n                Intent result = new Intent();\n                result.putExtra(RSS_RESULT_EXTRA, rss);\n\n                reply.send(this, RESULT_CODE, result);\n            } catch (MalformedURLException exc) {\n                reply.send(INVALID_URL_CODE);\n            } catch (Exception exc) {\n                // could do better by treating the different sax/xml exceptions individually\n                reply.send(ERROR_CODE);\n            }\n        } catch (PendingIntent.CanceledException exc) {\n            Log.i(TAG, \"reply cancelled\", exc);\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Step 2: Register the service in the manifest:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;service\n        android:name=\".DownloadIntentService\"\n        android:exported=\"false\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Step 3: Invoke the service from the Activity, passing a PendingResult object which the Service will use to return the result:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PendingIntent pendingResult = createPendingResult(\n    RSS_DOWNLOAD_REQUEST_CODE, new Intent(), 0);\nIntent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), DownloadIntentService.class);\nintent.putExtra(DownloadIntentService.URL_EXTRA, URL);\nintent.putExtra(DownloadIntentService.PENDING_RESULT_EXTRA, pendingResult);\nstartService(intent);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Step 4: Handle the result in onActivityResult:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@Override\nprotected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {\n    if (requestCode == RSS_DOWNLOAD_REQUEST_CODE) {\n        switch (resultCode) {\n            case DownloadIntentService.INVALID_URL_CODE:\n                handleInvalidURL();\n                break;\n            case DownloadIntentService.ERROR_CODE:\n                handleError(data);\n                break;\n            case DownloadIntentService.RESULT_CODE:\n                handleRSS(data);\n                break;\n        }\n        handleRSS(data);\n    }\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A github project containing a complete working Android-Studio/gradle project is available <a href=\"https://github.com/steveliles/Android-Download-Service-Example\">here</a>.</p>\n", "title": "How to fix android.os.NetworkOnMainThreadException?", "answer_id": 21284021, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6343166/how-to-fix-android-os-networkonmainthreadexception/21284021#21284021", "tags": ["android", "networkonmainthread", "thread-exceptions"]}, {"body": "<p>This is only thrown for applications targeting the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#Android_3.0_Honeycomb_.28API_level_11.29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Honeycomb</a> SDK or higher.

This means you either set it to <code>null</code>, or you never set it to anything at all. </p>\n\n<p>Like anything else, <code>null</code> gets passed around. If it is <code>null</code> <em>in</em> method \"A\", it could be that method \"B\" passed a <code>null</code> <em>to</em> method \"A\".</p>\n\n<p>The rest of this article goes into more detail and shows mistakes that many programmers often make which can lead to a <code>NullReferenceException</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>More Specifically</h2>\n\n<p>The runtime throwing a <code>NullReferenceException</code> <strong>always</strong> means the same thing: you are trying to use a reference. The reference is not initialized (or it <em>was</em> initialized, but is no <em>longer</em> initialized). </p>\n\n<p>This means the reference is <code>null</code>, and you cannot access members through a <code>null</code> reference. The simplest case:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string foo = null;\nfoo.ToUpper();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will throw a <code>NullReferenceException</code> at the second line, because you can't call the instance method <code>ToUpper()</code> on a <code>string</code> reference pointing to <code>null</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>Debugging</h1>\n\n<p>How do you find the source of a <code>NullReferenceException</code>? Apart from looking at the exception itself, which will be thrown exactly at the location where it occurs, the general rules of debugging in Visual Studio apply: place strategic breakpoints and <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/esta7c62.aspx\">inspect your variables</a>, either by hovering the mouse over their names, opening a (Quick)Watch window or using the various debugging panels like Locals and Autos.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to find out where the reference is or isn't set, right-click its name and select \"Find All References\". You can then place a breakpoint at every found location and run your program with the debugger attached. Every time the debugger breaks on such a breakpoint, you need to determine whether you expect the reference to be non-null, inspect the variable and and verify that it points to an instance when you expect it to.</p>\n\n<p>By following the program flow this way you can find the location where the instance should not be null, and why it isn't properly set.</p>\n\n<h1>Examples</h1>\n\n<p>Some common scenarios where the exception can be thrown:</p>\n\n<h3>Generic</h3>\n\n<pre><code>ref1.ref2.ref3.member\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If ref1 or ref2 or ref3 is null, then you'll get a <code>NullReferenceException</code>. If you want to solve the problem, then find out which one is null by rewriting the expression to its simpler equivalent:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var r1 = ref1;\nvar r2 = r1.ref2;\nvar r3 = r2.ref3;\nr3.member\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Specifically, in <code>HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.Name</code>, the <code>HttpContext.Current</code> could be null, or the <code>User</code> property could be null, or the <code>Identity</code> property could be null.</p>\n\n<h3>Indirect</h3>\n\n<pre><code>public class Person {\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n}\npublic class Book {\n    public Person Author { get; set; }\n}\npublic class Example {\n    public void Foo() {\n        Book b1 = new Book();\n        int authorAge = b1.Author.Age; // You never initialized the Author property.\n                                       // there is no Person to get an Age from.\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you want to avoid the child (Person) null reference you could initialize it in the parent (Book) object's constructor.</p>\n\n<p>The same applies to nested object initializers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Book b1 = new Book { Author = { Age = 45 } };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While the <code>new</code> keyword is used, it only creates a new instance of <code>Book</code>, but not a new instance of <code>Person</code>, so the <code>Author</code> the property is still <code>null</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Array</h3>\n\n<pre><code>int[] numbers = null;\nint n = numbers[0]; // numbers is null.

When you return an empty model (or model property) from your controller, the exception occurs when the views accesses it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Controller\npublic class Restaurant:Controller\n{\n    public ActionResult Search()\n    {\n         return View();  // Forgot the provide a Model here.\n    }\n}\n\n// Razor view \n@foreach (var restaurantSearch in Model.RestaurantSearch)  // Throws.\n{\n}\n\n&lt;p&gt;@Model.somePropertyName&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- Also throws --&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>WPF Control Creation Order and Events</h3>\n\n<p>WPF controls are created during the call to <code>InitializeComponent</code> in the order they appear in the visual tree.  A <code>NullReferenceException</code> will be raised in the case of early-created controls with event handlers, etc, that fire during <code>InitializeComponent</code> which reference late-created controls.</p>\n\n<p>For example :</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Combobox declared first --&gt;\n    &lt;ComboBox Name=\"comboBox1\" \n              Margin=\"10\"\n              SelectedIndex=\"0\" \n              SelectionChanged=\"comboBox1_SelectionChanged\"&gt;\n        &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"Item 1\" /&gt;\n        &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"Item 2\" /&gt;\n        &lt;ComboBoxItem Content=\"Item 3\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/ComboBox&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Label declared later --&gt;\n    &lt;Label Name=\"label1\" \n           Content=\"Label\"\n           Margin=\"10\" /&gt;\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here <code>comboBox1</code> is created before <code>label1</code>.

So be aware of that.</p>\n\n<h3>LINQ FirstOrDefault() and SingleOrDefault()</h3>\n\n<p>The plain versions <code>First()</code> and <code>Single()</code> throw exceptions when there is nothing. The \"OrDefault\" versions return null in that case. So be aware of that.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Ways to Avoid</h1>\n\n<h3>Explicitly check for <code>null</code>, and ignore null values.</h3>\n\n<p>If you expect the reference sometimes to be null, you can check for it being <code>null</code> before accessing instance members:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void PrintName(Person p) {\n    if (p != null) {\n        Console.WriteLine(p.Name);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Explicitly check for <code>null</code>, and provide a default value.</h3>\n\n<p>Methods calls you expect to return an instance can return <code>null</code>, for example when the object being sought cannot be found. You can choose to return a default value when this is the case:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string GetCategory(Book b) {\n    if (b == null)\n        return \"Unknown\";\n    return b.Category;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Explicitly check for <code>null</code> from method calls and throw a custom exception.</h3>\n\n<p>You can also throw a custom exception, only to catch it in the calling code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string GetCategory(string bookTitle) {\n    var book = library.FindBook(bookTitle);  // This may return null\n    if (book == null)\n        throw new BookNotFoundException(bookTitle);  // Your custom exception\n    return book.Category;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Use <code>Debug.Assert</code> if a value should never be <code>null</code>, to catch the problem earlier than the exception occurs.</h3>\n\n<p>When you know during development that a method maybe can, but actually never should return <code>null</code>, you can use <code>Debug.Assert()</code> to break as soon as possible when it does occur:</p>\n\n<pre><code>string GetTitle(int knownBookID) {\n    // You know this should never return null.\n    var book = library.GetBook(knownBookID);  \n\n    // Exception will occur on the next line instead of at the end of this method.\n    Debug.Assert(book != null, \"Library didn't return a book for known book ID.\");\n\n    // Some other code ...\n\n    return book.Title; // Will never throw NullReferenceException in Debug mode.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Though this check <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3021538/debug-assert-appears-in-release-mode\">will not end up in your release build</a>, causing it to throw the <code>NullReferenceException</code> again when <code>book == null</code> at runtime in release mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Use <code>GetValueOrDefault()</code> for nullable value types to provide a default value when they are <code>null</code>.</h3>\n\n<pre><code>DateTime? appointment = null;\nConsole.WriteLine(appointment.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.Now));\n// Will display the default value provided (DateTime.Now), because appointment is null.\n\nappointment = new DateTime(2022, 10, 20);\nConsole.WriteLine(appointment.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.Now));\n// Will display the appointment date, not the default\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Use the null coalescing operator: <code>??</code> [C#] or <code>If()</code> [VB].</h3>\n\n<p>The shorthand to providing a default value when a <code>null</code> is encountered:</p>\n\n<pre><code>IService CreateService(ILogger log, Int32? frobPowerLevel)\n{\n    var serviceImpl = new MyService(log ?? NullLog.Instance);\n\n    // Note that the above \"GetValueOrDefault()\" can also be rewritten to use\n    // the coalesce operator:\n    serviceImpl.FrobPowerLevel = frobPowerLevel ?? 5;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Use the null condition operator: <code>?.</code> (available in C# 6 and VB.NET 14):</h3>\n\n<p>This is also sometimes called the safe navigation or Elvis (after its shape) operator. If the expression on the left side of the operator is null, then the right side will not be evaluated and null is returned instead. That means cases like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var title = person.Title.ToUpper();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the person does not have a title, this will throw an exception because it is trying to call <code>ToUpper</code> on a property with a null value.</p>\n\n<p>In C# 5 and below, this can be guarded with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var title = person.Title == null ? null : person.Title.ToUpper();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the title variable will be null instead of throwing an exception. C# 6 introduces a shorter syntax for this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var title = person.Title?.ToUpper();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will result in the title variable being null, and the call to ToUpper is not made if <code>person.Title</code> is null.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, you <em>still</em> have to check <code>title</code> for null or use the null condition operator together with the null coalescing operator (<code>??</code>) to supply a default value:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// regular null check\nint titleLength = 0;\nif (title != null)\n    titleLength = title.Length; // If title is null, this would throw NullReferenceException\n\n// combining the `?` and the `??` operator\nint titleLength = title?.Length ?? 0;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "What is a NullReferenceException, and how do I fix it?", "answer_id": 4660186, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4660142/what-is-a-nullreferenceexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it/4660186#4660186", "tags": ["c#", ".net", "vb.net", "null", "nullreferenceexception"]}, {"body": "<p>Be aware that regardless of the scenario, the cause is always the same in .NET:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You are trying to use a reference variable whose value is <code>Nothing</code>/<code>null</code>.

After all, they are both reporting the same exception defined in the .NET Framework which they both use. Causes unique to Visual Basic are rare (perhaps only one).</p>\n\n<p>This answer will use Visual Basic terms, syntax and context. The examples used come from a large number of past Stack&nbsp;Overflow questions. This is to maximize relevance by using the <em>kinds</em> of situations often seen in posts. A bit more explanation is also provided for those who might need it. An example similar to yours is <em>very</em> likely listed here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is concept-based: there is no code for you to paste into your project. It is intended to help you understand what causes a NullReferenceException (NRE), how to find it, how to fix it, and how to avoid it. An NRE can be caused many ways so this is unlikely to be your sole encounter.</li>\n<li>The examples (from Stack&nbsp;Overflow posts) do not always show the best way to do something in the first place.</li>\n<li>Typically, the simplest remedy is used.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Basic Meaning</h2>\n\n<p>The message <em>\"Object not set to instance of Object\"</em> means you are trying to use an object which has not been initialized. This boils down to one of these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your code <em>declared</em> an object variable, but it did not <em>initialize</em> it (create an instance or '<em>instantiate</em>' it)</li>\n<li>Something which your code assumed would initialize an object, did not</li>\n<li>Possibly, other code prematurely invalidated an object still in use</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Finding The Cause</h2>\n\n<p>Since the problem is an object reference which is <code>Nothing</code>, the answer is to examine them to find out which one. Then determine why it is not initialized. Hold the mouse over the various variables and Visual Studio (VS) will show their values - the culprit will be <code>Nothing</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5ndSA.jpg\" alt=\"IDE debug display\"></p>\n\n<p>You should also remove any Try/Catch blocks from the relevant code, especially ones where there is nothing in the Catch block. This will cause your code to crash when it tries to use an object which is Nothing. <strong>This is what you want</strong>, because it will identify the exact <em>location</em> of the problem, and allow you to identify the object causing it.</p>\n\n<p>A <code>MsgBox</code> in the Catch which displays <code>Error while...</code> will be of little help. This method also leads to <em>very bad</em> Stack&nbsp;Overflow questions, because the you can't describe the actual exception, the object involved or even the line of code where it happens.</p>\n\n<p>You can also use the <code>Locals Window</code> (<strong>Debug -> Windows -> Locals</strong>) to examine your objects.</p>\n\n<p>Once you know what and where the problem is, it is usually fairly easy to fix and faster than posting a new question.</p>\n\n<p>See also:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ktf38f66.aspx\">Breakpoints</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xtd0s8kd(v=vs.110).aspx\">MSDN: How to: Use the Try/Catch Block to Catch Exceptions</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/seyhszts(v=vs.110).aspx\">MSDN: Best Practices for Exceptions</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Examples and Remedies</h2>\n\n<h2>Class Objects / Creating an Instance</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim reg As CashRegister\n...\nTextBox1.Text = reg.Amount         ' NRE\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The problem is that <code>Dim</code> does not create a CashRegister <em>object</em>; it only declares a variable named <code>reg</code> of that Type. <em>Declaring</em> an object variable and creating an <em>instance</em> are two different things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<p>The <code>New</code> operator can often be used to create the instance when you declare it:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim reg As New CashRegister        ' [New] creates instance, invokes the constructor\n\n' Longer, more explicit form:\nDim reg As CashRegister = New CashRegister\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When it is only appropriate to create the instance later:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Private reg As CashRegister         ' Declare\n  ...\nreg = New CashRegister()            ' Create instance\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: <strong>Do not</strong> use <code>Dim</code> again in a procedure, including the constructor (Sub New):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Private reg As CashRegister\n'...\n\nPublic Sub New()\n   '...\n   Dim reg As New CashRegister\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will create a <em>local</em> variable, <code>reg</code>, which exists only in that context (sub).

The <em>Scope</em> of the variable - whether it exists for the entire module/class or is local to a procedure - is determined by <em>where</em> it is declared. <code>Private | Friend | Public</code> defines the access level, not <em>Scope</em>.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/77s47661.aspx\">New Operator</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t0wsc67.aspx\">Scope in Visual Basic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/76453kax.aspx\">Access Levels in Visual Basic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/t63sy5hs.aspx\">Value Types and Reference Types</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>Arrays must also be instantiated:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Private arr as String()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This array has only been declared, not created. There are several ways to initialize an array:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Private arr as String() = New String(10){}\n' or\nPrivate arr() As String = New String(10){}\n\n' For a local array (in a procedure) and using 'Option Infer':\nDim arr = New String(10) {}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: Beginning with VS 2010, when initializing a local array using a literal and <code>Option Infer</code>, the <code>As &lt;Type&gt;</code> and <code>New</code> elements are optional:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim myDbl As Double() = {1.5, 2, 9.9, 18, 3.14}\nDim myDbl = New Double() {1.5, 2, 9.9, 18, 3.14}\nDim myDbl() = {1.5, 2, 9.9, 18, 3.14}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The data Type and array size are inferred from the data being assigned. Class/Module level declarations still require <code>As &lt;Type&gt;</code> with <code>Option Strict</code>:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Private myDoubles As Double() = {1.5, 2, 9.9, 18, 3.14}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example: Array of class objects</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim arrFoo(5) As Foo\n\nFor i As Integer = 0 To arrFoo.Count - 1\n   arrFoo(i).Bar = i * 10       ' Exception\nNext\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The array has been created, but the <code>Foo</code> objects in it have not.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>For i As Integer = 0 To arrFoo.Count - 1\n    arrFoo(i) = New Foo()         ' Create Foo instance\n    arrFoo(i).Bar = i * 10\nNext\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using a <code>List(Of T)</code> will make it quite difficult to have an element without a valid object:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim FooList As New List(Of Foo)     ' List created, but it is empty\nDim f As Foo                        ' Temporary variable for the loop\n\nFor i As Integer = 0 To 5\n    f = New Foo()                    ' Foo instance created\n    f.Bar =  i * 10\n    FooList.Add(f)                   ' Foo object added to list\nNext\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more information, see:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384665.aspx\">Option Infer Statement</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1t0wsc67.aspx\">Scope in Visual Basic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wak0wfyt.aspx\">Arrays in Visual Basic</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Lists and Collections</h2>\n\n<p>.NET collections (of which there are many varieties - Lists, Dictionary, etc.) must also instantiated or created.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Private myList As List(Of String)\n..\nmyList.Add(\"ziggy\")           ' NullReference\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You get the same exception for the same reason - <code>myList</code> was only declared, but no instance created. The remedy is the same:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>myList = New List(Of String)\n\n' Or create instance when declared:\nPrivate myList As New List(Of String)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A common oversight is a class which uses a collection Type:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Public Class Foo\n    Private barList As List(Of Bar)\n\n    Friend Function BarCount As Integer\n        Return barList.Count\n    End Function\n\n    Friend Sub AddItem(newBar As Bar)\n        If barList.Contains(newBar) = False Then\n            barList.Add(newBar)\n        End If\n    End Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Either procedure will result in a NRE, because <code>barList</code> is only declared, not instantiated. Creating an instance of <code>Foo</code> will not also create an instance of the internal <code>baList</code>. It may have been the intent to do this in the constructor:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Public Sub New         ' Constructor\n    ' Stuff to do when a new Foo is created...\n    barList = New List(Of Bar)\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As before, this is incorrect:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Public Sub New()\n    ' Creates another barList local to this procedure\n     Dim barList As New List(Of Bar)\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6sh2ey19(v=vs.110).aspx\">List(Of T) Class</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Data Provider Objects</h2>\n\n<p>Working with databases presents many opportunities for a NullReference because there can be many objects (Command, Connection, Transaction, Dataset, DataTable, DataRows....) in use at once.  <strong>Note:</strong> It does not matter which data provider you are using -- MySQL, SQL Server, OleDB, etc. -- the <em>concepts</em> are the same.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim da As OleDbDataAdapter\nDim ds As DataSet\nDim MaxRows As Integer\n\ncon.Open()\nDim sql = \"SELECT * FROM tblfoobar_List\"\nda = New OleDbDataAdapter(sql, con)\nda.Fill(ds, \"foobar\")\ncon.Close()\n\nMaxRows = ds.Tables(\"foobar\").Rows.Count      ' Error\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As before, the <code>ds</code> Dataset object was declared, but an instance was never created. The <code>DataAdapter</code> will fill an existing <code>DataSet</code>, not create one. In this case, since <code>ds</code> is a local variable, <em>the IDE warns you</em> that that this might happen:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/E5d94.jpg\" alt=\"img\"></p>\n\n<p>When declared as a module/class level variable, as appears to be the case with <code>con</code>, the compiler can't know if the object was created by an upstream procedure. Do not ignore warnings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim ds As New DataSet\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>ds = New DataSet\nda = New OleDBDataAdapter(sql, con)\nda.Fill(ds, \"Employees\")\n\ntxtID.Text = ds.Tables(\"Employee\").Rows(0).Item(1)\ntxtID.Name = ds.Tables(\"Employee\").Rows(0).Item(2)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A typo is the problem here: <code>Employees</code> vs <code>Employee</code>. There was no <code>DataTable</code> named \"Employee\" created, so a NullReference results trying to access it. Another potential problem is assuming there will be <code>Items</code> which may not be so when the SQL includes a WHERE clause.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since this uses one table, using <code>Tables(0)</code> will avoid spelling errors.  Examining <code>Rows.Count</code> can also help:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>If ds.Tables(0).Rows.Count &gt; 0 Then\n    txtID.Text = ds.Tables(0).Rows(0).Item(1)\n    txtID.Name = ds.Tables(0).Rows(0).Item(2)\nEnd If\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Fill</code> is a function returning the number of Rows affected which can also be tested:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>If da.Fill(ds, \"Employees\") &gt; 0 Then...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim da As New OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter(\"SELECT TICKET.TICKET_NO,\n        TICKET.CUSTOMER_ID, ... FROM TICKET_RESERVATION AS TICKET INNER JOIN\n        FLIGHT_DETAILS AS FLIGHT ... WHERE [TICKET.TICKET_NO]= ...\", con)\nDim ds As New DataSet\nda.Fill(ds)\n\nIf ds.Tables(\"TICKET_RESERVATION\").Rows.Count &gt; 0 Then\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The DataAdapter will provide <code>TableNames</code> as shown in the previous example, but it does not parse names from the SQL or database table. As a result, <code>ds.Tables(\"TICKET_RESERVATION\")</code> references a non-existent table.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Remedy</strong> is the same, reference the table by index:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>If ds.Tables(0).Rows.Count &gt; 0 Then\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Data.DataTable(v=vs.110).aspx\">DataTable Class</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Object Paths / Nested</h2>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>If myFoo.Bar.Items IsNot Nothing Then\n   ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code is only testing <code>Items</code> while both <code>myFoo</code> and <code>Bar</code> may also be Nothing. The <strong>remedy</strong> is to test the entire chain or path of objects one at a time:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>If (myFoo IsNot Nothing) AndAlso\n    (myFoo.Bar IsNot Nothing) AndAlso\n    (myFoo.Bar.Items IsNot Nothing) Then\n    ....\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>AndAlso</code> is important. Subsequent tests will not be performed once the first <code>False</code> condition is encountered. This allows the code to safely 'drill' into the object(s) one 'level' at a time, evaluating <code>myFoo.Bar</code> only after (and if) <code>myFoo</code> is determined to be valid. Object chains or paths can get quite long when coding complex objects:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>myBase.myNodes(3).Layer.SubLayer.Foo.Files.Add(\"somefilename\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It is not possible to reference anything 'downstream' of a null Object.  This also applies to controls:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>myWebBrowser.Document.GetElementById(\"formfld1\").InnerText = \"some value\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, <code>myWebBrowser</code> or <code>Document</code> could be Nothing, or the <code>formfld1</code> element may not exist.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>UI Controls</h2>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim cmd5 As New SqlCommand(\"select Cartons, Pieces, Foobar \" _\n     &amp; \"FROM Invoice where invoice_no = '\" &amp; _\n     Me.ComboBox5.SelectedItem.ToString.Trim &amp; \"' And category = '\" &amp; _\n     Me.ListBox1.SelectedItem.ToString.Trim &amp; \"' And item_name = '\" &amp; _\n     Me.ComboBox2.SelectedValue.ToString.Trim &amp; \"' And expiry_date = '\" &amp; _\n     Me.expiry.Text &amp; \"'\", con)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Among other things, this code does not anticipate that the user may not have selected something in one or more UI controls.  <code>ListBox1.SelectedItem</code> may well be Nothing, so <code>ListBox1.SelectedItem.ToString</code> will result in an NRE.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Validate data before using it (also use <code>Option Strict</code> and SQL parameters):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Dim expiry As DateTime         ' for text date validation\nIf (ComboBox5.SelectedItems.Count &gt; 0) AndAlso\n    (ListBox1.SelectedItems.Count &gt; 0) AndAlso\n    (ComboBox2.SelectedItems.Count &gt; 0) AndAlso\n    (DateTime.TryParse(expiry.Text, expiry) Then\n\n    '... do stuff\nElse\n    MessageBox.Show(...error message...)\nEnd If\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can use <code>(ComboBox5.SelectedItem IsNot Nothing) AndAlso...</code></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Visual Basic Forms</h2>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Public Class Form1\n\n    Private NameBoxes = New TextBox(5) {Controls(\"TextBox1\"), _\n                   Controls(\"TextBox2\"), Controls(\"TextBox3\"), _\n                   Controls(\"TextBox4\"), Controls(\"TextBox5\"), _\n                   Controls(\"TextBox6\")}\n\n    ' same thing in a different format:\n    Private boxList As New List(Of TextBox) From {TextBox1, TextBox2, TextBox3 ...}\n\n    ' Immediate NRE:\n    Private somevar As String = Me.Controls(\"TextBox1\").Text\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a fairly common way to get an NRE. In C#, depending on how it is coded, the IDE will report that <code>Controls</code> does not exist in the current context, or \"cannot reference non static member\". So, to some extent this is a VB-only situation. It is also complex, because it can result in failure cascade.</p>\n\n<p><em>The arrays and collections cannot be initialized this way.</em> This initialization code will run <em>before</em> the constructor creates the Form or the Controls. As a result:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lists and Collection will be simply be empty</li>\n<li>The Array will contain five elements of Nothing</li>\n<li>The <code>somevar</code> assignment will result in an immediate NRE, because Nothing does not have a <code>.Text</code> property</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Referencing array elements later will result in a NRE. If you do this in <code>Form_Load</code>, due to an odd bug, the IDE <em>may not</em> report the exception when it happens. The exception will pop up <em>later</em> when your code tries to use the array. This \"silent exception\" is <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/4934010/1070452\">detailed in this post</a>. For our purposes, the key is that when something catastrophic happens while creating a form (Sub New or Form Load event), exceptions may go unreported, the code exits the procedure and just displays the form.</p>\n\n<p>Since no other code in your Sub New or Form Load event will run after the NRE, <em>a great many other things</em> can be left uninitialized.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Sub Form_Load(..._\n   '...\n   Dim name As String = NameBoxes(2).Text        ' NRE\n   ' ...\n   ' More code (which will likely not be executed)\n   ' ...\nEnd Sub\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> this applies to any and all control and component references making these illegal where they are:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Public Class Form1\n\n    Private myFiles() As String = Me.OpenFileDialog1.FileName &amp; ...\n    Private dbcon As String = OpenFileDialog1.FileName &amp; \";Jet Oledb...\"\n    Private studentName As String = TextBox13.Text\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Partial Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is curious that VB does not provide a warning, but the remedy is to <strong>declare</strong> the containers at the form level, but <strong>initialize</strong> them in form load event handler when the controls <strong>do</strong> exist. This can be done in <code>Sub New</code> as long as your code is after the <code>InitializeComponent</code> call:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>' Module level declaration\nPrivate NameBoxes as TextBox()\nPrivate studentName As String\n\n' Form Load, Form Shown or Sub New:\n'\n' Using the OP's approach (illegal using OPTION STRICT)\nNameBoxes = New TextBox() {Me.Controls(\"TextBox1\"), Me.Controls(\"TestBox2\"), ...)\nstudentName = TextBox32.Text           ' For simple control references\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The array code may not be out of the woods yet. Any controls which are in a container control (like a GroupBox or Panel) will not be found in <code>Me.Controls</code>; they will be in the Controls collection of that Panel or GroupBox. Nor will a control be returned when the control name is misspelled (\"TeStBox2\"). In such cases, <code>Nothing</code> will again be stored in those array elements and a NRE will result when you attempt to reference it.</p>\n\n<p>These should be easy to find now that you know what you are looking for:\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5ndSA.jpg\" alt=\"VS shows you the error of your ways\"></p>\n\n<p>\"Button2\" resides on a Panel</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rather than indirect references by name using the form's Controls collection, use the control reference:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>' Declaration\nPrivate NameBoxes As TextBox()\n\n' Initialization -  simple and easy to read, hard to botch:\nNameBoxes = New TextBox() {TextBox1, TextBox2, ...)\n\n' Initialize a List\nNamesList = New List(Of TextBox)({TextBox1, TextBox2, TextBox3...})\n' or\nNamesList = New List(Of TextBox)\nNamesList.AddRange({TextBox1, TextBox2, TextBox3...})\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Function Returning Nothing</h2>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>Private bars As New List(Of Bars)        ' Declared and created\n\nPublic Function BarList() As List(Of Bars)\n    bars.Clear\n    If someCondition Then\n        For n As Integer = 0 to someValue\n            bars.Add(GetBar(n))\n        Next n\n    Else\n        Exit Function\n    End If\n\n    Return bars\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a case where the IDE will warn you that '<em>not all paths return a value and a NullReference Exception may result</em>'. You can suppress the warning, by replacing <code>Exit Function</code> with <code>Return Nothing</code>, but that does not solve the problem. Anything which tries to use the return when <code>someCondition = False</code> will result in a NRE:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-vb prettyprint-override\"><code>bList = myFoo.BarList()\nFor Each b As Bar in bList      ' EXCEPTION\n      ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Replace <code>Exit Function</code> in the function with <code>Return bList</code>. Returning an <em>empty</em> List is not the same as returning Nothing.

After the Catch does nothing, <code>Finally</code> tries to perform clean up, but since you cannot <code>Close</code> a null DataReader object, a brand new NullReferenceException results.</p>\n\n<p>An empty Catch block is the devil's playground. This OP was baffled why he was getting an NRE in the Finally block. In other situations, an empty Catch may result in something else much further downstream going haywire and cause you to spend time looking at the wrong things in the wrong place for the problem. (The \"silent exception\" described above provides the same entertainment value.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remedy</strong></p>\n\n<p>Don't use empty Try/Catch blocks - let the code crash so you can a) identify the cause b) identify the location and c) apply a proper remedy.

This means you need to set class <em>invariants</em>, and/or even function/method <em>preconditions</em> and <em>postconditions</em> on your system, while developing.</p>\n\n<p>In short, <em>class invariants</em> ensure that there will be some constraints in your class that will not get violated in normal use (and therefore, the class will not get in an inconsistent state). <em>Preconditions</em> mean that data given as input to a function/method must follow some constraints set and <strong>never</strong> violate them, and <em>postconditions</em> mean that a function/method output must follow the set constraints again without ever violating them.\nContract conditions should <strong>never</strong> be violated during execution of a bug-free program, therefore design by contract is checked in practice in debug mode, while being <em>disabled in releases</em>, to maximize the developed system performance.</p>\n\n<p>This way, you can avoid <code>NullReferenceException</code> cases that are results of violation of the constraints set. For example, if you use an object property <code>X</code> in a class and later try to invoke one of its methods and <code>X</code> has a null value, then this will lead to <code>NullReferenceException</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public X { get; set; }\n\npublic void InvokeX()\n{\n  X.DoSomething(); // if X value is null, you will get a NullReferenceException\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But if you set \"property X must never have a null value\" as method precondition, then you can prevent the scenario described before:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Using code contracts:\n[ContractInvariantMethod]\nprotected void ObjectInvariant () \n{\n  Contract.Invariant ( X != null );\n  //...\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For this cause, <em>Code Contracts</em> project exists for .NET applications (take a look <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264808%28v=vs.110%29.aspx\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, design by contract can be applied using <em>assertions</em> (look <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_%28software_development%29\">here</a> for more).</p>\n", "title": "What is a NullReferenceException, and how do I fix it?", "answer_id": 27651666, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4660142/what-is-a-nullreferenceexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it/27651666#27651666", "tags": ["c#", ".net", "vb.net", "null", "nullreferenceexception"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Try using <code>Html.Partial</code> instead of <code>Renderpage</code></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I was getting <code>Object reference not set to an instance of an object</code> when I tried to render a View within a View by sending it a Model, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@{\n    MyEntity M = new MyEntity();\n}\n@RenderPage(\"_MyOtherView.cshtml\", M); // error in _MyOtherView, the Model was Null\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Debugging showed the model was Null inside MyOtherView.

For example here is a struct that you can use to catch null references. It's modeled after the same concept as <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCode]\npublic struct NotNull&lt;T&gt; where T : class\n{\n    private T _value;\n\n    public T Value\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (_value == null)\n            {\n                throw new Exception(\"null value not allowed\");\n            }\n\n            return _value;\n        }\n        set\n        {\n            if (value == null)\n            {\n                throw new Exception(\"null value not allowed.\");\n            }\n\n            _value = value;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator T(NotNull&lt;T&gt; notNullValue)\n    {\n        return notNullValue.Value;\n    }\n\n    public static implicit operator NotNull&lt;T&gt;(T value)\n    {\n        return new NotNull&lt;T&gt; { Value = value };\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You would use very similar to the same way you would use <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code>, except with the goal of accomplishing exactly the opposite - to not allow <code>null</code>. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n<pre><code>NotNull&lt;Person&gt; person = null; // throws exception\nNotNull&lt;Person&gt; person = new Person(); // OK\nNotNull&lt;Person&gt; person = GetPerson(); // throws exception if GetPerson() returns null\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>NotNull&lt;T&gt;</code> is implicitly casted to and from <code>T</code> so you can use it just about anywhere you need it. For example you can pass a <code>Person</code> object to a method that takes a <code>NotNull&lt;Person&gt;</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person person = new Person { Name = \"John\" };\nWriteName(person);\n\npublic static void WriteName(NotNull&lt;Person&gt; person)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(person.Value.Name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see above as with nullable you would access the underlying value through the <code>Value</code> property. Alternatively, you can use explicit or implicit cast, you can see an example with the return value below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person person = GetPerson();\n\npublic static NotNull&lt;Person&gt; GetPerson()\n{\n    return new Person { Name = \"John\" };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or you can even use it when the method just returns <code>T</code> (in this case <code>Person</code>) by doing a cast. For example the following code would just just like the code above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person person = (NotNull&lt;Person&gt;)GetPerson();\n\npublic static Person GetPerson()\n{\n    return new Person { Name = \"John\" };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Combine with Extension</strong></p>\n\n<p>Combine <code>NotNull&lt;T&gt;</code> with an extension method and you can cover even more situations. Here is an example of what the extension method can look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerNonUserCode]\npublic static class NotNullExtension\n{\n    public static T NotNull&lt;T&gt;(this T @this) where T : class\n    {\n        if (@this == null)\n        {\n            throw new Exception(\"null value not allowed\");\n        }\n\n        return @this;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here is an example of how it could be used:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var person = GetPerson().NotNull();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>GitHub</p>\n\n<p>For your reference I made the code above available on GitHub, you can find it at:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/luisperezphd/NotNull\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/luisperezphd/NotNull</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Language Feature</strong></p>\n\n<p>C# 6.0 introduced the \"null-conditional operator\" that helps with this a little. With this feature you can reference nested objects and if any one of them is <code>null</code> the whole expression returns <code>null</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This reduces the number of null checks you have to do in some cases. The syntax is to put a question mark before each dot. Take the following code for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var address = country?.State?.County?.City;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Imagine that <code>country</code> is an object of type <code>Country</code> that has a property called <code>State</code> and so on.

For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"javascript\" charset=\"UTF-8\" src=\"/script.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a charset=\"UTF-8\" href=\"http://example.com/\"&gt;Example Site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Consistency helps to reduce errors and make code more readable.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the charset attribute is case-insensitive. You can use UTF-8 or utf-8, however UTF-8 is clearer, more readable, more accurate.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there is absolutely no reason at all to use any value other than UTF-8 in the meta charset attribute or page header. UTF-8 is the default encoding for Web documents since HTML4 in 1999 and the only practical way to make modern Web pages.</p>\n\n<p>Also you should not use HTML entities in UTF-8. Characters like the copyright symbol should be typed directly. The only entities you should use are for the 5 reserved markup characters: less than, greater than, ampersand, prime, double prime. Entities need an HTML parser, which you may not always want to use going forward, they introduce errors, make your code less readable, increase your file sizes, and sometimes decode incorrectly in various browsers depending on which entities you used. Learn how to type/insert copyright, trademark, open quote, close quote, apostrophe, em dash, en dash, bullet, Euro, and any other characters you encounter in your content, and use those actual characters in your code. The Mac has a Character Viewer that you can turn on in the Keyboard System Preference, and you can find and then drag and drop the characters you need, or use the matching Keyboard Viewer to see which keys to type. For example, trademark is Option+2. UTF-8 contains all of the characters and symbols from every written human language. So there is no excuse for using -- instead of an em dash. It is not a bad idea to learn the rules of punctuation and typography also ... for example, knowing that a period goes inside a close quote, not outside.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Using a  tag for something like content-type and encoding is highly\n  ironic, since without knowing those things, you couldn't parse the file \n  to get the value of the meta tag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No, that is not true. The browser starts out parsing the file as the browser's default encoding, either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. Since US-ASCII is a subset of both ISO-8859-1 <em>and</em> UTF-8, the browser can read  just fine either way ... it is the same. When the browser encounters the meta charset tag, if the encoding is different than what the browser is already using, the browser reloads the page in the specified encoding. That is why we put the meta charset tag at the top, right after the head tag, before anything else, even the title. That way you can use UTF-8 characters in your title.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must save your file(s) in UTF-8 encoding without BOM</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is not strictly true. If you only have US-ASCII characters in your document, you can Save it as US-ASCII and serve it as UTF-8, because it is a subset. But if there are Unicode characters, you are correct, you must Save as UTF-8 without BOM.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you want a good text editor that will save your files\n  in UTF-8, I recommend Notepad++. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the Mac, use Bare Bones TextWrangler (free) from Mac App Store, or Bare Bones BBEdit which is at Mac App Store for $39.99 ... very cheap for such a great tool. In either app, there is a menu at the bottom of the document window where you specify the document encoding and you can easily choose \"UTF-8 no BOM\". And of course you can set that as the default for new documents in Preferences.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But if your Webserver serves the encoding in the HTTP header,\n  which is recommended, both [meta tags] are needless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is incorrect. You should of course set the encoding in the HTTP header, but you should also set it in the meta charset attribute so that the page can be Saved by the user, out of the browser onto local storage and then Opened again later, in which case the only indication of the encoding that will be present is the meta charset attribute. You should also set a base tag for the same reason ... on the server, the base tag is unnecessary, but when opened from local storage, the base tag enables the page to work as if it is on the server, with all the assets in place and so on, no broken links.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>AddDefaultCharset UTF-8</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or you can just change the encoding of particular file types like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>AddType text/html;charset=utf-8 html\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A tip for serving both UTF-8 and Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) files is to give the UTF-8 files a \"text\" extension and Latin-1 files \"txt.\"</p>\n\n<pre><code>AddType text/plain;charset=iso-8859-1 txt\nAddType text/plain;charset=utf-8 text\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, consider Saving your documents with Unix line endings, not legacy DOS or (classic) Mac line endings, which don't help and may hurt, especially down the line as we get further and further from those legacy systems. An HTML document with valid HTML5, UTF-8 encoding, and Unix line endings is a job well done. You can share and edit and store and read and recover and rely on that document in many contexts. It's lingua franca. It's digital paper.</p>\n", "title": "&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; vs &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot;&gt;", "answer_id": 7134485, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4696499/meta-charset-utf-8-vs-meta-http-equiv-content-type/7134485#7134485", "tags": ["html5", "meta-tags", "doctype"]}, {"body": "<p><strong><code>&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;</code> was introduced with/for HTML5.</strong></p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the documentation, both are valid.

It makes reference to an <em>abstract machine</em> that is a generalization of actual systems.  In the Language Lawyer world, the job of the programmer is to write code for the abstract machine; the job of the compiler is to actualize that code on a concrete machine.  By coding rigidly to the spec, you can be certain that your code will compile and run without modification on any system with a compliant C++ compiler, whether today or 50 years from now.</p>\n\n<p>The abstract machine in the C++98/C++03 specification is fundamentally single-threaded.  So it is not possible to write multi-threaded C++ code that is \"fully portable\" with respect to the spec.  The spec does not even say anything about the <em>atomicity</em> of memory loads and stores or the <em>order</em> in which loads and stores might happen, never mind things like mutexes.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, you can write multi-threaded code in practice for particular concrete systems -- like pthreads or Windows.  But there is no <em>standard</em> way to write multi-threaded code for C++98/C++03.</p>\n\n<p>The abstract machine in C++11 is multi-threaded by design.  It also has a well-defined <em>memory model</em>; that is, it says what the compiler may and may not do when it comes to accessing memory.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following example, where a pair of global variables are accessed concurrently by two threads:</p>\n\n<pre><code>           Global\n           int x, y;\n\nThread 1            Thread 2\nx = 17;             cout &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; \" \";\ny = 37;             cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What might Thread 2 output?</p>\n\n<p>Under C++98/C++03, this is not even Undefined Behavior; the question itself is <em>meaningless</em> because the standard does not contemplate anything called a \"thread\".</p>\n\n<p>Under C++11, the result is Undefined Behavior, because loads and stores need not be atomic in general.  Which may not seem like much of an improvement...  And by itself, it's not.</p>\n\n<p>But with C++11, you can write this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>           Global\n           atomic&lt;int&gt; x, y;\n\nThread 1                 Thread 2\nx.store(17);             cout &lt;&lt; y.load() &lt;&lt; \" \";\ny.store(37);             cout &lt;&lt; x.load() &lt;&lt; endl;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now things get much more interesting.  First of all, the behavior here is <em>defined</em>.  Thread 2 could now print <code>0 0</code> (if it runs before Thread 1), <code>37 17</code> (if it runs after Thread 1), or <code>0 17</code> (if it runs after Thread 1 assigns to x but before it assigns to y).</p>\n\n<p>What it cannot print is <code>37 0</code>, because the default mode for atomic loads/stores in C++11 is to enforce <em>sequential consistency</em>.  This just means all loads and stores must be \"as if\" they happened in the order you wrote them within each thread, while operations among threads can be interleaved however the system likes.  So the default behavior of atomics provides both <em>atomicity</em> and <em>ordering</em> for loads and stores.</p>\n\n<p>Now, on a modern CPU, ensuring sequential consistency can be expensive.  In particular, the compiler is likely to emit full-blown memory barriers between every access here.  But if your algorithm can tolerate out-of-order loads and stores; i.e., if it requires atomicity but not ordering; i.e., if it can tolerate <code>37 0</code> as output from this program, then you can write this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>           Global\n           atomic&lt;int&gt; x, y;\n\nThread 1                            Thread 2\nx.store(17,memory_order_relaxed);   cout &lt;&lt; y.load(memory_order_relaxed) &lt;&lt; \" \";\ny.store(37,memory_order_relaxed);   cout &lt;&lt; x.load(memory_order_relaxed) &lt;&lt; endl;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The more modern the CPU, the more likely this is to be faster than the previous example.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you just need to keep particular loads and stores in order, you can write:</p>\n\n<pre><code>           Global\n           atomic&lt;int&gt; x, y;\n\nThread 1                            Thread 2\nx.store(17,memory_order_release);   cout &lt;&lt; y.load(memory_order_acquire) &lt;&lt; \" \";\ny.store(37,memory_order_release);   cout &lt;&lt; x.load(memory_order_acquire) &lt;&lt; endl;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This takes us back to the ordered loads and stores -- so <code>37 0</code> is no longer a possible output -- but it does so with minimal overhead.  (In this trivial example, the result is the same as full-blown sequential consistency; in a larger program, it would not be.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, if the only outputs you want to see are <code>0 0</code> or <code>37 17</code>, you can just wrap a mutex around the original code.  But if you have read this far, I bet you already know how that works, and this answer is already longer than I intended :-).</p>\n\n<p>So, bottom line. Mutexes are great, and C++11 standardizes them. But sometimes for performance reasons you want lower-level primitives (e.g., the classic <a href=\"http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/threading/multithreading-in-c++0x-part-6-double-checked-locking.html\">double-checked locking pattern</a>).  The new standard provides high-level gadgets like mutexes and condition variables, and it also provides low-level gadgets like atomic types and the various flavors of memory barrier.  So now you can write sophisticated, high-performance concurrent routines entirely within the language specified by the standard, and you can be certain your code will compile and run unchanged on both today's systems and tomorrow's.</p>\n\n<p>Although to be frank, unless you are an expert and working on some serious low-level code, you should probably stick to mutexes and condition variables.  That's what I intend to do.</p>\n\n<p>For more on this stuff, see <a href=\"http://bartoszmilewski.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/c-atomics-and-memory-ordering/\">this blog post</a>.</p>\n", "title": "C++11 introduced a standardized memory model.

However, I hope it provides a mental image (a pictorial representation) that facilitates reasoning about memory consistency models.</p>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s view the histories of all memory locations in a space-time diagram in which the horizontal axis represents the address space (i.e., each memory location is represented by a point on that axis) and the vertical axis represents time (we will see that, in general, there is not a universal notion of time). The history of values held by each memory location is, therefore, represented by a vertical column at that memory address. Each value change is due to one of the threads writing a new value to that location. By a <strong><em>memory image</em></strong>, we will mean the aggregate/combination of values of all memory locations observable <strong><em>at a particular time</em></strong> by <strong><em>a particular thread</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Quoting from <a href=\"http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00346ED1V01Y201104CAC016\">\"A Primer on Memory Consistency and Cache Coherence\"</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The intuitive (and most restrictive) memory model is sequential consistency (SC) in which a multithreaded execution should look like an interleaving of the sequential executions of each constituent thread, as if the threads were time-multiplexed on a single-core processor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That global memory order can vary from one run of the program to another and may not be known beforehand. The characteristic feature of SC is the set of horizontal slices in the address-space-time diagram representing <strong><em>planes of simultaneity</em></strong> (i.e., memory images). On a given plane, all of its events (or memory values) are simultaneous. There is a notion of <em>Absolute Time</em>, in which all threads agree on which memory values are simultaneous. In SC, at every time instant, there is only one memory image shared by all threads. That's, at every instant of time, all processors agree on the memory image (i.e., the aggregate content of memory). Not only does this imply that all threads view the same sequence of values for all memory locations, but also that all processors observe the same <em>combinations of values</em> of all variables. This is the same as saying all memory operations (on all memory locations) are observed in the same total order by all threads.</p>\n\n<p>In relaxed memory models, each thread will slice up address-space-time in its own way, the only restriction being that slices of each thread shall not cross each other because all threads must agree on the history of every individual memory location (of course, slices of different threads may, and will, cross each other). There is no universal way to slice it up (no privileged foliation of address-space-time). Slices do not have to be planar (or linear). They can be curved and this is what can make a thread read values written by another thread out of the order they were written in. Histories of different memory locations may slide (or get stretched) arbitrarily relative to each other <strong><em>when viewed by any particular thread</em></strong>. Each thread will have a different sense of which events (or, equivalently, memory values) are simultaneous. The set of events (or memory values) that are simultaneous to one thread are not simultaneous to another. Thus, in a relaxed memory model, all threads still observe the same history (i.e., sequence of values) for each memory location. But they may observe different memory images (i.e., combinations of values of all memory locations). Even if two different memory locations are written by the same thread in sequence, the two newly written values may be observed in different order by other threads.</p>\n\n<p>[Picture from Wikipedia]\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Relsim2.GIF\" alt=\"Picture from Wikipedia\"></p>\n\n<p>Readers familiar with Einstein\u2019s <strong>Special Theory of Relativity</strong> will notice what I am alluding to. Translating Minkowski\u2019s words into the memory models realm: address space and time are shadows of address-space-time. In this case, each observer (i.e., thread) will project shadows of events (i.e., memory stores/loads) onto his own world-line (i.e., his time axis) and his own plane of simultaneity (his address-space axis). Threads in the C++11 memory model correspond to <strong><em>observers</em></strong> that are moving relative to each other in special relativity. Sequential consistency corresponds to the <strong>Galilean space-time</strong> (i.e., all observers agree on one absolute order of events and a global sense of simultaneity).</p>\n\n<p>The resemblance between memory models and special relativity stems from the fact that both define a partially-ordered set of events, often called a causal set. Some events (i.e., memory stores) can affect (but not be affected by) other events. A C++11 thread (or observer in physics) is no more than a chain (i.e., a totally ordered set) of events (e.g., memory loads and stores to possibly different addresses).</p>\n\n<p>In relativity, some order is restored to the seemingly chaotic picture of partially ordered events, since the only temporal ordering that all observers agree on is the ordering among \u201ctimelike\u201d events (i.e., those events that are in principle connectible by any particle going slower than the speed of light in a vacuum). Only the timelike related events are invariantly ordered.\n<a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/ccallender/index.html\">Time in Physics, Craig Callender</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In C++11 memory model, a similar mechanism (the acquire-release consistency model) is used to establish these <strong><em>local causality relations</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>To provide a definition of memory consistency and a motivation for abandoning SC, I will quote from <a href=\"http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00346ED1V01Y201104CAC016\">\"A Primer on Memory Consistency and Cache Coherence\"</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For a shared memory machine, the memory consistency model defines the architecturally visible behavior of its memory system. The correctness criterion for a single processor core partitions behavior between \u201c<em>one correct result</em>\u201d and \u201c<em>many incorrect alternatives</em>\u201d. This is because the processor\u2019s architecture mandates that the execution of a thread transforms a given input state into a single well-defined output state, even on an out-of-order core. Shared memory consistency models, however, concern the loads and stores of multiple threads and usually allow <em>many correct executions</em> while disallowing many (more) incorrect ones. The possibility of multiple correct executions is due to the ISA allowing multiple threads to execute concurrently, often with many possible legal interleavings of instructions from different threads.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>Relaxed</em></strong> or <strong><em>weak</em></strong> memory consistency models are motivated by the fact that most memory orderings in strong models are unnecessary. If a thread updates ten data items and then a synchronization flag, programmers usually do not care if the data items are updated in order with respect to each other but only that all data items are updated before the flag is updated (usually implemented using FENCE instructions). Relaxed models seek to capture this increased ordering flexibility and preserve only the orders that programmers \u201c<em>require</em>\u201d to get both higher performance and correctness of SC. For example, in certain architectures, FIFO write buffers are used by each core to hold the results of committed (retired) stores before writing the results to the caches. This optimization enhances performance but violates SC. The write buffer hides the latency of servicing a store miss. Because stores are common, being able to avoid stalling on most of them is an important benefit. For a single-core processor, a write buffer can be made architecturally invisible by ensuring that a load to address A returns the value of the most recent store to A even if one or more stores to A are in the write buffer. This is typically done by either bypassing the value of the most recent store to A to the load from A, where \u201cmost recent\u201d is determined by program order, or by stalling a load of A if a store to A is in the write buffer. When multiple cores are used, each will have its own bypassing write buffer. Without write buffers, the hardware is SC, but with write buffers, it is not, making write buffers architecturally visible in a multicore processor.</p>\n  \n  <p>Store-store reordering may happen if a core has a non-FIFO write buffer that lets stores depart in a different order than the order in which they entered. This might occur if the first store misses in the cache while the second hits or if the second store can coalesce with an earlier store (i.e., before the first store). Load-load reordering may also happen on dynamically-scheduled cores that execute instructions out of program order. That can behave the same as reordering stores on another core (Can you come up with an example interleaving between two threads?). Reordering an earlier load with a later store (a load-store reordering) can cause many incorrect behaviors, such as loading a value after releasing the lock that protects it (if the store is the unlock operation). Note that store-load reorderings may also arise due to local bypassing in the commonly implemented FIFO write buffer, even with a core that executes all instructions in program order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because cache coherence and memory consistency are sometimes confused, it is instructive to also have this quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unlike consistency, <strong><em>cache coherence</em></strong> is neither visible to software nor required. Coherence seeks to make the caches of a shared-memory system as functionally invisible as the caches in a single-core system. Correct coherence ensures that a programmer cannot determine whether and where a system has caches by analyzing the results of loads and stores. This is because correct coherence ensures that the caches never enable new or different <strong><em>functional</em></strong> behavior (programmers may still be able to infer likely cache structure using <strong><em>timing</em></strong> information). The main purpose of cache coherence protocols is maintaining the single-writer-multiple-readers (SWMR) invariant for every memory location.\n  An important distinction between coherence and consistency is that coherence is specified on a <strong><em>per-memory location basis</em></strong>, whereas consistency is specified with respect to <strong><em>all</em></strong> memory locations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Continuing with our mental picture, the SWMR invariant corresponds to the physical requirement that there be at most one particle located at any one location but there can be an unlimited number of observers of any location.</p>\n", "title": "C++11 introduced a standardized memory model.

You can <a href=\"http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/v1.7.9/git-credential-cache.html#_examples\">set a longer timeout</a> with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper \"cache --timeout=3600\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(That example was suggested in the <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux\">GitHub help page for Linux</a>.) You can also store your credentials permanently if so desired, see the other answers below.</p>\n\n<p>GitHub's help <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-mac\">also suggests</a> that if you're on Mac OS X and used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_%28package_management_software%29\">Homebrew</a> to install Git, you can use the native Mac OS X keystore with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For Windows, there is a helper called <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows\">Git Credential Manager for Windows</a> or <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11693074/git-credential-cache-is-not-a-git-command\">wincred in msysgit</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global credential.helper wincred\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For Linux, you can <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13385690/how-to-use-git-with-gnome-keyring-integration\">use <code>gnome-keyring</code></a>(or other keyring implementation such as KWallet).</p>\n\n<h3>With Git versions before 1.7.9</h3>\n\n<p>With versions of Git before 1.7.9, this more secure option is not available, and you'll need to change the URL that your <code>origin</code> remote uses to include the password in this fashion:</p>\n\n<pre><code>https://you:password@github.com/you/example.git\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... in other words with <code>:password</code> after the username and before the <code>@</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You can set a new URL for your <code>origin</code> remote with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config remote.origin.url https://you:password@github.com/you/example.git\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Make sure that you use <code>https</code> and you should be aware that if you do this, your GitHub password will be stored in plaintext in your <code>.git</code> directory, which is obviously undesirable.</p>\n\n<h3>With any Git version (well, since version 0.99)</h3>\n\n<p>An alternative approach is to put your username and password in your <code>~/.netrc</code> file, although, as with keeping the password in the remote URL, this means that your password will be stored on the disk in plain text and is thus less secure and not recommended. However, if you want to take this approach, add the following line to your <code>~/.netrc</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>machine &lt;hostname&gt; login &lt;username&gt; password &lt;password&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>... replacing <code>&lt;hostname&gt;</code> with the server's hostname, and <code>&lt;username&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;password&gt;</code> with your username and password. Also remember to set restrictive file system permissions on that file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>chmod 600 ~/.netrc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that on Windows, this file should be called <code>_netrc</code>, and you may need to define the %HOME% environment variable - for more details see:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6031214/git-how-to-use-netrc-file-on-windows-to-save-user-and-password\">Git - How to use .netrc file on windows to save user and password</a></em></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Is there a way to skip password typing when using https:// on GitHub?", "answer_id": 5343146, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-skip-password-typing-when-using-https-on-github/5343146#5343146", "tags": ["git", "authentication", "github"]}, {"body": "<p>If you don't want to store your password in plaintext like Mark said, you can use a different github URL for fetching than you do for pushing.

I checked <a href=\"https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95472?hl=en\">the Chrome documentation for managing pop-ups</a>, but it didn't mention anything about that sort of thing.</p>\n\n<p>Also, <strong>once again, different browsers seem to implement the behavior of</strong> <code>window.open</code> <strong>differently.</strong> In Chrome and Firefox, <strong><em>specifying a width and height will force a popup,</em></strong> even when a user has set Firefox (29) to open new windows in a new tab (as mentioned in the answers to <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/726761/456814\">JavaScript open in a new window, not tab</a>):</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;button onclick=\"window.open('http://stackoverflow.com/q/4907843/456814', 'test', 'width=400, height=400');\"&gt;\n    &lt;code&gt;window.open(url)&lt;/code&gt;\n  &lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, the same code snippet above <strong>will always open a new tab in IE 11 if users set tabs as their browser preferences,</strong> not even specifying a width and height will force a new window popup for them.</p>\n\n<p>So the behavior of <code>window.open</code> in Chrome seems to be to open popups in a new tab when used in an <code>onclick</code> event, to open them in new windows when used from the browser console (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4907843/open-a-url-in-a-new-tab-using-javascript#comment22514382_13158856\">as noted by other people</a>), and to open them in new windows when specified with a width and a height.</p>\n\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Different browsers implement the behavior of</strong> <code>window.open</code> <strong>differently with regard to users' browser preferences.</strong> You cannot expect the same behavior for <code>window.open</code> to be true across all of Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, because of the different ways in which they handle a user's browser preferences.</p>\n\n<h1>Additional Reading</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.open\"><code>window.open</code> documentation</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Open a URL in a new tab (and not a new window) using JavaScript", "answer_id": 23415303, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4907843/open-a-url-in-a-new-tab-and-not-a-new-window-using-javascript/23415303#23415303", "tags": ["javascript"]}, {"body": "<p>I'm going to agree somewhat with the person who wrote (paraphrased here): \"For a link in an existing web page, the browser will always open the link in a new tab if the new page is part of the same web site as the existing web page.\"  For me, at least, this \"general rule\" works in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE, Safari, SeaMonkey, and Konqueror.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, there is a less complicated way to take advantage of what the other person presented.

In fact, by specifying <code>FILL_PARENT</code>, the <code>View</code> is requesting to be as big as its parent. Thus, (as explained by Romain Guy himself in this video at around 10:56) the constant was renamed <code>MATCH_PARENT</code> to clarify its use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Okay, I get how <code>FILL_PARENT/MATCH_PARENT</code> works. What does it matter if I use one or the other?</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>FILL_PARENT</code> is deprecated. Being deprecated does not make it the Devil, but eventually it will go away. Your application is more future-proof using <code>MATCH_PARENT</code>. Why use the deprecated option when the current option behaves exactly the same?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, <code>FILL_PARENT</code> is actually misleading. I have personally seen folks confused because it does not work the way they thought it would. In fact, I have seen a single tag using both <code>FILL_PARENT</code> and <code>MATCH_PARENT</code>, because the developer thought (understandably) that they were two different layout modes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN GET TRIPPED UP TRYING TO <code>FILL_PARENT</code>?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick example of how <code>MATCH_PARENT/FILL_PARENT</code> confusion can lead to folks repeatedly applying their heads to their desks.

Leave it for people who's job it is to maintain these libraries. If you need to make a decision, you're doing it wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, just use a library. Several exist depending on your requirements.</p>\n\n<h1>Libraries</h1>\n\n<p>Here is a breakdown of some of the more common APIs.</p>\n\n<h2>PHP 5.5 API - (Available for 5.3.7+)</h2>\n\n<p>Starting in PHP 5.5, a new API for hashing passwords is being introduced. There is also a shim compatibility library maintained (by me) for 5.3.7+. This has the benefit of being a peer-reviewed and <em>simple</em> to use implementation.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function register($username, $password) {\n    $hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);\n    save($user, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    if (password_verify($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Really, it's aimed to be extremely simple.</p>\n\n<p>Resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation: <a href=\"http://php.net/password\">on PHP.net</a></li>\n<li>Compatibility Library: <a href=\"https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat\">on GitHub</a></li>\n<li>PHP's RFC: <a href=\"http://wiki.php.net/rfc/password_hash\">on wiki.php.net</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt (5.3.2+)</h2>\n\n<p>This is another API that's similar to the PHP 5.5 one, and does a similar purpose. </p>\n\n<pre><code>function register($username, $password) {\n    $bcrypt = new Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt();\n    $hash = $bcrypt-&gt;create($password);\n    save($user, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    $bcrypt = new Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt();\n    if ($bcrypt-&gt;verify($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Resources:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Documentation: <a href=\"http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.0/en/modules/zend.crypt.password.html\">on Zend</a></li>\n<li>Blog Post: <a href=\"http://websec.io/2013/01/21/Password-Hashing-with-Zend-Crypt.html\">Password Hashing With Zend Crypt</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>PasswordLib</h2>\n\n<p>This is a slightly different approach to password hashing. Rather than simply supporting bcrypt, PasswordLib supports a large number of hashing algorithms. It's mainly useful in contexts where you need to support compatibility with legacy and disparate systems that may be outside of your control. It supports a large number of hashing algorithms. And is supported 5.3.2+</p>\n\n<pre><code>function register($username, $password) {\n    $lib = new PasswordLib\\PasswordLib();\n    $hash = $lib-&gt;createPasswordHash($password, '$2y$', array('cost' =&gt; 12));\n    save($user, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    $lib = new PasswordLib\\PasswordLib();\n    if ($lib-&gt;verifyPasswordHash($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Source Code / Documentation: <a href=\"https://github.com/ircmaxell/PHP-PasswordLib\">GitHub</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>PHPASS</h2>\n\n<p>This is a layer that does support bcrypt, but also supports a fairly strong algorithm that's useful if you do not have access to PHP >= 5.3.2... It actually supports PHP 3.0+ (although not with bcrypt).</p>\n\n<pre><code>function register($username, $password) {\n    $phpass = new PasswordHash(12, false);\n    $hash = $phpass-&gt;HashPassword($password);\n    save($user, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    $phpass = new PasswordHash(12, false);\n    if ($phpass-&gt;CheckPassword($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Resources</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Code: <a href=\"http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/projects/phpass/PasswordHash.php?rev=1.8;content-type=text%2Fplain\">cvsweb</a></li>\n<li>Project Site: <a href=\"http://www.openwall.com/phpass/\">on OpenWall</a></li>\n<li>A review of the &lt; 5.3.0 algorithm: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16042128/is-this-a-good-hashing-password-function-in-php-if-not-why/16044003#16044003\">on StackOverflow</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Don't use the PHPASS alternatives that are not hosted on openwall, they are different projects!!!</p>\n\n<h1>About BCrypt</h1>\n\n<p>If you notice, every one of these libraries returns a single string.

When the user decides to add a new row to the table, they tap some button and your controller creates a new (mutable) dictionary, adds it to the array. In order to fill in the row, the controller creates a detail view controller and gives it the new dictionary. The detail view controller fills in the dictionary and returns.

Some answers above mentioned storyboards and segues already but still relied on delegation.  Defining delegates certainly works but some people may find it easier to pass pointers or code blocks.</p>\n\n<p>With UINavigators and segues, there are easy ways of passing information to the subservient controller and getting the information back.  ARC makes passing pointers to things derived from NSObjects simple so if you want the subservient controller to add/change/modify some data for you, pass it a pointer to a mutable instance.  Blocks make passing actions easy so if you want the subservient controller to invoke an action on your higher level controller, pass it a block.  You define the block to accept any number of arguments that makes sense to you.  You can also design the API to use multiple blocks if that suits things better.</p>\n\n<p>Here are two trivial examples of the segue glue.

Here's a brief summary:</p>\n\n<h2>Shared data</h2>\n\n<p>One approach is to share pointers to the model objects between view controllers. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brute force iteration on view controllers (in Navigation or Tab Bar Controller) to set the data</li>\n<li>Set data in prepareForSegue (if storyboards) or init (if programmatic)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Since prepare for segue is the most common here is an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {\n    var next = segue.destinationViewController as NextViewController\n    next.dataSource = dataSource\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Independent access</h2>\n\n<p>Another approach is to handle a screen full of data at a time and instead of coupling the view controllers to each other couple each view controller to single data source that they can get to independently. </p>\n\n<p>The most common way I've seen this done is through a <a href=\"http://koreyhinton.com/blog/singleton-pattern-in-swift.html\">singleton</a> instance. So if your singleton object was <code>dataAccess</code> you could do the following in the viewDidLoad method of UIViewController:</p>\n\n<pre><code>func viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    var data = dataAccess.requestData()\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are addition tools that also help pass along data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Key-Value Observing</li>\n<li>NSNotification</li>\n<li>Core Data</li>\n<li>NSFetchedResultsController</li>\n<li>Data Source</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Core Data</h2>\n\n<p>The nice thing about Core Data is that it has inverse relationships. So if you want to just give a NotesViewController the notes object you can because it'll have an inverse relationship to something else like notebook. If you need data on the notebook in the NotesViewController you can walk back up the object graph by doing the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let notebookName = note.notebook.name\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Read more about this on my blog post: <a href=\"http://koreyhinton.com/blog/sharing-model-code.html\">Sharing Model Code</a></p>\n", "title": "Passing Data between View Controllers", "answer_id": 28221039, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5210535/passing-data-between-view-controllers/28221039#28221039", "tags": ["ios", "objective-c", "oop", "uitableview", "uiviewcontroller"]}, {"body": "<p>There is some good information in many of the answers given, but none address the question fully.</p>\n\n<p>The question asks about passing information between view controllers. The specific example given asks about passing information between views, but given the self-stated newness to iOS, the original poster likely meant between viewControllers, not between views (without any involvement from the ViewControllers). It seems that all the answers focus on two view controllers, but what if the app evolves to need to involve more than two view controllers in the information exchange? </p>\n\n<p>The original poster also asked about <strong>Singletons</strong> and the use of the <strong>AppDelegate</strong>. These questions need to be answered.</p>\n\n<p>To help anyone else looking at this question, who wants a full answer, I'm going to attempt to provide it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Application Scenarios</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rather than having a highly hypothetical, abstract discussion, it helps to have concrete applications in mind. To help define a two-view-controller situation and a more-than-two-view-controller situation, I am going to define two concrete application scenarios.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario one:</strong> maximum two view controllers ever need to share information.\nSee diagram one. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jtpRP.jpg\" alt=\"diagram of original problem\"></p>\n\n<p>There are two view controllers in the application. There is a ViewControllerA (Data Entry Form), and View Controller B (Product List). The items selected in the product list must match the items displayed in the text box in the data entry form. In this scenario, ViewControllerA and ViewControllerB must communicate directly with each other and no other view controllers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Scenario two</strong>: more than two view controllers need to share the same information.\nSee diagram two.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/o0Pw4.jpg\" alt=\"home inventory application diagram\"></p>\n\n<p>There are four view controllers in the application. It is a tab-based application for managing home inventory. Three view controllers present differently filtered views of the same data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ViewControllerA - Luxury Items </li>\n<li>ViewControllerB - Non-insured Items</li>\n<li>ViewControllerC - Entire Home Inventory </li>\n<li>ViewControllerD - Add New Item Form</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any time an individual item is created or edited, it must also synchronize with the other view controllers. For example, if we add a boat in ViewControllerD, but it is not yet insured, then the boat must appear when the user goes to ViewControllerA (Luxury Items), and also ViewControllerC (Entire Home Inventory), but not when the user goes to ViewControllerB (Non-insured Items). We need be concerned with not only adding new items, but also deleting items (which may be allowed from any of the four view controllers), or editing existing items (which may be allowed from the \"Add New Item Form\", repurposing the same for for editing).</p>\n\n<p>Since all the view controllers do need to share the same data, all four view controllers need to remain in synchronization, and therefore there needs to be some sort of communication to all other view controllers, whenever any single view controller changes the underlying data. It should be fairly obvious that we do not want each view controller communicating directly with each other view controller in this scenario. In case it is not obvious, consider if we had 20 different view controllers (rather than just 4). How difficult and error prone would it be to notify each of the other 19 view controllers any time one view controller made a change?</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Solutions: Delegates and the Observer Pattern, and Singletons</strong></p>\n\n<p>In scenario one, we have several viable solutions, as other answers have given</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>segues</li>\n<li>delegates</li>\n<li>setting properties on view controllers directly</li>\n<li>NSUserDefaults (actually a poor choice)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In scenario two, we have other viable solutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Observer Pattern </li>\n<li>Singletons</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A <strong>singleton</strong> is an instance of a class, that instance being the only instance in existence during its lifetime. A singleton gets its name from the fact that it is the single instance. Normally developers who use singletons have special class methods for accessing them. </p>\n\n<pre><code>+ (HouseholdInventoryManager*) sharedManager; {\n    static dispatch_once_t onceQueue;\n    static HouseholdInventoryManager* _sharedInstance;\n\n    // dispatch_once is guaranteed to only be executed once in the\n    // lifetime of the application\n    dispatch_once(&amp;onceQueue, ^{\n        _sharedInstance = [[self alloc] init];\n    });\n    return _sharedInstance;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now that we understand what a singleton is, let's discuss how a singleton fits into the observer pattern. The observer pattern is used for one object to respond to changes by another object. In the second scenario, we have four different view controllers, who all want to know about changes to the underlying data. The \"underlying data\" should belong to a single instance, a singleton. The \"know about changes\" is accomplished by observing changes made to the singleton.</p>\n\n<p>The home inventory application would have a single instance of a class which is designed to manage a list of inventory items. The manager would manage a collection of household items. The following is a class definition for the data manager:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;\n\n@class JGCHouseholdInventoryItem;\n\n@interface HouseholdInventoryManager : NSObject\n/*!\n The global singleton for accessing application data\n */\n+ (HouseholdInventoryManager*) sharedManager;\n\n\n- (NSArray *) entireHouseholdInventory;\n- (NSArray *) luxuryItems;\n- (NSArray *) nonInsuredItems;\n\n- (void) addHouseholdItemToHomeInventory:(JGCHouseholdInventoryItem*)item;\n- (void) editHouseholdItemInHomeInventory:(JGCHouseholdInventoryItem*)item;\n- (void) deleteHoueholdItemFromHomeInventory:(JGCHouseholdInventoryItem*)item;\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the collection of home inventory items changes, the view controllers need to be made aware of this change. The class definition above does not make it obvious how this will happen. We need to follow the observer pattern. The view controllers must formally observe the sharedManager. There are two ways to observe another object:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Key-Value-Observing (KVO)</li>\n<li>NSNotificationCenter.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In scenario two, we do not have a single property of the HouseholdInventoryManager which could be observed using KVO. Because we do not have a single property which is easily observable, the observer pattern in this case must be implemented using NSNotificationCenter. Each of the four view controllers would subscribe to notifications, and the sharedManager would send notifications to the notification center when appropriate. The inventory manager does not need to know anything about the view controllers or instances of any other classes which may be interested in knowing when the collection of inventory items changes; the NSNotificationCenter takes care of these implementation details. The View Controllers simply subscribe to notifications, and the data manager simply posts notifications.</p>\n\n<p>Many beginner programmers take advantage of the fact that there is always exactly one <strong>Application Delegate</strong> in the lifetime of the application, which is globally accessible. Beginning programmers use this fact to stuff objects and functionality into the appDelegate as a convenience for access from anywhere else in the application. Just because the AppDelegate is a singleton doesn't mean it should replace all other singletons. This is a poor practice as it places too much burden on one class, breaking good object oriented practices. Each class should have a clear role that is easily explained, often just by the name of the class.</p>\n\n<p>Any time your Application Delegate starts to get bloated, start to remove functionality into singletons. For example, the Core Data Stack should not be left in the AppDelegate, but should instead be put in its own class, a coreDataManager class. </p>\n\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ManagingDataFlowBetweenViewControllers/ManagingDataFlowBetweenViewControllers.html\">Managing Data Flow Between View Controllers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1591443959382526146#editor/target=post;postID=9190043611384073352;onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=0;src=postname\">Passing Data Between View Controllers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1591443959382526146#editor/target=post;postID=5973873796555751994;onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=1;src=postname\">Asynchronous JSON Requests in Objective-C</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Passing Data between View Controllers", "answer_id": 29462744, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5210535/passing-data-between-view-controllers/29462744#29462744", "tags": ["ios", "objective-c", "oop", "uitableview", "uiviewcontroller"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>Passing Data Forward</strong></p>\n\n<p>Passing data forward to a view controller from another view controller.

If you finish the full rebase operation, it will update your original branch with the cumulative result of the rebase operation and reattach HEAD to the original branch. My guess is that you never fully completed the rebase process; this will leave you with a detached HEAD pointing to the commit that was most recently processed by the rebase operation.</p>\n\n<p>To recover from your situation, you should create a branch that points to the commit currently pointed to by your detached HEAD:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git branch temp\ngit checkout temp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><sub>(these two commands can be abbreviated as <code>git checkout -b temp</code>)</sub></p>\n\n<p>This will reattach your HEAD to the new <code>temp</code> branch.</p>\n\n<p>Next, you should compare the current commit (and its history) with the normal branch on which you expected to be working:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit master origin/master temp\ngit diff master temp\ngit diff origin/master temp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(You will probably want to experiment with the log options: add <code>-p</code>, leave off <code>--pretty=\u2026</code> to see the whole log message, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>If your new <code>temp</code> branch looks good, you may want to update (e.g.) <code>master</code> to point to it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git branch -f master temp\ngit checkout master\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><sub>(these two commands can be abbreviated as <code>git checkout -B master temp</code>)</sub></p>\n\n<p>You can then delete the temporary branch:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git branch -d temp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Finally, you will probably want to push the reestablished history:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git push origin master\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You may need to use <code>--force</code> to push if the remote branch can not be \u201cfast-forwarded\u201d to the new commit (i.e. you dropped, or rewrote some existing commit, or otherwise rewrote some bit of history).</p>\n\n<p>If you were in the middle of a rebase operation you should probably clean it up. You can check whether a rebase was in process by looking for the directory <code>.git/rebase-merge/</code>. You can manually clean up the in-progress rebase by just deleting that directory (e.g. if you no longer remember the purpose and context of the active rebase operation). Usually you would use <code>git rebase --abort</code>, but that does some extra resetting that you probably want to avoid (it moves HEAD back to the original branch and resets it back to the original commit, which will undo some of the work we did above).</p>\n", "title": "How can I reconcile detached HEAD with master/origin?", "answer_id": 5772882, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5772192/how-can-i-reconcile-detached-head-with-master-origin/5772882#5772882", "tags": ["git"]}, {"body": "<h2>Get your detached commit onto its own branch</h2>\n\n<p>Simply run <code>git checkout -b mynewbranch</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Then run <code>git log</code>, and you'll see that commit is now <code>HEAD</code> on this new branch.</p>\n", "title": "How can I reconcile detached HEAD with master/origin?", "answer_id": 16641820, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5772192/how-can-i-reconcile-detached-head-with-master-origin/16641820#16641820", "tags": ["git"]}, {"body": "<p>I just ran into this issue and as soon as I read </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>HEAD is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>in the top-voted answer, I thought: \"Ah-ha!

These events carry a \"velocity\" number on keyboards that are velocity sensitive (\"touch sensitive\"), with a force of (you guessed it) between 0 and 127.</p>\n\n<p>Between velocity, chording, and the pedals, I'd think you could come up with quite a good \"typing\" interface for the piano keyboard. Chording in particular could be a very powerful technique&nbsp;&mdash; as I mentioned in the comments, it's why rank-and-file stenographers can use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype\">stenotype machine</a> to keep up with people talking for hours in a row, when even top-flight typists wouldn't be able to for any length of time via normal typewriter-style keyboards. As with machine stenography, you'd need a \"dictionary\" of the meanings of chords and sequences of chords. (Can you tell I used to work in the software side of machine stenography?)</p>\n\n<p>To do this, the fundamental pieces are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Receiving MIDI input. Don't try to do this yourself, use a library. <strong>Edit</strong>: Apparently, the Java Sound API <a href=\"http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/package-summary.html\">supports MIDI</a>, including receiving events from MIDI controllers. Cool. <a href=\"http://www.jsresources.org/faq_midi.html\">This page</a> may also be useful.</li>\n<li>Converting that data into the keystrokes you want to send, e.g. via the dictionary I mentioned above.</li>\n<li>Outputting the keystrokes to the computer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To be most broadly-compatible with software, you'd have to write this as a keyboard device driver. This is a plug-in to the operating system that serves as a source for keyboard events, talking to the underlying hardware (in your case, the piano keyboard). For Windows and Linux, you're probably going to want to use C for that.</p>\n\n<p>However, since you're just <em>generating</em> keystrokes (not trying to intercept them, which I was trying to do years ago), you may be able to use whatever features the operating system has for sending artificial keystrokes. Windows has an interface for doing that (probably several, the one I'm thinking of is <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646310%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\"><code>SendInput</code></a> but I know there's some \"journal\" interface that does something similar), and I'm sure other operating systems do as well. That may well be sufficient for your purposes&nbsp;&mdash; it's where I'd start, because the device driver route is going to be awkward and you'd probably have to use a different language for it than Java. (I'm a big fan of Java, but the interfaces that operating systems use to talk to device drivers tend to be more easily consumed via C and similar.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update</strong>: More about the \"dictionary\" of chords to keystrokes:</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the dictionary is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie\">trie</a> (thanks, @Adam) that we search with longest-prefix matching. Details:</p>\n\n<p>In machine stenography, the stenographer writes by pressing multiple keys on the stenotype machine at the same time, then releasing them all. They call this a \"stroke\" of the keyboard; it's like playing a chord on the piano. Strokes frequently (but not always) correspond to a syllable of spoken language. Like syllables, sometimes one stroke (chord) has meaning all on its own, other times it only has meaning combined with following strokes. (Think \"good\" vs. \"good\" followed by \"bye\"). Although they'll be heavily influenced by the school at which they studied, each stenographer will have their own \"dictionary\" of what strokes they use to mean what, a dictionary they will continuously hone over the course of their working lives. The dictionary will have entries where the stenographic part (\"steno\", for short) is one stroke long, or multiple strokes long. Frequently, there will be several entries with the same starting stroke which are differentiated by their length and by the subsequent strokes. For instance (and I won't use real steno here, just placeholders), there may be these entries:</p>\n\n<pre>A     = alpha\nA/B   = alphabet\nA/B/C = alphabetic\nA/C   = air conditioning\nB     = bee\nB/C   = because\nC     = sea\nD     = dog\nD/D   = Dee Dee</pre>\n\n<p>(Those letters aren't meant to be musical notes, just abstract markers.)</p>\n\n<p>Note that <code>A</code> starts multiple entries, and also note that how you translate a <code>C</code> stroke depends on whether you've previously seen an <code>A</code>, a <code>B</code>, or you're starting fresh.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that (although not shown in the very small sample above), there may be multiple ways to \"play\" the same word or phrase, rather than just one. Stenographers do that to make it easier to flow from a preceding word to the next depending on hand position. There's an obvious analogy to music there, and you could use that to make your typing flow more akin to playing music, in order to both prevent this from negatively affecting your piano playing and to maximize the likelihood of this actually helping with the RSI.</p>\n\n<p>When translating steno into standard text, again we use a \"longest-prefix match\" search: The translation algorithm starts with the first stroke ever written, and looks for entries starting with that stroke. If there is only one entry, and it's one stroke long, then we can reliably say \"that's the entry to use\", output the corresponding text, and then start fresh with the next stroke. But more likely, that stroke starts multiple entries of varying lengths. So we look at the next stroke and see if there are entries that start with those two strokes in order; and so on until we get a match.</p>\n\n<p>So with the dictionary above, suppose we saw this sequence:</p>\n\n<pre>A C B B C A B C A B D</pre>\n\n<p>Here's how we'd translate it:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>A</code> is the start of three entries of varying lengths; look at next stroke: <code>C</code></li>\n<li><code>A/C</code> matches only one entry; output \"air conditioning\" and start fresh with next stroke: <code>B</code></li>\n<li><code>B</code> starts two entries; look at next stroke: <code>B</code></li>\n<li><code>B/B</code> doesn't start anything; take the longest previous match (<code>B</code>) and output that (\"bee\")</li>\n<li>Having output <code>B</code> = \"bee\", we still have a <code>B</code> stroke in our buffer. It starts two entries, so look at the next stroke: <code>C</code></li>\n<li><code>B/C</code> matches one entry; output \"because\" and start fresh with the next stroke: <code>A</code></li>\n<li><code>A</code> starts three entries; look at the next stroke: <code>B</code></li>\n<li><code>A/B</code> starts two entries; look at the next stroke: <code>C</code></li>\n<li><code>A/B/C</code> only matches one entry; output \"alphabetic\" and start fresh with the next stroke: <code>A</code></li>\n<li><code>A</code> starts three entries; look at next stroke: <code>B</code></li>\n<li><code>A/B</code> starts two entries; look at next stroke: <code>D</code></li>\n<li><code>A/B/D</code> doesn't match anything, so take the longest previous match (<code>A/B</code>) and use it to output \"alphabet\". That leaves us with <code>D</code> still in the buffer.</li>\n<li><code>D</code> starts two entries, so we would normally look at the next stroke&nbsp;&mdash; but we've processed all the strokes, so consider it in isolation. In isolation, it translates as \"dog\" so output that.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Aspects of the above to note:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have a buffer of strokes you've read but haven't translated yet.</li>\n<li>You always want to match the most strokes against a single entry that you can. <code>A/B</code> should be translated as \"alphabet\", not \"alpha\" and \"bee\".</li>\n<li>(Not shown above) You may well have sequences of strokes that you can't translate, because they don't match anything in the dictionary. (Steno people use the noun \"untranslate\" -- e.g., with our dictionary, the strokes <code>E</code> would be an \"untranslate\".)</li>\n<li>(Not shown above) Some theories of steno allow the same set of strokes to mean more than one thing, based on a broader context. Steno people call these \"conflicts\". You probably want to disallow them in your project, and in fact when steno used to be translated manually by the stenographer, conflicts were fine because they'd know just by where in the sentence they were what the right choice was, but with the rise of machine translation, conflict-free theories of steno arose specifically to avoid having to go through the resulting translated text and \"fix\" conflicts.</li>\n<li>Translating in real time (which you'd be doing) means that if you receive a partial match, you'll want to hold onto it while waiting for the next chord&nbsp;&mdash; but probably only up to a timeout, at which point you'd translate what you have in the buffer as best you can. (Or maybe you don't want a timeout; it's your call.)</li>\n<li>Probably best to have a stroke that says \"disregard the previous stroke\"</li>\n<li>Probably best to have a stroke that says \"completely clear the buffer without outputting anything\"</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Using a piano keyboard as a computer keyboard", "answer_id": 5928462, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5928061/using-a-piano-keyboard-as-a-computer-keyboard/5928462#5928462", "tags": ["keyboard", "midi"]}, {"body": "<p>A good library in .NET with full midi support (BASS), go to <a href=\"http://www.un4seen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.un4seen.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And for the other part, translating keyboard midi notes to keys and more, I would go for AutoItX, the ActiveX/COM and DLL interface to autoIt.

MIDI technology is fairly straight-forward once you grasp it, but it can be confusing at the outset.

It's an easy book to read and is very helpful.  </p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h2>Pure Data &amp; Max</h2>\n\n<p>In my experience developing interactive multimedia, there are two very similar programs I have encountered that facilitate connecting and mapping signals/inputs from any device.</p>\n\n<p>These are <a href=\"http://cycling74.com/products/maxmspjitter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Max</a> for a Mac environment and <a href=\"http://puredata.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pure Data</a> for a PC environment.

It natively supports QWERTY keyboards, joysticks and mouse macros.   </p>\n\n<p>However, I was able to find an implementation supporting the specific mapping you are looking for.

So if you wanted to add other hardware such as drum pedals or a joystick it would be a matter of adjusting the program that talks to the serial interface.</p>\n\n<p>Another take on the above is like some posted above to use an Arduino, but also include <a href=\"http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9947\" rel=\"nofollow\">USB Host Shield</a> from Sparkfun to handle USB based music keyboards.

Then you are covered for both types. Although, I still think the virtual serial port method is more flexible and would be easier to program in the long run.

See <em><a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open\">open()</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p>When you open with \"a\" mode, the write position will <strong>always</strong> be at the end of the file (an append). You can open with \"a+\" to allow reading, seek backwards and read (but all writes will still be at the end of the file!).</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test1','wb') as f:\n        f.write('test')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test1','ab') as f:\n        f.write('koko')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; with open('test1','rb') as f:\n        f.read()\n'testkoko'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Using 'a' is not the same as opening with 'w' and seeking to the end of the file - consider what might happen if another program opened the file and started writing between the seek and the write.

I've used it myself. Using read/write in \"binary\" mode isn't a problem. That just means that the file isn't interpreted as text by the file library and is unrelated to content-type returned in the response.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with your code is you're always returning a content-type of \"text/plain\". The above code does not return any content-type, but if you're just using it for HTML, CSS, and JS, a browser can infer those just fine. <strong>No content-type is better than a wrong one.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Normally the content-type is a configuration of your web server. So I'm sorry if this doesn't solve <em>your</em> problem, but it worked for me as a simple development server and thought it might help some other people. If you do need correct content-types in the response, you either need to explicitly define them as joeytwiddle has or use a library like Connect that has sensible defaults. The nice thing about this is that it's simple and self-contained (no dependencies).</p>\n\n<p>But I do feel your issue.

Just open any HTML file in Brackets, press \"<em>Live Preview</em>\" and it starts a static server and opens your browser at the page. The browser will **auto refresh whenever you edit and save the HTML file. This especially useful when testing adaptive web sites. Open your HTML page on multiple browsers/window sizes/devices. Save your HTML page and instantly see if your adaptive stuff is working as they <em>all</em> auto refresh.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PhoneGap Developers</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you're coding a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_in_mobile_devices#Hybrid_Mobile_Apps\">hybrid mobile app</a>, you may be interested to know that the <a href=\"http://phonegap.com/\">PhoneGap</a> team took this auto refresh concept on board with their new <a href=\"http://app.phonegap.com/\">PhoneGap App</a>. This is a generic mobile app that can load the HTML5 files from a server during development. This is a very slick trick since now you can skip the slow compile/deploy steps in your development cycle for hybrid mobile apps if you're changing JS/CSS/HTML files \u2014 which is what you're doing most of the time. They also provide the static NodeJS web server (run <code>phonegap serve</code>) that detects file changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PhoneGap + Sencha Touch Developers</strong></p>\n\n<p>I've now extensively adapted the PhoneGap static server &amp; PhoneGap Developer App for Sencha Touch &amp; jQuery Mobile developers. Check it out at <a href=\"https://github.com/tohagan/stlive\">Sencha Touch Live</a>. Supports --qr QR Codes and --localtunnel that  proxies your static server from your desktop computer to a URL outside your firewall! Tons of uses.

The <code>'display:none'</code> style just makes the list box look 'nice'.</p>\n\n<p>Note: Using an empty <code>value</code> attribute on the \"placeholder\" option allows validation (required attribute) to work around having the \"placeholder\", so if the option isn't changed but is required; the browser should prompt the user to choose an option from the list.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (July 2015):</strong></p>\n\n<p>This method is confirmed working in the following browsers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome - v.43.0.2357.132</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox - v.39.0</li>\n<li>Safari - v.8.0.7 (Placeholder is visible in dropdown but is not selectable)</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer - v.11 (Placeholder is visible in dropdown but is not selectable)</li>\n<li>Project Spartan - v.15.10130 (Placeholder is visible in dropdown but is not selectable)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Update (October 2015):</strong></p>\n\n<p>Removed the <code>style=\"display: none\"</code> in favour of HTML5 attribute <code>hidden</code> which has wide support. The <code>hidden</code> element has similar traits as <code>display: none</code> in Safari, IE, (Project Spartan needs checking) where the <code>option</code> is visible in dropdown but is not selectable.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update (January 2016):</strong></p>\n\n<p>When the <code>select</code> element is <code>required</code> it allows use of the <code>:invalid</code> CSS pseudo-class which allows you to style the <code>select</code> element when in it's \"placeholder\" state. <code>:invalid</code> works here because of the empty value in the placeholder <code>option</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Once a value has been set the <code>:invalid</code> pseudo-class will be dropped. You can optionally also use <code>:valid</code> if you so wish.</p>\n\n<p>Most browsers support this pseudo-class. IE10+. This works best with custom styled <code>select</code> elements; In some cases i.e. ( Mac in Chrome / Safari) you'll need to change the default appearance of the <code>select</code> box so that certain styles display i.e. <code>background-color</code>, <code>color</code>.

Isn't the memory of a local variable inaccessible outside its function?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You rent a hotel room. You put a book in the top drawer of the bedside table and go to sleep.  You check out the next morning, but \"forget\" to give back your key. You steal the key!</p>\n\n<p>A week later, you return to the hotel, do not check in, sneak into your old room with your stolen key, and look in the drawer. Your book is still there. Astonishing!</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can that be? Aren't the contents of a hotel room drawer inaccessible if you haven't rented the room?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Well, obviously that scenario can happen in the real world no problem. There is no mysterious force that causes your book to disappear when you are no longer authorized to be in the room. Nor is there a mysterious force that prevents you from entering a room with a stolen key.</p>\n\n<p>The hotel management is not <em>required</em> to remove your book. You didn't make a contract with them that said that if you leave stuff behind, they'll shred it for you. If you illegally re-enter your room with a stolen key to get it back, the hotel security staff is not <em>required</em> to catch you sneaking in. You didn't make a contract with them that said \"if I try to sneak back into my room later, you are required to stop me.\" Rather, you signed a contract with them that said \"I promise not to sneak back into my room later\", a contract which <em>you broke</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In this situation <strong>anything can happen</strong>. The book can be there -- you got lucky. Someone else's book can be there and yours could be in the hotel's furnace. Someone could be there right when you come in, tearing your book to pieces. The hotel could have removed the table and book entirely and replaced it with a wardrobe. The entire hotel could be just about to be torn down and replaced with a football stadium, and you are going to die in an explosion while you are sneaking around. </p>\n\n<p>You don't know what is going to happen; when you checked out of the hotel and stole a key to illegally use later, you gave up the right to live in a predictable, safe world because <em>you</em> chose to break the rules of the system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C++ is not a safe language</strong>. It will cheerfully allow you to break the rules of the system. If you try to do something illegal and foolish like going back into a room you're not authorized to be in and rummaging through a desk that might not even be there anymore, C++ is not going to stop you. Safer languages than C++ solve this problem by restricting your power -- by having much stricter control over keys, for example.</p>\n\n<h2>UPDATE</h2>\n\n<p>Holy goodness, this answer is getting a lot of attention. (I'm not sure why -- I considered it to be just a \"fun\" little analogy, but whatever.)</p>\n\n<p>I thought it might be germane to update this a bit with a few more technical thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Compilers are in the business of generating code which manages the storage of the data manipulated by that program. There are lots of different ways of generating code to manage memory, but over time two basic techniques have become entrenched. </p>\n\n<p>The first is to have some sort of \"long lived\" storage area where the \"lifetime\" of each byte in the storage -- that is, the period of time when it is validly associated with some program variable -- cannot be easily predicted ahead of time. The compiler generates calls into a \"heap manager\" that knows how to dynamically allocate storage when it is needed and reclaim it when it is no longer needed.</p>\n\n<p>The second is to have some sort of \"short lived\" storage area where the lifetime of each byte in the storage is well known, and, in particular, lifetimes of storages follow a \"nesting\" pattern. That is, the allocation of the longest-lived of the short-lived variables strictly overlaps the allocations of shorter-lived variables that come after it. </p>\n\n<p>Local variables follow the latter pattern; when a method is entered, its local variables come alive. When that method calls another method, the new method's local variables come alive. They'll be dead before the first method's local variables are dead.  The relative order of the beginnings and endings of lifetimes of storages associated with local variables can be worked out ahead of time.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, local variables are usually generated as storage on a \"stack\" data structure, because a stack has the property that the first thing pushed on it is going to be the last thing popped off. </p>\n\n<p>It's like the hotel decides to only rent out rooms sequentially, and you can't check out until everyone with a room number higher than you has checked out. </p>\n\n<p>So let's think about the stack. In many operating systems you get one stack per thread and the stack is allocated to be a certain fixed size. When you call a method, stuff is pushed onto the stack. If you then pass a pointer to the stack back out of your method, as the original poster does here, that's just a pointer to the middle of some entirely valid million-byte memory block. In our analogy, you check out of the hotel; when you do, you just checked out of the highest-numbered occupied room.  If no one else checks in after you, and you go back to your room illegally, all your stuff is guaranteed to still be there <em>in this particular hotel</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We use stacks for temporary stores because they are really cheap and easy. An implementation of C++ is not required to use a stack for storage of locals; it could use the heap. It doesn't, because that would make the program slower. </p>\n\n<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to leave the garbage you left on the stack untouched so that you can come back for it later illegally; it is perfectly legal for the compiler to generate code that turns back to zero everything in the \"room\" that you just vacated. It doesn't because again, that would be expensive.</p>\n\n<p>An implementation of C++ is not required to ensure that when the stack logically shrinks, the addresses that used to be valid are still mapped into memory. The implementation is allowed to tell the operating system \"we're done using this page of stack now. Until I say otherwise, issue an exception that destroys the process if anyone touches the previously-valid stack page\".  Again, implementations do not actually do that because it is slow and unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, implementations let you make mistakes and get away with it. Most of the time. Until one day something truly awful goes wrong and the process explodes.</p>\n\n<p>This is problematic. There are a lot of rules and it is very easy to break them accidentally. I certainly have many times. And worse, the problem often only surfaces when memory is detected to be corrupt billions of nanoseconds after the corruption happened, when it is very hard to figure out who messed it up.</p>\n\n<p>More memory-safe languages solve this problem by restricting your power. In \"normal\" C# there simply is no way to take the address of a local and return it or store it for later. You can take the address of a local, but the language is cleverly designed so that it is impossible to use it after the lifetime of the local ends. In order to take the address of a local and pass it back, you have to put the compiler in a special \"unsafe\" mode, <em>and</em> put the word \"unsafe\" in your program, to call attention to the fact that you are probably doing something dangerous that could be breaking the rules. </p>\n\n<p>For further reading:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What if C# did allow returning references?

Many of these articles are also germane to C++ programmers:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/tag/memory-management/\">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/tag/memory-management/</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Can a local variable&#39;s memory be accessed outside its scope?", "answer_id": 6445794, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope/6445794#6445794", "tags": ["c++", "memory-management", "local-variables", "dangling"]}, {"body": "<p>Your problem has nothing to do with <em>scope</em>. In the code you show, the function <code>main</code> does not see the names in the function <code>foo</code>, so you can't access <code>a</code> in foo directly with <em>this</em> name outside <code>foo</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The problem you are having is why the program doesn't signal an error when referencing illegal memory. This is because C++ standards does not specify a very clear boundary between illegal memory and legal memory. Referencing something in popped out stack sometimes causes error and sometimes not. It depends. Don't count on this behavior. Assume it will always result in error when you program, but assume it will never signal error when you debug.</p>\n", "title": "Can a local variable&#39;s memory be accessed outside its scope?", "answer_id": 6449426, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope/6449426#6449426", "tags": ["c++", "memory-management", "local-variables", "dangling"]}, {"body": "<p>What you're doing here is simply reading and writing to memory that <i>used to</i> be the address of <code>a</code>. Now that you're outside of <code>foo</code>, it's just a pointer to some random memory area. It just so happens that in your example, that memory area does exist and nothing else is using it at the moment. You don't break anything by continuing to use it, and nothing else has overwritten it yet. Therefore, the <code>5</code> is still there. In a real program, that memory would be re-used almost immediately and you'd break something by doing this (though the symptoms may not appear until much later!)</p>\n\n<p>When you return from <code>foo</code>, you tell the OS that you're no longer using that memory and it can be reassigned to something else. If you're lucky and it never does get reassigned, and the OS doesn't catch you using it again, then you'll get away with the lie. Chances are though you'll end up writing over whatever else ends up with that address.</p>\n\n<p>Now if you're wondering why the compiler doesn't complain, it's probably because <code>foo</code> got eliminated by optimization. It usually will warn you about this sort of thing. C assumes you know what you're doing though, and technically you haven't violated scope here (there's no reference to <code>a</code> itself outside of <code>foo</code>), only memory access rules, which only triggers a warning rather than an error.</p>\n\n<p>In short: this won't usually work, but sometimes will by chance.</p>\n", "title": "Can a local variable&#39;s memory be accessed outside its scope?", "answer_id": 6449811, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope/6449811#6449811", "tags": ["c++", "memory-management", "local-variables", "dangling"]}, {"body": "<p>It works because the stack has not been altered (yet) since a was put there. \nCall a few other functions (which are also calling other functions) before accessing <code>a</code> again and you will probably not be so lucky anymore... ;-)</p>\n", "title": "Can a local variable&#39;s memory be accessed outside its scope?", "answer_id": 6456670, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope/6456670#6456670", "tags": ["c++", "memory-management", "local-variables", "dangling"]}, {"body": "<p>The things with correct (?) console output can change dramatically if you use ::printf but not cout. \nYou can play around with debugger within below code (tested on x86, 32-bit, MSVisual Studio):</p>\n\n<pre><code>char* foo() \n{\n  char buf[10];\n  ::strcpy(buf, \"TEST\u201d);\n  return buf;\n}\n\nint main() \n{\n  char* s = foo();    //place breakpoint &amp; check 's' varialbe here\n  ::printf(\"%s\\n\", s); \n}\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Can a local variable&#39;s memory be accessed outside its scope?", "answer_id": 6469747, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441218/can-a-local-variables-memory-be-accessed-outside-its-scope/6469747#6469747", "tags": ["c++", "memory-management", "local-variables", "dangling"]}, {"body": "<p>You actually invoked undefined behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>Returning the address of a temporary works, but as temporaries are destroyed at the end of a function the results of accessing them will be undefined.</p>\n\n<p>So you did not modify <code>a</code> but rather the memory location where <code>a</code> once was.

If this is the case, than this behavior is completely fine, and people are just misunderstanding the standard.</p>\n\n<p>Or another cause could be cheeky compilers that don't follow the standard properly.

There's nothing wrong <em>per se</em> with creating objects using the <code>new</code> operator.  What there is some argument for is that you have to do so with some discipline: if you create an object you need to make sure it's going to be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way of doing that is to create the object in automatic storage, so C++ knows to destroy it when it goes out of scope:</p>\n\n<pre><code> {\n    File foo = File(\"foo.dat\");\n\n    // do things\n\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, observe that when you fall off that block after the end-brace, <code>foo</code> is out of scope.

Commonly, there is a corresponding region of memory for each: the stack and the heap.</p>\n\n<h3>Stack</h3>\n\n<p>The stack always allocates memory in a sequential fashion.  It can do so because it requires you to release the memory in the reverse order (First-In, Last-Out: FILO).  This is the memory allocation technique for local variables in many programming languages.  It is very, very fast because it requires minimal bookkeeping and the next address to allocate is implicit.</p>\n\n<p>In C++, this is called <em>automatic storage</em> because the storage is claimed automatically at the end of scope.  As soon as execution of current code block (delimited using <code>{}</code>) is completed, memory for all variables in that block is automatically collected.  This is also the moment where <em>destructors</em> are invoked to clean up resources.</p>\n\n<h3>Heap</h3>\n\n<p>The heap allows for a more flexible memory allocation mode.  Bookkeeping is more complex and allocation is slower.  Because there is no implicit release point, you must release the memory manually, using <code>delete</code> or <code>delete[]</code> (<code>free</code> in C).  However, the absence of an implicit release point is the key to the heap's flexibility.</p>\n\n<h3>Reasons to use dynamic allocation</h3>\n\n<p>Even if using the heap is slower and potentially leads to memory leaks or memory fragmentation, there are perfectly good use cases for dynamic allocation, as it's less limited.</p>\n\n<p>Two key reasons to use dynamic allocation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You don't know how much memory you need at compile time.  For instance, when reading a text file into a string, you usually don't know what size the file has, so you can't decide how much memory to allocate until you run the program.</p></li>\n<li><p>You want to allocate memory which will persist after leaving the current block.  For instance, you may want to write a function <code>string readfile(string path)</code> that returns the contents of a file.  In this case, even if the stack could hold the entire file contents, you could not return from a function and keep the allocated memory block.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Why dynamic allocation is often unnecessary</h3>\n\n<p>In C++ there's a neat construct called a <em>destructor</em>.  This mechanism allows you to manage resources by aligning the lifetime of the resource with the lifetime of a variable. This technique is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization\">RAII</a> and is the distinguishing point of C++. It \"wraps\" resources into objects.  <code>std::string</code> is a perfect example.  This snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main ( int argc, char* argv[] )\n{\n    std::string program(argv[0]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>actually allocates a variable amount of memory.  The <code>std::string</code> object allocates memory using the heap and releases it in its destructor.  In this case, you did <em>not</em> need to manually manage any resources and still got the benefits of dynamic memory allocation.</p>\n\n<p>In particular, it implies that in this snippet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main ( int argc, char* argv[] )\n{\n    std::string * program = new std::string(argv[0]);  // Bad!\n    delete program;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>there is unneeded dynamic memory allocation.  The program requires more typing (!) and introduces the risk of forgetting to deallocate the memory.  It does this with no apparent benefit.</p>\n\n<h3>Why you should use automatic storage as often as possible</h3>\n\n<p>Basically, the last paragraph sums it up.  Using automatic storage as often as possible makes your programs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>faster to type;</li>\n<li>faster when run;</li>\n<li>less prone to memory/resource leaks.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Bonus points</h3>\n\n<p>In the referenced question, there are additional concerns.  In particular, the following class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Line {\npublic:\n    Line();\n    ~Line();\n    std::string* mString;\n};\n\nLine::Line() {\n    mString = new std::string(\"foo_bar\");\n}\n\nLine::~Line() {\n    delete mString;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is actually a lot more risky to use than the following one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Line {\npublic:\n    Line();\n    std::string mString;\n};\n\nLine::Line() {\n    mString = \"foo_bar\";\n    // note: there is a cleaner way to write this.\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reason is that <code>std::string</code> properly defines a copy constructor.  Consider the following program:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int main ()\n{\n    Line l1;\n    Line l2 = l1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the original version, this program will likely crash, as it uses <code>delete</code> on the same string twice.  Using the modified version, each <code>Line</code> instance will own its own string <em>instance</em>, each with its own memory and both will be released at the end of the program.</p>\n\n<h3>Other notes</h3>\n\n<p>Extensive use of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization\">RAII</a> is considered a best practice in C++ because of all the reasons above.  However, there is an additional benefit which is not immediately obvious.  Basically, it's better than the sum of its parts.  The whole mechanism <em>composes</em>.  It scales.</p>\n\n<p>If you use the <code>Line</code> class as a building block:</p>\n\n<pre><code> class Table\n {\n      Line borders[4];\n };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then</p>\n\n<pre><code> int main ()\n {\n     Table table;\n }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>allocates four <code>std::string</code> instances, four <code>Line</code> instances, one <code>Table</code> instance and all the string's contents and <em>everything is freed automagically</em>.</p>\n", "title": "Why should C++ programmers minimize use of &#39;new&#39;?", "answer_id": 6500497, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6500313/why-should-c-programmers-minimize-use-of-new/6500497#6500497", "tags": ["c++", "memory-management", "new-operator", "c++-faq"]}, {"body": "<ul>\n<li>C++ doesn't employ any memory manager by its own.

It\u2019s called a custom font with zero-width spaces, which allows you to collapse the whitespace (added by the browser for inline elements when they're on separate lines) at the font level using a very tiny font. Once you declare the font, you just change the <code>font-family</code> on the container and back again on the children, and voila. Like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>@font-face{ \n    font-family: 'NoSpace';\n    src: url('../Fonts/zerowidthspaces.eot');\n    src: url('../Fonts/zerowidthspaces.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),\n         url('../Fonts/zerowidthspaces.woff') format('woff'),\n         url('../Fonts/zerowidthspaces.ttf') format('truetype'),\n         url('../Fonts/zerowidthspaces.svg#NoSpace') format('svg');\n}\n\nbody {\n    font-face: 'OpenSans', sans-serif;\n}\n\n.inline-container {\n    font-face: 'NoSpace';\n}\n\n.inline-container &gt; * {\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-face: 'OpenSans', sans-serif;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suit to taste. Here\u2019s a download to the font I just cooked up in font-forge and converted with FontSquirrel webfont generator. Took me all of 5 minutes. The css <code>@font-face</code> declaration is included: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8W6UmdG-DTVbThfWkI5M1NYRVE/edit?usp=sharing\">zipped zero-width space font</a>. It's in Google Drive so you'll need to click File > Download to save it to your computer.

It is a story about possible reasons why <code>Object[] toArray</code> wasn't changed to <code>T[] toArray</code> where generics ware introduced to Java.</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Why <code>String[] stockArr = (String[]) stock_list.toArray();</code> wont work?</h3>\n\n<p>In Java, <strong><em>generic type exists at compile-time only</em></strong>. At runtime information about generic type (like in your case <code>&lt;String&gt;</code>) is removed and replaced with <code>Object</code> type (take a look at <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">type erasure</a>). That is why at runtime <code>toArray()</code> have no idea about what precise type to use to create new array, so it uses <code>Object</code> as safest type, because each class extends Object so it can safely store instance of any class. </p>\n\n<h3>Now the problem is that you can't cast instance of <code>Object[]</code> to <code>String[]</code>.</h3>\n\n<p>Why? Take a look at this example (lets assume that <code>class B extends A</code>): </p>\n\n<pre><code>//B extends A\nA a = new A();\nB b = (B)a;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Although such code will compile, at runtime we will see thrown <code>ClassCastException</code> because instance held by reference <code>a</code> is not actually of type <code>B</code> (or its subtypes). Why is this problem (why this exception needs to be cast)? One of the reasons is that <code>B</code> could have new methods/fields which <code>A</code> doesn't, so it is possible that someone will try to use these new members via <code>b</code> reference even if held instance doesn't have (doesn't support) them. In other words we could end up trying to use data which doesn't exist, which could lead to many problems. So to prevent such situation JVM throws exception, and stop further potentially dangerous code.</p>\n\n<p>You could ask now \"So why aren't we stopped even earlier? Why code involving such casting is even compilable? Shouldn't compiler stop it?\". Answer is: no because compiler can't know for sure what is the actual type of instance held by <code>a</code> reference, and there is a chance that it will hold instance of class <code>B</code> which will support interface of <code>b</code> reference. Take a look at this example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>A a = new B(); \n      //  ^------ Here reference \"a\" holds instance of type B\nB b = (B)a;    // so now casting is safe, now JVM is sure that `b` reference can \n               // safely access all members of B class\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now lets go back to your arrays. As you see in question, we can't cast instance of <code>Object[]</code> array to more precise type <code>String[]</code> like</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object[] arr = new Object[] { \"ab\", \"cd\" };\nString[] arr2 = (String[]) arr;//ClassCastException will be thrown\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here problem is a little different. Now we are sure that <code>String[]</code> array will not have additional fields or methods because every array support only:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>[]</code> operator, </li>\n<li><code>length</code> filed, </li>\n<li>methods inherited from Object supertype, </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So it is <em>not</em> arrays interface which is making it impossible. Problem is that <strong><em><code>Object[]</code> array beside <code>Strings</code> can store any objects</em></strong> (for instance <code>Integers</code>) so it is possible that one beautiful day we will end up with trying to invoke method like <code>strArray[i].substring(1,3)</code> on instance of <code>Integer</code> which doesn't have such method. </p>\n\n<p>So to make <em>sure</em> that this situation will <em>never</em> happen, in Java array references can hold only</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>instances of array of same type as reference (reference <code>String[] strArr</code> can hold <code>String[]</code>)</li>\n<li>instances of array of subtype (<code>Object[]</code> can hold <code>String[]</code> because <code>String</code> is subtype of <code>Object</code>), </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>but can't hold </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>array of supertype of type of array from reference (<code>String[]</code> can't hold <code>Object[]</code>)</li>\n<li>array of type which is not related to type from reference (<code>Integer[]</code> can't hold <code>String[]</code>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other words something like this is OK</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object[] arr = new String[] { \"ab\", \"cd\" }; //OK - because\n               //  ^^^^^^^^                  `arr` holds array of subtype of Object (String)\nString[] arr2 = (String[]) arr; //OK - `arr2` reference will hold same array of same type as \n                                //     reference\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You could say that one way to resolve this problem is to find at runtime most common type between all list elements and create array of that type, but this wont work in situations where all elements of list will be of one type derived from generic one. Take a look</p>\n\n<pre><code>//B extends A\nList&lt;A&gt; elements = new ArrayList&lt;A&gt;();\nelements.add(new B());\nelements.add(new B());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>now most common type is <code>B</code>, not <code>A</code> so <code>toArray()</code> </p>\n\n<pre><code>A[] arr = elements.toArray();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>would return array of <code>B</code> class <code>new B[]</code>. Problem with this array is that while compiler would allow you to edit its content by adding <code>new A()</code> element to it, you would get <code>ArrayStoreException</code> because <code>B[]</code> array can hold only elements of class <code>B</code> or its subclass, to make sure that all elements will support interface of <code>B</code>, but instance of <code>A</code> may not have all methods/fields of <code>B</code>. So this solution is not perfect.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Best solution to this problem is explicitly tell what type of array <code>toArray()</code> should be returned by passing this type as method argument like </p>\n\n<pre><code>String[] arr = list.toArray(new String[list.size()]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<pre><code>String[] arr = list.toArray(new String[0]); //if size of array is smaller then list it will be automatically adjusted.\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Convert ArrayList&lt;String&gt; to String[] array", "answer_id": 17909134, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5374311/convert-arrayliststring-to-string-array/17909134#17909134", "tags": ["java", "arraylist"]}, {"body": "<p>The correct way to do this is:  </p>\n\n<pre><code>String[] stockArr = stock_list.toArray(new String[stock_list.size()]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'd like to add to the other great answers here and explain how you could have used the Javadocs to answer your question.</p>\n\n<p>The Javadoc for <code>toArray()</code> (no arguments) is <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/AbstractCollection.html#toArray%28%29\">here</a>. As you can see, this method returns an <code>Object[]</code> and <em>not</em> <code>String[]</code> which is an array of the runtime type of your list:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>public Object[] toArray()</code>   </p>\n  \n  <p>Returns an array containing all of the\n  elements in this collection. If the collection makes any guarantees as\n  to what order its elements are returned by its iterator, this method\n  must return the elements in the same order. The returned array will be\n  \"safe\" in that no references to it are maintained by the collection.\n  (In other words, this method must allocate a new array even if the\n  collection is backed by an Array). The caller is thus free to modify\n  the returned array.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right below that method, though, is <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/AbstractCollection.html#toArray%28T%5b%5d%29\">the Javadoc</a> for <code>toArray(T[] a)</code>. As you can see, this method returns a <code>T[]</code> where <code>T</code> is the type of the array you pass in. At first this seems like what you're looking for, but it's unclear exactly why you're passing in an array (are you adding to it, using it for just the type, etc). The documentation makes it clear that the purpose of the passed array is essentially to define the type of array to return (which is exactly your use case):  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>public &lt;T&gt; T[] toArray(T[] a)</code></p>\n  \n  <p>Returns an array containing all of the\n  elements in this collection; <strong>the runtime type of the returned array is\n  that of the specified array.</strong> If the collection fits in the specified\n  array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated\n  with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this\n  collection. If the collection fits in the specified array with room to\n  spare (i.e., the array has more elements than the collection), the\n  element in the array immediately following the end of the collection\n  is set to null. This is useful in determining the length of the\n  collection only if the caller knows that the collection does not\n  contain any null elements.)</p>\n  \n  <p>If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements\n  are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in\n  the same order.</p>\n  \n  <p>This implementation checks if the array is large enough to contain the\n  collection; if not, it allocates a new array of the correct size and\n  type (using reflection). Then, it iterates over the collection,\n  storing each object reference in the next consecutive element of the\n  array, starting with element 0.

Basically this means that by default the checker treats everyhing (instance variables, method parameters, generic types, etc) except local variables as if they have a @NonNull type by default.  Per the documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The NNEL default leads to the smallest number of explicit annotations in your code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can set a different default for a class or for a method if NNEL doesn't work for you.</p></li>\n<li><p>This framework allows you to use with <strong><em><a href=\"http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#backward-compatibility\">without creating a dependency on the framework</a></em></strong> by enclosing your annotations in a comment: e.g. <code>/*@Nullable*/</code>.  This is nice because you can annotate and check a library or shared code, but still be able to use that library/shared coded in another project that doesn't use the framework.  This is a nice feature.  I've grown accustom to using it, even though I tend to enable the Checker Framework on all my projects now. </p></li>\n<li><p>The framework has a way to <a href=\"http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/current/checkers-manual.html#annotating-libraries\">annotate APIs</a> you use that aren't already annotated for nullness by using stub files.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "Which @NotNull Java annotation should I use?", "answer_id": 4963706, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4963300/which-notnull-java-annotation-should-i-use/4963706#4963706", "tags": ["java", "nullpointerexception", "null", "annotations", "ide"]}, {"body": "<p>While waiting for this to be sorted out upstream (Java 8?), you could also just define your own project-local <code>@NotNull</code> and <code>@Nullable</code> annotations.

quickly alters multiple styles at once; enforces separation of concerns (isolating your CSS and JS from your HTML)</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> CSS must be pre-written, so the content of <code>:before</code> or <code>:after</code> isn't completely dynamic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>2) Add new styles directly to the document's stylesheet</h2>\n\n<p>It's possible to use JavaScript to add styles directly to the document stylesheet, including <code>:after</code> and <code>:before</code> styles. jQuery doesn't provide a convenient shortcut, but fortunately the JS isn't that complicated:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var str = \"bar\";\ndocument.styleSheets[0].addRule('p.special:before','content: \"'+str+'\";');\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var str = \"bar\";\r\ndocument.styleSheets[0].addRule('p.special:before', 'content: \"' + str + '\";');</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>p:before {\r\n  content: \"foo\";\r\n  color: red;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"special\"&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/add-rules-stylesheets\"><code>.addRule()</code> and the related <code>.insertRule()</code> methods</a> are fairly well-supported today. </p>\n\n<p>As a variation, you can also use jQuery to add an entirely new stylesheet to the document, but the necessary code isn't any cleaner:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var str = \"bar\";\n$('&lt;style&gt;p.special:before{content:\"'+str+'\"}&lt;/style&gt;').appendTo('head');\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var str = \"bar\";\r\n$('&lt;style&gt;p.special:before{content:\"' + str + '\"}&lt;/style&gt;').appendTo('head');</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>p:before {\r\n  content: \"foo\";\r\n  color: red;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"special\"&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>If we're talking about \"manipulating\" the values, not just adding to them, we can also <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/pseudo-element\"><em>read</em> the existing <code>:after</code> or <code>:before</code> styles</a> using a different approach:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var str = window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('p'), ':before') \n           .getPropertyValue('content');\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var str = window.getComputedStyle($('p')[0], ':before').getPropertyValue('content');\r\nconsole.log(str);\r\n\r\ndocument.styleSheets[0].addRule('p.special:before', 'content: \"' + str+str + '\";');</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>p:before {\r\n    content:\"foo\";\r\n    color: red;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=\"special\"&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>We can replace <code>document.querySelector('p')</code> with <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/get/\"><code>$('p')[0]</code></a> when using jQuery, for slightly shorter code.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> any string can be dynamically inserted into the style</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> original styles aren't altered, just overridden; repeated (ab)use can make the DOM grow arbitrarily large</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>3) Alter a different DOM attribute</h2>\n\n<p>You can also to <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr\">use <code>attr()</code> in your CSS</a> to read a particular DOM attribute. (<a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gencontent\">If a browser supports <code>:before</code>, it supports <code>attr()</code> as well.</a>) By combining this with <code>content:</code> in some carefully-prepared CSS, we can change the content (but <strong><em>not other properties,</em></strong> like margin or color) of <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> dynamically:</p>\n\n<pre><code>p:before {\n    content: attr(data-before);\n    color: red;\n    cursor: pointer;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>JS:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$('p').on('click', function () {\n    $(this).attr('data-before','bar');\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$('p').on('click', function () {\r\n    $(this).attr('data-before','bar');\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>p:before {\r\n    content: attr(data-before);\r\n    color: red;\r\n    cursor: pointer;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>This can be combined with the second technique if the CSS can't be prepared ahead of time:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var str = \"bar\";\n\ndocument.styleSheets[0].addRule('p:before', 'content: attr(data-before);');\n\n$('p').on('click', function () {\n    $(this).attr('data-before', str);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var str = \"bar\";\r\ndocument.styleSheets[0].addRule('p:before', 'content: attr(data-before) !important;');\r\n\r\n$('p').on('click', function() {\r\n  $(this).attr('data-before', str);\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-css lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>p:before {\r\n  content: \"foo\";\r\n  color: red;\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Doesn't create endless extra styles</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> <code>attr</code> in CSS can only apply to content strings, not URLs or RGB colors</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Selecting and manipulating CSS pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after using jQuery", "answer_id": 21709814, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5041494/selecting-and-manipulating-css-pseudo-elements-such-as-before-and-after-usin/21709814#21709814", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "html", "css", "pseudo-element"]}, {"body": "<p>Here is the HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"icon\"&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"play\"&gt;\n    ::before\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Computed style on 'before' was <code>content: \"VERIFY TO WATCH\";</code></p>\n\n<p>Here is my two lines of jQuery, which use the idea of adding an extra class to specifically reference this element and then appending a style tag (with an !important tag) to changes the CSS of the sudo-element's content value:</p>\n\n<p><code>$(\"span.play:eq(0)\").addClass('G');</code></p>\n\n<p><code>$('body').append(\"&lt;style&gt;.G:before{content:'NewText' !important}&lt;/style&gt;\");</code></p>\n", "title": "Selecting and manipulating CSS pseudo-elements such as ::before and ::after using jQuery", "answer_id": 22493225, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5041494/selecting-and-manipulating-css-pseudo-elements-such-as-before-and-after-usin/22493225#22493225", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "html", "css", "pseudo-element"]}, {"body": "<p>IF you want to to manipulate the ::before or ::after sudo elements entirely through CSS, you could do it JS.

My original answer is below.]</p>\n\n<p>I'm glad you asked about this, because it's definitely a common point of confusion for folks looking at Node.js. Here's my best shot at explaining it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Node.js itself offers an <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.2/api/all.html#hTTP\">http</a> module, whose <code>createServer</code> method returns an object that you can use to respond to HTTP requests. That object inherits the <code>http.Server</code> prototype.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://senchalabs.github.com/connect/\">Connect</a> also offers a <code>createServer</code> method, which returns an object that inherits an extended version of <code>http.Server</code>. Connect's extensions are mainly there to make it easy to plug in <a href=\"https://github.com/senchalabs/connect/wiki\">middleware</a>. That's why Connect describes itself as a \"middleware framework,\" and is often analogized to Ruby's Rack.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\">Express</a> does to Connect what Connect does to the http module: It offers a <code>createServer</code> method that extends Connect's <code>Server</code> prototype. So all of the functionality of Connect is there, <em>plus</em> view rendering and a handy DSL for describing routes. Ruby's Sinatra is a good analogy.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then there are other frameworks that go even further and extend Express! <a href=\"https://github.com/mauricemach/zappa\">Zappa</a>, for instance, which integrates support for CoffeeScript, server-side jQuery, and testing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here's a concrete example of what's meant by \"middleware\": Out of the box, none of the above serves static files for you. But just throw in <code>connect.static</code> (a middleware that comes with Connect), configured to point to a directory, and your server will provide access to the files in that directory. Note that Express provides Connect's middlewares also; <code>express.static</code> is the same as <code>connect.static</code>. (Both were known as <code>staticProvider</code> until recently.)</p>\n\n<p>My impression is that most \"real\" Node.js apps are being developed with Express these days; the features it adds are extremely useful, and all of the lower-level functionality is still there if you want it.</p>\n", "title": "What is Node.js&#39; Connect, Express and &quot;middleware&quot;?", "answer_id": 5290324, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5284340/what-is-node-js-connect-express-and-middleware/5290324#5290324", "tags": ["node.js", "middleware"]}, {"body": "<h2>node.js</h2>\n\n<p>Node.js is a javascript motor for the server side.<br>\nIn addition to all the js capabilities, it includes networking capabilities (like HTTP), and access to the file system.<br>\nThis is different from client-side js where the networking tasks are monopolized by the browser, and access to the file system is forbidden for security reasons.  </p>\n\n<h2>node.js as a web server: express</h2>\n\n<p>Something that runs in the server, understands HTTP and can access files sounds like a web server.

Connect is <em>just</em> a middleware framework, with a nice <code>use</code> function. <em>Express does not depend on Connect</em> (<a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/express/blob/311e83e591a149a7549bab543dfd126d3223f7fd/package.json#L49-L68\" rel=\"nofollow\">see package.json</a>).

I've read about the subject a lot, and here's my distillation; again, these are slightly wooly and others may disagree.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unit Tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>Tests the smallest unit of functionality, typically a method/function (e.g. given a class with a particular state, calling x method on the class should cause y to happen).  Unit tests should be focussed on one particular feature (e.g., calling the pop method when the stack is empty should throw an <code>InvalidOperationException</code>).  Everything it touches should be done in memory; this means that the test code <strong>and</strong> the code under test shouldn't:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Call out into (non-trivial) collaborators</li>\n<li>Access the network  </li>\n<li>Hit a database</li>\n<li>Use the file system</li>\n<li>Spin up a thread</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any kind of dependency that is slow / hard to understand / initialise / manipulate should be stubbed/mocked/whatevered using the appropriate techniques so you can focus on what the unit of code is doing, not what its dependencies do. </p>\n\n<p>In short, unit tests are as simple as possible, easy to debug, reliable (due to reduced external factors), fast to execute and help to prove that the smallest building blocks of your program function as intended before they're put together.  The caveat is that, although you can prove they work perfectly in isolation, the units of code may blow up when combined which brings us to ...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Integration Tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>Integration tests build on unit tests by combining the units of code and testing that the resulting combination functions correctly.  This can be either the innards of one system, or combining multiple systems together to do something useful.  Also, another thing that differentiates integration tests from unit tests is the environment.  Integration tests can and will use threads, access the database or do whatever is required to ensure that all of the code <strong>and</strong> the different environment changes will work correctly.  </p>\n\n<p>If you've built some serialization code and unit tested its innards without touching the disk, how do you know that it'll work when you are loading and saving to disk?  Maybe you forgot to flush and dispose filestreams.  Maybe your file permissions are incorrect and you've tested the innards using in memory streams.  The only way to find out for sure is to test it 'for real' using an environment that is closest to production.</p>\n\n<p>The main advantage is that they will find bugs that unit tests can't such as wiring bugs (e.g. an instance of class A unexpectedly receives a null instance of B) and environment bugs (it runs fine on my single-CPU machine, but my colleague's 4 core machine can't pass the tests).  The main disadvantage is that integration tests touch more code, are less reliable, failures are harder to diagnose and the tests are harder to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>Also, integration tests don't necessarily prove that a complete feature works.  The user may not care about the internal details of my programs, but I do!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Functional Tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>Functional tests check a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification.  Functional tests don't concern themselves with intermediate results or side-effects, just the result (they don't care that after doing x, object y has state z). They are written to test part of the specification such as, \"calling function Square(x) with the argument of 2 returns 4\". </p>\n\n<p><strong>Acceptance Tests</strong></p>\n\n<p>Acceptance testing seems to be split into two types:</p>\n\n<p>Standard acceptance testing involves performing tests on the full system (e.g. using your web page via a web browser) to see whether the application's functionality satisfies the specification. E.g. \"clicking a zoom icon should enlarge the document view by 25%.\" There is no real continuum of results, just a pass or fail outcome. </p>\n\n<p>The advantage is that the tests are described in plain English and ensures the software, as a whole, is feature complete.  The disadvantage is that you've moved another level up the testing pyramid. Acceptance tests touch mountains of code, so tracking down a failure can be tricky.  </p>\n\n<p>Also, in agile software development, user acceptance testing involves creating tests to mirror the user stories created by/for the software's customer during development.  If the tests pass, it means the software should meet the customer's requirements and the stories can be considered complete. An acceptance test suite is basically an executable specification written in a domain specific language that describes the tests in the language used by the users of the system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>They're all complementary.  Sometimes it's advantageous to focus on one type or to eschew them entirely.  The main difference for me is that some of the tests look at things from a programmer's perspective, whereas others use a customer/end user focus.</p>\n", "title": "What&#39;s the difference between unit, functional, acceptance, and integration tests?", "answer_id": 4904533, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4904096/whats-the-difference-between-unit-functional-acceptance-and-integration-test/4904533#4904533", "tags": ["testing", "terminology", "definition"]}, {"body": "<p>The important thing is that you know what those terms mean to your colleagues.

Many of these extensions may change the behavior of valid POSIX shell scripts, so by itself <code>bash</code> is not a valid POSIX shell. Rather, it is a dialect of the POSIX shell language.</p>\n\n<p><code>bash</code> supports a <code>--posix</code> switch, which makes it more POSIX-compliant. It also tries to mimic POSIX if invoked as <code>sh</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>sh = bash?</h1>\n\n<p>For a long time, <code>/bin/sh</code> used to point to <code>/bin/bash</code> on most GNU/Linux systems. As a result, it had almost become safe to ignore the difference between the two. But that started to change recently.</p>\n\n<p>Some popular examples of systems where <code>/bin/sh</code> does not point to <code>/bin/bash</code> (and on some of which <code>/bin/bash</code> may not even exist) are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Modern Debian and Ubuntu systems, which symlink <code>sh</code> to <code>dash</code> by default;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox\">Busybox</a>, which is usually run during the Linux system boot time as part of <code>initramfs</code>. It uses the <code>ash</code> shell implementation.</li>\n<li>BSDs, and in general any non-Linux systems. OpenBSD uses <code>pdksh</code>, a descendant of the Korn shell. FreeBSD's <code>sh</code> is a descendant of the original UNIX Bourne shell.  Solaris has its own <code>sh</code> which for a long time was not POSIX-compliant; a free implementation is available from the <a href=\"http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/sh.html\">Heirloom project</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1>Shebang line</h1>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it's up to you to decide which one to use, by writing the \u00abshebang\u00bb line.</p>\n\n<p>E.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/bin/sh\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will use <code>sh</code> (and whatever that happens to point to),</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will use <code>/bin/bash</code> if it's available (and fail with an error message if it's not). Of course, you can also specify another implementation, e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>#!/bin/dash\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Which one to use</h1>\n\n<p>For my own scripts, I prefer <code>sh</code> for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>it is standardized</li>\n<li>it is much simpler and easier to learn</li>\n<li>it is portable across POSIX systems \u2014 even if they happen not to have <code>bash</code>, they are required to have <code>sh</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are advantages to using <code>bash</code> as well. Its features make programming more convenient and similar to programming in other modern programming languages. These include things like scoped local variables and arrays.

The term <strong>macro processor means functionality where text and\n  symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>A Unix <strong>shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language.</strong>\n  As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the\n  rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow\n  these utilities to be combined. Files containing commands can be\n  created, and become commands themselves. These new commands have the\n  same status as system commands in directories such as /bin, allowing\n  users or groups to establish custom environments to automate their\n  common tasks.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive\n  mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing\n  non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.</p>\n  \n  <p>A shell allows execution of GNU commands, both synchronously and\n  asynchronously. The shell waits for synchronous commands to complete\n  before accepting more input; asynchronous commands continue to execute\n  in parallel with the shell while it reads and executes additional\n  commands. The redirection constructs permit fine-grained control of\n  the input and output of those commands. Moreover, the shell allows\n  control over the contents of commands\u2019 environments.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins)\n  implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via\n  separate utilities</strong>. <strong>For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot\n  be implemented outside of the shell</strong> because they directly manipulate\n  the shell itself. The history, getopts, kill, or pwd builtins, among\n  others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more\n  convenient to use as builtin commands. All of the shell builtins are\n  described in subsequent sections.</p>\n  \n  <p>While executing commands is essential, <strong>most of the power (and\n  complexity) of shells is due to their embedded programming languages.</strong>\n  Like any high-level language, the shell provides variables, flow\n  control constructs, quoting, and functions.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shells offer features geared specifically for interactive use rather\n  than to augment the programming language. These interactive features\n  include job control, command line editing, command history and\n  aliases. Each of these features is described in this manual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>BASH</strong> <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/What-is-Bash_003f.html#What-is-Bash_003f\" rel=\"nofollow\">gnu.org:</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU\n  operating system. The name is an acronym for the \u2018Bourne-Again SHell\u2019,\n  a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the\n  current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs\n  Research version of Unix.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features\n  from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a\n  conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of\n  the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers\n  functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming\n  use.</p>\n  \n  <p>While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a\n  version of csh, <strong>Bash is the default shell</strong>. Like other GNU software,\n  Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of\n  Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports\n  exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "Difference between sh and bash", "answer_id": 39307101, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5725296/difference-between-sh-and-bash/39307101#39307101", "tags": ["bash", "shell", "unix", "sh"]}], "question_id": 5725296}, {"body": "<p>I want to get a list of all the branches in a Git repository with the \"freshest\" branches at the top, where the \"freshest\" branch is the one that's been committed to most recently (and is, therefore, more likely to be one I want to pay attention to).</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way I can use Git to either (a) sort the list of branches by latest commit, or (b) get a list of branches together with each one's last-commit date, in some kind of machine-readable format?</p>\n\n<p>Worst case, I could always run <code>git branch</code> to get a list of all the branches, parse its output, and then <code>git log -n 1 branchname --format=format:%ci</code> for each one, to get each branch's commit date.

By itself, if you try to WScript.Echo() or alert() this value, you won't see anything. However, if you append a blank string to it then suddenly it'll appear:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var s;\nWScript.Echo(s);\nWScript.Echo(\"\" + s);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can declare a variable, set it to null, and the behavior is identical except that you'll see \"null\" printed out versus \"undefined\". This is a small difference indeed.</p>\n\n<p>You can even compare a variable that is undefined to null or vice versa, and the condition will be true:</p>\n\n<pre><code>undefined == null\nnull == undefined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>They are, however, considered to be two different types. While undefined is a type all to itself, null is considered to be a special object value. You can see this by using typeof() which returns a string representing the general type of a variable:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var a;\nWScript.Echo(typeof(a));\nvar b = null;\nWScript.Echo(typeof(b));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Running the above script will result in the following output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>undefined\nobject\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Regardless of their being different types, they will still act the same if you try to access a member of either one, e.g. that is to say they will throw an exception. With WSH you will see the dreaded \"'varname' is null or not an object\" and that's if you're lucky (but that's a topic for another article).</p>\n\n<p>You can explicitely set a variable to be undefined, but I highly advise against it. I recommend only setting variables to null and leave undefined the value for things you forgot to set. At the same time, I really encourage you to always set every variable. JavaScript has a scope chain different than that of C-style languages, easily confusing even veteran programmers, and setting variables to null is the best way to prevent bugs based on it.</p>\n\n<p>Another instance where you will see undefined pop up is when using the delete operator. Those of us from a C-world might incorrectly interpret this as destroying an object, but it is not so. What this operation does is remove a subscript from an Array or a member from an Object. For Arrays it does not effect the length, but rather that subscript is now considered undefined.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var a = [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];\ndelete a[1];\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++)\nWScript.Echo((i+\".) \"+a[i]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The result of the above script is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0.) a\n1.) undefined\n2.) c\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You will also get undefined returned when reading a subscript or member that never existed.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between null and undefined is: JavaScript will never set anything to null, that's usually what we do. While we can set variables to undefined, we prefer null because it's not something that is ever done for us. When you're debugging this means that anything set to null is of your own doing and not JavaScript. Beyond that, these two special values are nearly equivalent.</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?", "answer_id": 5076989, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript/5076989#5076989", "tags": ["javascript", "null", "undefined"]}, {"body": "<p>Undefined means a variable has been declared but has no value:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var var1;\nalert(var1); //undefined\nalert(typeof var1); //undefined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Null is an assignment:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var var2= null;\nalert(var2); //null\nalert(typeof var2); //object\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?", "answer_id": 5076993, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript/5076993#5076993", "tags": ["javascript", "null", "undefined"]}, {"body": "<p><code>null</code> is a special value meaning \"no value\". <code>null</code> is a special object because <code>typeof null</code> returns 'object'.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <code>undefined</code> means that the variable has not been declared, or has not been given a value.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bloggingdeveloper.com/post/JavaScript-null-vs-undefined-The-Difference-between-null-and-undefined.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a>.</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?", "answer_id": 5077005, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript/5077005#5077005", "tags": ["javascript", "null", "undefined"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>null</strong>: absence of value for a variable; <strong>undefined</strong>: absence of variable itself;</p>\n\n<p><em>..where variable is a symbolic name associated with a value.</em></p>\n\n<p>JS could be kind enough to implicitly init newly declared variables with <strong>null</strong>, but it does not.</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?", "answer_id": 6563309, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript/6563309#6563309", "tags": ["javascript", "null", "undefined"]}, {"body": "<p>As typeof returns undefined, undefined is a type where as null is an initializer indicates the variable points to no object(virtually everything in Javascript is an object).</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?", "answer_id": 11822746, "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5076944/what-is-the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript/11822746#11822746", "tags": ["javascript", "null", "undefined"]}, {"body": "<p>null and undefined are both are used to represent the absence of some value.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var a = null;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>a is initialized and defined.</p>\n\n<pre><code>typeof(a)\n//object\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>null is an object in JavaScript</p>\n\n<pre><code>Object.prototype.toString.call(a) // [object Object]\n\nvar b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>b is undefined and uninitialized</p>\n\n<p>undefined object properties are also undefined.
