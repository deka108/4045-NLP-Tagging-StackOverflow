First question in my mind was: what is `PDO`?</h3>\n\n<p>A. \u201c<strong>PDO \u2013 PHP Data Objects</strong> \u2013 is a database access layer providing a uniform method of access to multiple databases.\u201d</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vd7ve.png\" alt=\"alt text\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Connecting to MySQL </h3>\n\n<p>With <code>mysql_*</code> function or we can say it the old way (deprecated in PHP 5.5 and above)</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'user', 'pass');\n    mysql_select_db('testdb', $link);\n    mysql_set_charset('UTF-8', $link);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With <code>PDO</code>: All you need to do is create a new <code>PDO</code> object. The constructor accepts parameters for specifying the database source <code>PDO</code>'s constructor mostly takes four parameters which are <code>DSN</code> (data source name) and  optionally <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Here I think you are familiar with all except <code>DSN</code>; this is new in <code>PDO</code>. A <code>DSN</code> is basically a string of options that tell <code>PDO</code> which driver to use, and connection details. For further reference, check <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.connection.php\">PDO MySQL DSN</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb;charset=utf8', 'username', 'password');\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can also use <code>charset=UTF-8</code>, but sometimes it causes an error, so it's better to use <code>utf8</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If there is any connection error, it will throw a <code>PDOException</code> object that can be cached to handle <code>Exception</code> further.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good read</strong>: <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.connections.php\">Connections and Connection management \u00b6</a> </p>\n\n<p>You can also pass in several driver options as an array to the fourth parameter. I recommend passing the parameter which puts <code>PDO</code> into exception mode. Because some <code>PDO</code> drivers don't support native prepared statements, so <code>PDO</code> performs emulation of the prepare. It also lets you manually enable this emulation. To use the native server-side prepared statements, you should explicitly set it <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The other is to turn off prepare emulation which is enabled in the <code>MySQL</code> driver by default, but prepare emulation should be turned off to use <code>PDO</code> safely. </p>\n\n<p>I will later explain why prepare emulation should be turned off. To find reason please check <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/12202218/1723893\">this post</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It is only usable if you are using an old version of <code>MySQL</code> which I do not recommended.</p>\n\n<p>Below is an example of how you can do it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb;charset=UTF-8', \n                  'username', \n                  'password',\n                  array(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES =&gt; false,\n                  PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE =&gt; PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Can we set attributes after PDO construction?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Yes</strong>, we can also set some attributes after PDO construction with the <code>setAttribute</code> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    $db = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=testdb;charset=UTF-8', \n                  'username', \n                  'password');\n                  $db-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);\n                  $db-&gt;setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES, false);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Error Handling </h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Error handling is much easier in <code>PDO</code> than <code>mysql_*</code>.</p>\n\n<p>A common practice when using <code>mysql_*</code> is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    //Connected to MySQL\n    $result = mysql_query(\"SELECT * FROM table\", $link) or die(mysql_error($link));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>OR die()</code> is not a good way to handle the error since we can not handle the thing in <code>die</code>. It will just end the script abruptly and then echo the error to the screen which you usually do NOT want to show to your end users, and let bloody hackers discover your schema. Alternately, the return values of <code>mysql_*</code> functions can often be used in conjunction with <a href=\"http://php.net/mysql_error\">mysql_error()</a> to handle errors.</p>\n\n<p><code>PDO</code> offers a better solution: exceptions. Anything we do with <code>PDO</code> should be wrapped in a <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> block. We can force <code>PDO</code> into one of three error modes by setting the error mode attribute. Three error handling modes are below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>PDO::ERRMODE_SILENT</code>. It's just setting error codes and acts pretty much the same as <code>mysql_*</code> where you must check each result and then look at <code>$db-&gt;errorInfo();</code> to get the error details.</li>\n<li><code>PDO::ERRMODE_WARNING</code> Raise <code>E_WARNING</code>. (Run-time warnings (non-fatal errors). Execution of the script is not halted.)</li>\n<li><code>PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION</code>: Throw exceptions. It represents an error raised by PDO. You should not throw a <code>PDOException</code> from your own code. See <em>Exceptions</em> for more information about exceptions in PHP. It acts very much like <code>or die(mysql_error());</code>, when it isn't caught. But unlike <code>or die()</code>, the <code>PDOException</code> can be caught and handled gracefully if you choose to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Good read</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.error-handling.php\">Errors and error handling \u00b6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/class.pdoexception.php\">The PDOException class \u00b6</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.exceptions.php\">Exceptions \u00b6</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$stmt-&gt;setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_SILENT );\n$stmt-&gt;setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_WARNING );\n$stmt-&gt;setAttribute( PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And you can wrap it in <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>, like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>try {\n    //Connect as appropriate as above\n    $db-&gt;query('hi'); //Invalid query!\n} \ncatch (PDOException $ex) {\n    echo \"An Error occured!\"; //User friendly message/message you want to show to user\n    some_logging_function($ex-&gt;getMessage());\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You do not have to handle with <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code> right now. You can catch it at any time appropriate, but I strongly recommend you to use <code>try</code>-<code>catch</code>. Also it may make more sense to catch it at outside the function that calls the <code>PDO</code> stuff:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    function data_fun($db) {\n       $stmt = $db-&gt;query(\"SELECT * FROM table\");\n       return $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n    }\n\n    //Then later\n    try {\n       data_fun($db);\n    }\n    catch(PDOException $ex) {\n       //Here you can handle error and show message/perform action you want.\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also, you can handle by <code>or die()</code> or we can say like <code>mysql_*</code>, but it will be really varied. You can hide the dangerous error messages in production by turning <code>display_errors off</code> and just reading your error log.</p>\n\n<p>Now, after reading all the things above, you are probably thinking: what the heck is that when I just want to start leaning simple <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, or <code>DELETE</code> statements? Don't worry, here we go:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Selecting Data</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AhIlC.png\" alt=\"PDO select image\"></p>\n\n<p>So what you are doing in <code>mysql_*</code> is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $result = mysql_query('SELECT * from table') or die(mysql_error());\n\n    $num_rows = mysql_num_rows($result);\n\n    while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        echo $row['field1'];\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now in <code>PDO</code>, you can do this like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $stmt = $db-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM table');\n\n    while($row = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {\n        echo $row['field1'];\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $stmt = $db-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM table');\n    $results = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n\n    //Use $results\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using the method like below (<code>query()</code>), this method returns a <code>PDOStatement</code> object. So if you want to fetch the result, use it like above.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    foreach($db-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM table') as $row) {\n        echo $row['field1'];\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In PDO Data, it is obtained via the <code>-&gt;fetch()</code>, a method of your statement handle. Before calling fetch, the best approach would be telling PDO how you\u2019d like the data to be fetched. In the below section I am explaining this.</p>\n\n<h2>Fetch Modes</h2>\n\n<p>Note the use of <code>PDO::FETCH_ASSOC</code> in the <code>fetch()</code> and <code>fetchAll()</code> code above. This tells <code>PDO</code> to return the rows as an associative array with the field names as keys. There are many other fetch modes too which I will explain one by one.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I explain how to select fetch mode:</p>\n\n<pre><code> $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above, I have been using <code>fetch()</code>. You can also use:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetchall.php\"><code>PDOStatement::fetchAll()</code></a> - Returns an array containing all of the result set rows</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetchcolumn.php\"><code>PDOStatement::fetchColumn()</code></a> - Returns a single column from the next row of a result set</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetchobject.php\"><code>PDOStatement::fetchObject()</code></a> - Fetches the next row and returns it as an object.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.setfetchmode.php\"><code>PDOStatement::setFetchMode()</code></a> - Set the default fetch mode for this statement</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now I come to fetch mode:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>PDO::FETCH_ASSOC</code>: returns an array indexed by column name as returned in your result set</li>\n<li><code>PDO::FETCH_BOTH</code> (default): returns an array indexed by both column name and 0-indexed column number as returned in your result set</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are even more choices! Read about them all in <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.fetch.php\"><code>PDOStatement</code> Fetch documentation.</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Getting the row count</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Instead of using <code>mysql_num_rows</code> to get the number of returned rows, you can get a <code>PDOStatement</code> and do <code>rowCount()</code>, like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $stmt = $db-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM table');\n    $row_count = $stmt-&gt;rowCount();\n    echo $row_count.' rows selected';\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Getting the Last Inserted ID</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $result = $db-&gt;exec(\"INSERT INTO table(firstname, lastname) VAULES('John', 'Doe')\");\n    $insertId = $db-&gt;lastInsertId();\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Insert and Update or Delete statements</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/yQhPC.png\" alt=\"Insert and update PDO image\"></p>\n\n<p>What we are doing in <code>mysql_*</code> function is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $results = mysql_query(\"UPDATE table SET field='value'\") or die(mysql_error());\n    echo mysql_affected_rows($result);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in pdo, this same thing can be done by:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $affected_rows = $db-&gt;exec(\"UPDATE table SET field='value'\");\n    echo $affected_rows;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above query <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.exec.php\"><code>PDO::exec</code></a> execute an SQL statement and returns the number of affected rows.</p>\n\n<p><sub><em>Insert and delete will be covered later.</em></sub></p>\n\n<p>The above method is only useful when you are not using variable in query. But when you need to use a variable in a query, do not ever ever try like the above and there for  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement\"><strong>prepared statement or parameterized statement</strong></a> is.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2><strong>Prepared Statements</strong></h2>\n\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> What is a prepared statement and why do I need them?<br>\n<strong>A.</strong> A prepared statement is a pre-compiled SQL statement that can be executed multiple times by sending only the data to the server.<br></p>\n\n<p>The typical workflow of using a prepared statement is as follows (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement\">quoted from Wikipedia three 3 point</a>):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Prepare</strong>: The statement template is created by the application and sent to the database management system (DBMS). Certain values are left unspecified, called parameters, placeholders or bind variables (labelled <code>?</code> below):</p>\n\n<p><code>INSERT INTO PRODUCT (name, price) VALUES (?, ?)</code></p></li>\n<li><p>The DBMS parses, compiles, and performs query optimization on the statement template, and stores the result without executing it.</p></li>\n<li><strong>Execute</strong>: At a later time, the application supplies (or binds) values for the parameters, and the DBMS executes the statement (possibly returning a result). The application may execute the statement as many times as it wants with different values. In this example, it might supply 'Bread' for the first parameter and <code>1.00</code> for the second parameter.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You can use a prepared statement by including placeholders in your SQL. There are basically three ones without placeholders (don't try this with variable its above one), one with unnamed placeholders, and one with named placeholders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> So now, what are named placeholders and how do I use them?<br>\n<strong>A.</strong> Named placeholders. Use descriptive names preceded by a colon, instead of question marks. We don't care about position/order of value in name place holder:</p>\n\n<pre><code> $stmt-&gt;bindParam(':bla', $bla);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.bindparam.php\"><code>bindParam(parameter,variable,data_type,length,driver_options)</code></a></p>\n\n<p>You can also bind using an execute array as well:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"SELECT * FROM table WHERE id=:id AND name=:name\");\n    $stmt-&gt;execute(array(':name' =&gt; $name, ':id' =&gt; $id));\n    $rows = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another nice feature for <code>OOP</code> friends is that named placeholders have the ability to insert objects directly into your database, assuming the properties match the named fields. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class person {\n    public $name;\n    public $add;\n    function __construct($a,$b) {\n        $this-&gt;name = $a;\n        $this-&gt;add = $b;\n    }\n\n}\n$demo = new person('john','29 bla district');\n$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"INSERT INTO table (name, add) value (:name, :add)\");\n$stmt-&gt;execute((array)$demo);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Q.</strong> So now, what are unnamed placeholders and how do I use them?<br>\n<strong>A.</strong> Let's have an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n    $stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"INSERT INTO folks (name, add) values (?, ?)\");\n    $stmt-&gt;bindValue(1, $name, PDO::PARAM_STR);\n    $stmt-&gt;bindValue(2, $add, PDO::PARAM_STR);\n    $stmt-&gt;execute();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<pre><code> $stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"INSERT INTO folks (name, add) values (?, ?)\");\n $stmt-&gt;execute(array('john', '29 bla district'));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above, you can see those <code>?</code> instead of a name like in a name place holder. Now in the first example, we assign variables to the various placeholders (<code>$stmt-&gt;bindValue(1, $name, PDO::PARAM_STR);</code>). Then, we assign values to those placeholders and execute the statement. In the second example, the first array element goes to the first <code>?</code> and the second to the second <code>?</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: In <strong>unnamed placeholders</strong> we must take care of the proper order of the elements in the array that we are passing to the <code>PDOStatement::execute()</code> method.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2><code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code> prepared queries</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><code>SELECT</code></strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"SELECT * FROM table WHERE id=:id AND name=:name\");\n$stmt-&gt;execute(array(':name' =&gt; $name, ':id' =&gt; $id));\n$rows = $stmt-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong><code>INSERT</code></strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"INSERT INTO table(field1,field2) VALUES(:field1,:field2)\");\n$stmt-&gt;execute(array(':field1' =&gt; $field1, ':field2' =&gt; $field2));\n$affected_rows = $stmt-&gt;rowCount();\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong><code>DELETE</code></strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"DELETE FROM table WHERE id=:id\");\n$stmt-&gt;bindValue(':id', $id, PDO::PARAM_STR);\n$stmt-&gt;execute();\n$affected_rows = $stmt-&gt;rowCount();\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong><code>UPDATE</code></strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$stmt = $db-&gt;prepare(\"UPDATE table SET name=?

Just because of all these numerous tutorials and manuals which teach you wrong way. Not the functions themselves - I have to emphasize it - but the way they are used.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This latter issue is a problem.<br>\nBut, to my opinion, proposed solution is no better either.<br>\nIt seems to me <strong>too idealistic</strong> a dream that all those PHP users will learn how to handle SQL queries properly at once. Most likely they would just change mysql_* to mysqli_* mechanically, <strong>leaving the approach the same</strong>. Especially because mysqli makes prepared statements usage incredible painful and troublesome.<br>\nNot to mention that <em>native</em> prepared statements <strong>aren't enough to protect</strong> from SQL injections, and neither mysqli nor PDO offers a solution. </p>\n\n<p>So, instead of fighting this honest extension, I'd prefer to fight wrong practices and educate people in the right ways. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Also, there are some false or non-significant reasons, like</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn't support Stored Procedures (we were using <code>mysql_query(\"CALL my_proc\");</code> for ages)</li>\n<li>Doesn't support Transactions (same as above)</li>\n<li>Doesn't support Multiple Statements (who need them?)</li>\n<li>Not under active development (so what? does it affect <em>you</em> in any practical way?)</li>\n<li>Lacks an OO interface (to create one is a matter of several hours)</li>\n<li>Doesn't support Prepared Statements or Parametrized Queries</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A latter one is an interesting point. Although mysql ext do not support <em>native</em> prepared statements, they aren't required for the safety. We can easily fake prepared statements using manually handled placeholders (just like PDO does):</p>\n\n<pre><code>function paraQuery()\n{\n    $args  = func_get_args();\n    $query = array_shift($args);\n    $query = str_replace(\"%s\",\"'%s'\",$query); \n\n    foreach ($args as $key =&gt; $val)\n    {\n        $args[$key] = mysql_real_escape_string($val);\n    }\n\n    $query  = vsprintf($query, $args);\n    $result = mysql_query($query);\n    if (!$result)\n    {\n        throw new Exception(mysql_error().\" [$query]\");\n    }\n    return $result;\n}\n\n$query  = \"SELECT * FROM table where a=%s AND b LIKE %s LIMIT %d\";\n$result = paraQuery($query, $a, \"%$b%\", $limit);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>voila</em>, everything is parameterized and safe.</p>\n\n<p>But okay, if you don't like the red box in the manual, a problem of choice arises: mysqli or PDO?</p>\n\n<p>Well, the answer would be as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you understand the necessity of using a <em>database abstraction layer</em>, and looking for an API to create one, <strong>mysqli</strong> is a very good choice, as it indeed supports many mysql-specific features.</li>\n<li><p>If, like wast majority of PHP folks, you are using raw API calls right in the application code (which is essentially wrong practice) - <strong>PDO is the only choice</strong>, as this extension pretends to be not just API but rather a semi-DAL, still incomplete but offers many important features, with two of them makes PDO critically distinguished from mysqli:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>unlike mysqli, PDO can bind placeholders <em>by value</em>, which makes dynamically built queries feasible without several screens of quite messy code.</li>\n<li>unlike mysqli, PDO can always return query result in a simple usual array, while mysqli can do it only on mysqlnd installations.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, if you are an average PHP user and want to save yourself a ton of headaches when using native prepared statements, PDO - again - is the only choice.<br>\nHowever, PDO is not a silver bullet too, and has it's hardships.<br>\nSo, I wrote solutions for all the common pitfalls and complex cases in the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/pdo/info\"><strong>PDO tag wiki</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, everyone talking of extensions always missing the <strong>2 important facts</strong> about Mysqli and PDO:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Prepared statement <strong>isn't a silver bullet</strong>. There are dynamical identifiers which cannot be bound using prepared statements. There are dynamical queries with unknown number of parameters which makes query building a difficult task.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Neither mysqli_* nor PDO functions should be appeared in the application code.</strong><br>\nThere ought to be an <strong>abstraction layer</strong> between them and application code, which will do all the dirty job of binding, looping, error handling, etc. inside, making application code DRY and clean. Especially for the complex cases like dynamical query building.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, just switching to PDO or mysqli is not enough. One have to use an ORM, or a query builder, or whatever database abstraction class instead of calling raw API functions in their code.<br>\nAnd contrary - if you have an abstraction layer between your application code and mysql API - <strong>it doesn't actually matter which engine is used.</strong> You can use mysql ext until it goes deprecated and then easily rewrite your abstraction class to another engine, <strong>having all the application code intact.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are some examples based on my <a href=\"https://github.com/colshrapnel/safemysql/blob/master/safemysql.class.php\">safemysql class</a> to show how such an abstraction class ought to be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$city_ids = array(1,2,3);\n$cities   = $db-&gt;getCol(\"SELECT name FROM cities WHERE is IN(?a)\", $city_ids);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Compare this one single line with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/15991146/285587\">amount of code you will need with PDO</a>.<br>\nThen compare with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/17874410/285587\">crazy amount of code</a> you will need with raw Mysqli prepared statements.\nNote that error handling, profiling, query logging already built in and running.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$insert = array('name' =&gt; 'John', 'surname' =&gt; \"O'Hara\");\n$db-&gt;query(\"INSERT INTO users SET ?u\", $insert);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Compare it with usual PDO inserts, when every single field name being repeated six to ten times - in all these numerous named placeholders, bindings and query definitions.</p>\n\n<p>Another example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$data = $db-&gt;getAll(\"SELECT * FROM goods ORDER BY ?n\", $_GET['order']);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can hardly find an example for PDO to handle such practical case.<br>\nAnd it will be too wordy and most likely unsafe.    </p>\n\n<p>So, once more - it is not just raw driver should be your concern but abstraction class, useful not only for silly examples from beginner's manual but to solve whatever real life problems. </p>\n", "title": "Why shouldn&#39;t I use mysql_* functions in PHP?", "tags": ["php", "mysql", "database", "mysqli", "pdo"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12859942/why-shouldnt-i-use-mysql-functions-in-php/14112684#14112684", "question_id": 12859942, "answer_id": 14112684}, {"body": "<p>This answer is written to show just how trivial it is to bypass poorly written PHP user-validation code, how (and using what) these attacks work and how to replace the old MySQL functions with a secure prepared statement - and basically, why StackOverflow users (probably with a lot of rep) are barking at new users asking questions to improve their code.</p>\n\n<p>First off, please feel free to create this test mysql database (I have called mine prep):</p>\n\n<pre><code>mysql&gt; create table users(\n    -&gt; id int(2) primary key auto_increment,\n    -&gt; userid tinytext,\n    -&gt; pass tinytext);\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)\n\nmysql&gt; insert into users values(null, 'Fluffeh', 'mypass');\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.04 sec)\n\nmysql&gt; create user 'prepared'@'localhost' identified by 'example';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql&gt; grant all privileges on prep.* to 'prepared'@'localhost' with grant option;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With that done, we can move to our PHP code.</p>\n\n<p>Lets assume the following script is the verification process for an admin on a website (simplified but working if you copy and use it for testing):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php \n\n    if(!empty($_POST['user']))\n    {\n        $user=$_POST['user'];\n    }   \n    else\n    {\n        $user='bob';\n    }\n    if(!empty($_POST['pass']))\n    {\n        $pass=$_POST['pass'];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        $pass='bob';\n    }\n\n    $database='prep';\n    $link=mysql_connect('localhost', 'prepared', 'example');\n    mysql_select_db($database) or die( \"Unable to select database\");\n\n    $sql=\"select id, userid, pass from users where userid='$user' and pass='$pass'\";\n    //echo $sql.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\";\n    $result=mysql_query($sql);\n    $isAdmin=false;\n    while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n        echo \"My id is \".$row['id'].\" and my username is \".$row['userid'].\" and lastly, my password is \".$row['pass'].\"&lt;br&gt;\";\n        $isAdmin=true;\n        // We have correctly matched the Username and Password\n        // Lets give this person full access\n    }\n    if($isAdmin)\n    {\n        echo \"The check passed.

We have a verified admin!\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Congrats, you just allowed me to enter your super-protected admins only section with me entering a false username and a false password. Seriously, if you don't believe me, create the database with the code I provided, and run this PHP code - which at glance REALLY does seem to verify the username and password rather nicely.</p>\n\n<p>So, in answer, THAT IS WHY YOU ARE BEING YELLED AT.</p>\n\n<p>So, lets have a look at what went wrong, and why I just got into your super-admin-only-bat-cave. I took a guess and assumed that you weren't being careful with your inputs and simply passed them to the database directly. I constructed the input in a way tht would CHANGE the query that you were actually running. So, what was it supposed to be, and what did it end up being?</p>\n\n<pre><code>select id, userid, pass from users where userid='$user' and pass='$pass'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That's the query, but when we replace the variables with the actual inputs that we used, we get the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>select id, userid, pass from users where userid='bob' and pass='n' or 1=1 or 'm=m'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See how I constructed my \"password\" so that it would first close the single quote around the password, then introduce a completely new comparison? Then just for safety, I added another \"string\" so that the single quote would get closed as expected in the code we originally had.</p>\n\n<p>However, this isn't about folks yelling at you now, this is about showing you how to make your code more secure.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, so what went wrong, and how can we fix it?</p>\n\n<p>This is a classic SQL injection attack. One of the simplest for that matter. On the scale of attack vectors, this is a toddler attacking a tank - and winning.</p>\n\n<p>So, how do we protect your sacred admin section and make it nice and secure? The first thing to do will be to stop using those really old and deprecated <code>mysql_*</code> functions. I know, you followed a tutorial you found online and it works, but it's old, it's outdated and in the space of a few minutes, I have just broken past it without so much as breaking a sweat.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you have the better options of using <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php\">mysqli_</a> or <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php\">PDO</a>. I am personally a big fan of PDO, so I will be using PDO in the rest of this answer. There are pro's and con's, but personally I find that the pro's far outweigh the con's. It's portable across multiple database engines - whether you are using MySQL or Oracle or just about bloody anything - just by changing the connection string, it has all the fancy features we want to use and it is nice and clean. I like clean.</p>\n\n<p>Now, lets have a look at that code again, this time written using a PDO object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?php \n\n    if(!empty($_POST['user']))\n    {\n        $user=$_POST['user'];\n    }   \n    else\n    {\n        $user='bob';\n    }\n    if(!empty($_POST['pass']))\n    {\n        $pass=$_POST['pass'];\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        $pass='bob';\n    }\n    $isAdmin=false;\n\n    $database='prep';\n    $pdo=new PDO ('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=prep', 'prepared', 'example');\n    $sql=\"select id, userid, pass from users where userid=:user and pass=:password\";\n    $myPDO = $pdo-&gt;prepare($sql, array(PDO::ATTR_CURSOR =&gt; PDO::CURSOR_FWDONLY));\n    if($myPDO-&gt;execute(array(':user' =&gt; $user, ':password' =&gt; $pass)))\n    {\n        while($row=$myPDO-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC))\n        {\n            echo \"My id is \".$row['id'].\" and my username is \".$row['userid'].\" and lastly, my password is \".$row['pass'].\"&lt;br&gt;\";\n            $isAdmin=true;\n            // We have correctly matched the Username and Password\n            // Lets give this person full access\n        }\n    }\n\n    if($isAdmin)\n    {\n        echo \"The check passed. We have a verified admin!&lt;br&gt;\";\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        echo \"You could not be verified. Please try again...&lt;br&gt;\";\n    }\n\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;form name=\"exploited\" method='post'&gt;\n    User: &lt;input type='text' name='user'&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    Pass: &lt;input type='text' name='pass'&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;input type='submit'&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The major differences are that there are no more <code>mysql_*</code> functions. It's all done via a PDO object, secondly, it is using a prepared statement. Now, what's a prepred statement you ask? It's a way to tell the database ahead of running a query, what the query is that we are going to run. In this case, we tell the database: \"Hi, I am going to run a select statement wanting id, userid and pass from the table users where the userid is a variable and the pass is also a variable.\".</p>\n\n<p>Then, in the execute statement, we pass the database an array with all the variables that it now expects.</p>\n\n<p>The results are fantastic. Lets try those username and password combinations from before again:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user: bob\npass: somePass\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>User wasn't verified. Awesome.</p>\n\n<p>How about:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user: Fluffeh\npass: mypass\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Oh, I just got a little excited, it worked: The check passed. We have a verified admin!</p>\n\n<p>Now, lets try the data that a clever chap would enter to try to get past our little verification system:</p>\n\n<pre><code>user: bob\npass: n' or 1=1 or 'm=m\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This time, we get the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>You could not be verified. Please try again...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is why you are being yelled at when posting questions - it's because people can see that your code can be bypassed wihout even trying. Please, do use this question and answer to improve your code, to make it more secure and to use functions that are current.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, this isn't to say that this is PERFECT code. There are many more things that you could do to improve it, use hashed passwords for example, ensure that when you store sensetive information in the database, you don't store it in plain text, have multiple levels of verification - but really, if you just change your old injection prone code to this, you will be WELL along the way to writing good code - and the fact that you have gotten this far and are still reading gives me a sense of hope that you will not only implement this type of code when writing your websites and applications, but that you might go out and research those other things I just mentioned - and more. Write the best code you can, not the most basic code that barely functions.</p>\n", "title": "Why shouldn&#39;t I use mysql_* functions in PHP?", "tags": ["php", "mysql", "database", "mysqli", "pdo"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12859942/why-shouldnt-i-use-mysql-functions-in-php/18872292#18872292", "question_id": 12859942, "answer_id": 18872292}, {"body": "<h2>Ease of use</h2>\n\n<p>The analytic and synthetic reasons were already mentioned.

It's often incorrectly portrayed as failed <em>security</em> feature however. But magic_quotes are as much a failed security feature as tennis balls have failed as nutrition source. That simply wasn't their purpose.</p>\n  \n  <p>The original implementation in PHP2/FI introduced it explicitly with just \"<em>quotes will be automatically escaped making it easier to pass form data directly to msql queries</em>\". Notably it was accidentially safe to use with <a href=\"http://www.hughes.com.au/products/msql/\">mSQL</a>, as that supported ASCII only.<br>\n  Then PHP3/Zend reintroduced magic_quotes for MySQL and misdocumented it. But originally it was just a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16098194/why-magic-quotes-has-been-removed-from-php-5-4\">convenience feature</a>, not intend for security. </p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>How prepared statements differ</h3>\n\n<p>When you scramble string variables into the SQL queries, it doesn't just get more intricate for you to follow. It's also extraneous effort for MySQL to segregate code and data again.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/niZ7j.png\"></p>\n\n<p>SQL injections simply are when <em>data bleeds into code</em> context. A database server can't later spot where PHP originally glued variables inbetween query clauses.</p>\n\n<p>With bound parameters you separate SQL code and SQL-context values in your PHP code. But it doesn't get shuffled up again behind the scenes (except with PDO::EMULATE_PREPARES). Your database receives the unvaried SQL commands and 1:1 variable values.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/M7PXp.png\"></p>\n\n<p>While this answer stresses that you should care about the readability advantages of dropping <s><code>mysql_</code></s>. There's occasionally also a performance advantage (repeated INSERTs with just differing values) due to this visible and technical data/code separation. </p>\n\n<p>Beware that parameter binding still isn't a magic one-stop solution against <em>all</em> SQL injections. It handles the most common use for data/values. But can't whitelist column name / table identifiers, help with dynamic clause construction, or just plain array value lists.</p>\n\n<h3>Hybrid PDO use</h3>\n\n<p>These <code>pdo_*</code> wrapper functions make a coding-friendly stop-gap API. (It's pretty much what <code>MYSQLI</code> could have been if it wasn't for the idiosyncratic function signature shift). They also expose the real PDO at most times.<br>\nRewriting doesn't have to stop at using the new pdo_ function names. You could one by one transition each pdo_query() into a plain $pdo->prepare()->execute() call.</p>\n\n<p>It's best to start at simplifying again however. For example the common result fetching:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$result = pdo_query(\"SELECT * FROM tbl\");\nwhile ($row = pdo_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Can be replaced with just an foreach iteration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($result as $row) {\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or better yet a direct and complete array retrieval:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$result-&gt;fetchAll();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You'll get more helpful warnings in most cases than PDO or mysql_ usually provide after failed queries.</p>\n\n<h3>Other options</h3>\n\n<p>So this hopefully visualized some <em>practical</em> reasons and a worthwile pathway to drop <s><code>mysql_</code></s>.</p>\n\n<p>Just switching to <a href=\"/questions/tagged/pdo\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;pdo&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">pdo</a> doesn't quite cut it. <code>pdo_query()</code> is also just a frontend onto it.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you also introduce parameter binding or can utilize something else from the nicer API, it's a pointless switch. I hope it's portrayed simple enough to not further the discouragement to newcomers. (Education usually works better than prohibition.)</p>\n\n<p>While it qualifies for the simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work category, it's also still very experimental code. I just wrote it over the weekend. There's a plethora of alternatives however. Just google for <a href=\"https://www.google.de/search?client=stackoverflow&amp;q=PHP+database+abstraction\">PHP database abstraction</a> and browse a little. There always have been and will be lots of excellent libraries for such tasks.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to simplify your database interaction further, mappers like <a href=\"http://j4mie.github.io/idiormandparis/\">Paris/Idiorm</a> are worth a try. Just like nobody uses the bland DOM in JavaScript anymore, you don't have to babysit a raw database interface nowadays.</p>\n", "title": "Why shouldn&#39;t I use mysql_* functions in PHP?", "tags": ["php", "mysql", "database", "mysqli", "pdo"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12859942/why-shouldnt-i-use-mysql-functions-in-php/20767765#20767765", "question_id": 12859942, "answer_id": 20767765}, {"body": "<p>The MySQL extension is the oldest of the three and was the original way that developers used to communicate with MySQL.

The root issue is that integer comparison is inherently implemented via integer subtractions. This gives rise to the following cases.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Comparison     Subtraction\n----------     -----------\nA &lt; B      --&gt; A - B &lt; 0\nA = B      --&gt; A - B = 0\nA &gt; B      --&gt; A - B &gt; 0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, when <code>A &lt; B</code> the subtraction has to borrow a high-bit for the subtraction to be correct, just like you carry and borrow when adding and subtracting by hand. This \"borrowed\" bit was usually referred to as the <em>carry bit</em> and would be testable by a branch instruction. A second bit called the <em>zero bit</em> would be set if the subtraction were identically zero which implied equality.</p>\n\n<p>There were usually at least two conditional branch instructions, one to branch on the carry bit and one on the zero bit.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to get at the heart of the matter, let's expand the previous table to include the carry and zero bit results.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Comparison     Subtraction  Carry Bit  Zero Bit\n----------     -----------  ---------  --------\nA &lt; B      --&gt; A - B &lt; 0    0          0\nA = B      --&gt; A - B = 0    1          1\nA &gt; B      --&gt; A - B &gt; 0    1          0\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, implementing a branch for <code>A &lt; B</code> can be done in one instruction, because the carry bit is clear <em>only</em> in this case, , that is,</p>\n\n<pre><code>;; Implementation of \"if (A &lt; B) goto address;\"\ncmp  A, B          ;; compare A to B\nbcz  address       ;; Branch if Carry is Zero to the new address\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But, if we want to do a less-than-or-equal comparison, we need to do an additional check of the zero flag to catch the case of equality.</p>\n\n<pre><code>;; Implementation of \"if (A &lt;= B) goto address;\"\ncmp A, B           ;; compare A to B\nbcz address        ;; branch if A &lt; B\nbzs address        ;; also, Branch if the Zero bit is Set\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, on some machines, using a \"less than\" comparison <em>might</em> save <em>one machine instruction</em>.  This was relevant in the era of sub-megahertz processor speed and 1:1 CPU-to-memory speed ratios, but it is almost totally irrelevant today.</p>\n", "title": "Is &lt; faster than &lt;=?", "tags": ["c++", "performance", "assembly"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12135518/is-faster-than/12146965#12146965", "question_id": 12135518, "answer_id": 12146965}, {"body": "<p>For floating point code, the &lt;= comparison may indeed be slower (by one instruction) even on modern architectures.

IEEE 754 binary floating point numbers (the kind used by JavaScript) can't exactly represent most non-integer numbers, and so all three numeric literals above get rounded to a nearby valid floating point number.

Just compare them:</p>\n\n<pre><code>> <b><i>0.014999999999999999 === 0.0150000000000000001</i></b>\ntrue</code></pre>\n\n<p>So when I write <code>m = 0.0150000000000000001</code>, the <em>exact value of <code>m</code></em> that I end up with is closer to <code>0.01</code> than it is to <code>0.02</code>. And yet, if I convert <code>m</code> to a String...</p>\n\n<pre><code>> <b><i>var m = 0.0150000000000000001;</i></b>\n> <b><i>console.log(String(m));</i></b>\n0.015\n> <b><i>var m = 0.014999999999999999;</i></b>\n> <b><i>console.log(String(m));</i></b>\n0.015</code></pre>\n\n<p>... I get 0.015, which should round to 0.02, and which is noticeably <em>not</em> the 56-decimal-place number I earlier said that all of these numbers were exactly equal to. So what dark magic is this?</p>\n\n<p>The answer can be found in the ECMAScript specification, in section <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/#sec-tostring-applied-to-the-number-type\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>7.1.12.1: ToString applied to the Number type</em></a>. Here the rules for converting some Number <em>m</em> to a String are laid down. The key part is point 5, in which an integer <em>s</em> is generated whose digits will be used in the String representation of <em>m</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>let <em>n</em>, <em>k</em>, and <em>s</em> be integers such that <em>k</em> \u2265 1, 10<sup><i>k</i>-1</sup> \u2264 <em>s</em> &lt; 10<sup><i>k</i></sup>, the Number value for <em>s</em> \u00d7 10<sup><i>n</i>-<i>k</i></sup> is <em>m</em>, and <em>k</em> is as small as possible. Note that k is the number of digits in the decimal representation of <em>s</em>, that <em>s</em> is not divisible by 10, and that the least significant digit of <em>s</em> is not necessarily uniquely determined by these criteria.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The key part here is the requirement that \"<em>k</em> is as small as possible\". What that requirement amounts to is a requirement that, given a Number <code>m</code>, the value of <code>String(m)</code> must have <em>the least possible number of digits</em> while still satisfying the requirement that <code>Number(String(m)) === m</code>. Since we already know that <code>0.015 === 0.0150000000000000001</code>, it's now clear why <code>String(0.0150000000000000001) === '0.015'</code> must be true.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, none of this discussion has directly answered what <code>roundTo2DP(m)</code> <em>should</em> return. If <code>m</code>'s exact value is 0.01499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595458984375, but its String representation is '0.015', then what is the <em>correct</em> answer - mathematically, practically, philosophically, or whatever - when we round it to two decimal places?</p>\n\n<p>There is no single correct answer to this. It depends upon your use case. You probably want to respect the String representation and round upwards when:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The value being represented is inherently discrete, e.g. an amount of currency in a 3-decimal-place currency like dinars. In this case, the <em>true</em> value of a Number like 0.015 <em>is</em> 0.015, and the 0.0149999999... representation that it gets in binary floating point is a rounding error. (Of course, many will argue, reasonably, that you should use a decimal library for handling such values and never represent them as binary floating point Numbers in the first place.)</li>\n<li>The value was typed by a user. In this case, again, the exact decimal number entered is more 'true' than the nearest binary floating point representation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>On the other hand, you probably want to respect the binary floating point value and round downwards when your value is from an inherently continuous scale - for instance, if it's a reading from a sensor.</p>\n\n<p>These two approaches require different code. To respect the String representation of the Number, we can (with quite a bit of reasonably subtle code) implement our own rounding that acts directly on the String representation, digit by digit, using the same algorithm you would've used in school when you were taught how to round numbers. Below is an example which respects the OP's requirement of representing the number to 2 decimal places \"only when necessary\" by stripping trailing zeroes after the decimal point; you may, of course, need to tweak it to your precise needs.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n * Converts num to a decimal string (if it isn't one already) and then rounds it\n * to at most dp decimal places.\n *\n * For explanation of why you'd want to perform rounding operations on a String\n * rather than a Number, see http://stackoverflow.com/a/38676273/1709587\n *\n * @param {(number|string)} num\n * @param {number} dp\n * @return {string}\n */\nfunction roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes (num, dp) {\n    if (arguments.length != 2) throw new Error(\"2 arguments required\");\n\n    num = String(num);\n    if (num.indexOf('e+') != -1) {\n        // Can't round numbers this large because their string representation\n        // contains an exponent, like 9.99e+37\n        throw new Error(\"num too large\");\n    }\n    if (num.indexOf('.') == -1) {\n        // Nothing to do\n        return num;\n    }\n\n    var parts = num.split('.'),\n        beforePoint = parts[0],\n        afterPoint = parts[1],\n        shouldRoundUp = afterPoint[dp] &gt;= 5,\n        finalNumber;\n\n    afterPoint = afterPoint.slice(0, dp);\n    if (!shouldRoundUp) {\n        finalNumber = beforePoint + '.' + afterPoint;\n    } else if (/^9+$/.test(afterPoint)) {\n        // If we need to round up a number like 1.9999, increment the integer\n        // before the decimal point and discard the fractional part.\n        finalNumber = Number(beforePoint)+1;\n    } else {\n        // Starting from the last digit, increment digits until we find one\n        // that is not 9, then stop\n        var i = dp-1;\n        while (true) {\n            if (afterPoint[i] == '9') {\n                afterPoint = afterPoint.substr(0, dp) +\n                             '0' +\n                             afterPoint.substr(dp+1);\n                i--;\n            } else {\n                afterPoint = afterPoint.substr(0, i) +\n                             (Number(afterPoint[i]) + 1) +\n                             afterPoint.substr(i+1);\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        finalNumber = beforePoint + '.' + afterPoint;\n    }\n\n    // Remove trailing zeroes from fractional part before returning\n    return finalNumber.replace(/0+$/, '')\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example usage:</p>\n\n<pre><code>> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes(1.6, 2)</i></b>\n'1.6'\n> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes(10000, 2)</i></b>\n'10000'\n> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes(0.015, 2)</i></b>\n'0.02'\n> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes('0.015000', 2)</i></b>\n'0.02'\n> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes(1, 1)</i></b>\n'1'\n> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes('0.015', 2)</i></b>\n'0.02'\n> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes(0.01499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595458984375, 2)</i></b>\n'0.02'\n> <b><i>roundStringNumberWithoutTrailingZeroes('0.01499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595458984375', 2)</i></b>\n'0.01'</code></pre>\n\n<p>The function above is <em>probably</em> what you want to use to avoid users ever witnessing numbers that they have entered being rounded wrongly.</p>\n\n<p>(As an alternative, you could also try the <a href=\"https://github.com/jhohlfeld/round10\" rel=\"nofollow\">round10</a> library which provides a similarly-behaving function with a wildly different implementation.)</p>\n\n<p>But what if you have the second kind of Number - a value taken from a continuous scale, where there's no reason to think that approximate decimal representations with fewer decimal places are more <em>accurate</em> than those with more?

Although in an ideal world, this would have been a better approach, if you look at some of the perf links given in <a href=\"http://allyoucanleet.com/post/21624742336/jsconf-us-12-slides\">these slides</a>, it is not hard to draw the conclusion that the quality of those 'native implementations' vary a lot browser-to-browser. Firefox is damn fast in some of the functions, and in some Chrome dominates. (I imagine there would be some scenarios where IE would dominate too). I believe that it's better to prefer a code whose <strong>performance</strong> is more consistent across browsers.</p>\n  \n  <p>Do read the blog post earlier, and instead of believing it for its sake, judge for yourself by running the <a href=\"http://lodash.com/benchmarks\">benchmarks</a>.

Still I think my point holds:</p>\n\n<p>IMHO this discussion got blown out of proportion quite a bit. Quoting the aforementioned <a href=\"http://kitcambridge.be/blog/say-hello-to-lo-dash/\">blog post</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most JavaScript utility libraries, such as Underscore, Valentine, and\n  wu, rely on the \u201cnative-first dual approach.\u201d This approach prefers\n  native implementations, falling back to vanilla JavaScript only if the\n  native equivalent is not supported. But jsPerf revealed an interesting\n  trend: the most efficient way to iterate over an array or array-like\n  collection is to avoid the native implementations entirely, opting for\n  simple loops instead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As if \"simple loops\" and \"vanilla Javascript\" are more native than Array or Object method implementations. Jeez ...</p>\n\n<p>It certainly would be nice to have a single source of truth, but there isn't. Even if you've been told otherwise, there is no Vanilla God, my dear. I'm sorry. The only assumption that really holds is that we are all writing Javascript code that aims at performing well in all major browsers, knowing that all of them have different implementations of the same things. It's a bitch to cope with, to put it mildly. But that's the premise, whether you like it or not. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe y'all are working on large scale projects that need twitterish performance so that you really see the difference <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/lodash-underscore\">between 850,000 (underscore) vs. 2,500,000 (lodash) iterations over a list per sec</a> right now! </p>\n\n<p>I for one am not. I mean, I worked projects where I had to address performance issues, but they were never solved or caused by neither Underscore nor Lo-Dash. And unless I get hold of the real differences in implementation and performance (we're talking C++ right now) of lets say a loop over an iterable (object or array, sparse or not!), I rather don't get bothered with any claims based on the results of a benchmark platform that <a href=\"https://github.com/bestiejs/benchmark.js/blob/master/package.json\">is already opinionated</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It only needs one single update of lets say Rhino to set its Array method implementations on fire in a fashion that not a single \"medieval loop methods perform better and forever and whatnot\" priest can argue his/her way around the simple fact that all of a sudden array methods in FF are much faster than his/her opinionated brainfuck. Man, you just can't cheat your runtime environment by cheating your runtime environment! Think about that when promoting ... </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>your utility belt</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>... next time. </p>\n\n<p>So to keep it relevant: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use Underscore if you're into convenience without sacrificing native ish.</li>\n<li>Use Lo-Dash if you're into convenience and like its extended feature catalogue (deep copy etc.) and if you're in desperate need of instant performance and most importantly don't mind settling for an alternative as soon as native API's outshine opinionated workaurounds. Which is going to happen soon. Period.</li>\n<li>There's even a third solution. DIY! Know your environments. Know about inconsistencies. Read their (<a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/lodash\">John-David</a>'s and <a href=\"https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore\">Jeremy</a>'s) code. Don't use this or that without being able to explain why a consistency/compatibility layer is really needed and enhances your workflow or improves the performance of your app. It is very likely that your requirements are satisfied with a simple polyfill that you're perfectly able to write yourself. Both libraries are just plain vanilla with a little bit of sugar. <a href=\"https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/commit/4e4bc194c0a0e06aa8f7633695ad10030d871a2b#commitcomment-1361732\">They both just fight over who's serving the sweetest pie</a>. But believe me, in the end both are only cooking with water. There's no Vanilla God so there can't be no Vanilla pope, right? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Choose whatever approach fits your needs the most.

One exception to this rule is a directive with <code>scope: { ... }</code> -- this creates an \"isolate\" scope that does not prototypically inherit.  This construct is often used when creating a \"reusable component\" directive.</p>\n\n<p>As for the nuances, scope inheritance is normally straightfoward... until you need <strong>2-way data binding</strong> (i.e., form elements, ng-model) in the child scope.  Ng-repeat, ng-switch, and ng-include can trip you up if you try to bind to a <strong>primitive</strong> (e.g., number, string, boolean) in the parent scope from inside the child scope.  It doesn't work the way most people expect it should work.  The child scope gets its own property that hides/shadows the parent property of the same name.  Your workarounds are</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>define objects in the parent for your model, then reference a property of that object  in the child:  parentObj.someProp</li>\n<li>use $parent.parentScopeProperty (not always possible, but easier than 1. where possible)</li>\n<li>define a function on the parent scope, and call it from the child (not always possible)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><hr>\n<strong>L-o-n-g answer</strong>:</p>\n\n<h2>JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Also placed on the AngularJS wiki:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes\">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes</a></p>\n\n<p>It is important to first have a solid understanding of prototypal inheritance, especially if you are coming from a server-side background and you are more failiar with class-ical inheritance.  So let's review that first.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose parentScope has properties aString, aNumber, anArray, anObject, and aFunction.  If childScope prototypically inherits from parentScope, we have:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/aTAGg.png\" alt=\"prototypal inheritance\"></p>\n\n<p>(Note that to save space, I show the <code>anArray</code> object as a single blue object with its three values, rather than an single blue object with three separate gray literals.)</p>\n\n<p>If we try to access a property defined on the parentScope from the child scope, JavaScript will first look in the child scope, not find the property, then look in the inherited scope, and find the property.  (If it didn't find the property in the parentScope, it would continue up the prototype chain... all the way up to the root scope). So, these are all true:</p>\n\n<pre><code>childScope.aString === 'parent string'\nchildScope.anArray[1] === 20\nchildScope.anObject.property1 === 'parent prop1'\nchildScope.aFunction() === 'parent output'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Suppose we then do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>childScope.aString = 'child string'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The prototype chain is not consulted, and a new aString property is added to the childScope.  <strong>This new property hides/shadows the parentScope property with the same name.</strong>  This will become very important when we discuss ng-repeat and ng-include below.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/OyVPW.png\" alt=\"property hiding\"></p>\n\n<p>Suppose we then do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>childScope.anArray[1] = '22'\nchildScope.anObject.property1 = 'child prop1'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The prototype chain is consulted because the objects (anArray and anObject) are not found in the childScope.  The objects are found in the parentScope, and the property values are updated on the original objects.  No new properties are added to the childScope;  no new objects are created.  (Note that in JavaScript arrays and functions are also objects.)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2QceU.png\" alt=\"follow the prototype chain\"></p>\n\n<p>Suppose we then do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>childScope.anArray = [100, 555]\nchildScope.anObject = { name: 'Mark', country: 'USA' }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The prototype chain is not consulted, and child scope gets two new object properties that hide/shadow the parentScope object properties with the same names.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/hKetH.png\" alt=\"more property hiding\"></p>\n\n<p>Takeaways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If we read childScope.propertyX, and childScope has propertyX, then the prototype chain is not consulted.</li>\n<li>If we set childScope.propertyX, the prototype chain is not consulted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>One last scenario:</p>\n\n<pre><code>delete childScope.anArray\nchildScope.anArray[1] === 22  // true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We deleted the childScope property first, then when we try to access the property again, the prototype chain is consulted.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/56uoe.png\" alt=\"after removing a child property\"></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Angular Scope Inheritance</h2>\n\n<p>The contenders:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The following create new scopes, and inherit prototypically: ng-repeat, ng-include, ng-switch, ng-controller, directive with <code>scope: true</code>, directive with <code>transclude: true</code>.</li>\n<li>The following creates a new scope which does not inherit prototypically: directive with <code>scope: { ... }</code>.  This creates an \"isolate\" scope instead.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note, by default, directives do not create new scope -- i.e., the default is <code>scope: false</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>ng-include</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose we have in our controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.myPrimitive = 50;\n$scope.myObject    = {aNumber: 11};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in our HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"/tpl1.html\"&gt;\n&lt;input ng-model=\"myPrimitive\"&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;div ng-include src=\"'/tpl1.html'\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;script type=\"text/ng-template\" id=\"/tpl2.html\"&gt;\n&lt;input ng-model=\"myObject.aNumber\"&gt;\n&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;div ng-include src=\"'/tpl2.html'\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each ng-include generates a new child scope, which prototypically inherits from the parent scope.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ziDfx.png\" alt=\"ng-include child scopes\"></p>\n\n<p>Typing (say, \"77\") into the first input textbox causes the child scope to get a new <code>myPrimitive</code> scope property that hides/shadows the parent scope property of the same name.  This is probably not what you want/expect.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7l8dg.png\" alt=\"ng-include with a primitive\"></p>\n\n<p>Typing (say, \"99\") into the second input textbox does not result in a new child property.  Because tpl2.html binds the model to an object property, prototypal inheritance kicks in when the ngModel looks for object myObject -- it finds it in the parent scope.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ZqqloMS.png\" alt=\"ng-include with an object\"></p>\n\n<p>We can rewrite the first template to use $parent, if we don't want to change our model from a primitive to an object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input ng-model=\"$parent.myPrimitive\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Typing (say, \"22\") into this input textbox does not result in a new child property.  The model is now bound to a property of the parent scope (because $parent is a child scope property that references the parent scope).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/kd8pj.png\" alt=\"ng-include with $parent\"></p>\n\n<p>For all scopes (prototypal or not), Angular always tracks a parent-child relationship (i.e., a hierarchy), via scope properties $parent, $$childHead and $$childTail.  I normally don't show these scope properties in the diagrams.</p>\n\n<p>For scenarios where form elements are not involved, another solution is to define a function on the parent scope to modify the primitive.  Then ensure the child always calls this function, which will be available to the child scope due to prototypal inheritance. E.g.,</p>\n\n<pre><code>// in the parent scope\n$scope.setMyPrimitive = function(value) {\n     $scope.myPrimitive = value;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is a <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/mrajcok/jNxyE/\">sample fiddle</a> that uses this \"parent function\" approach.  (The fiddle was written as part of this answer: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/14104318/215945\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/14104318/215945</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13782671/215945\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13782671/215945</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1267\">https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/1267</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>ng-switch</h3>\n\n<p>ng-switch scope inheritance works just like ng-include.  So if you need 2-way data binding to a primitive in the parent scope, use $parent, or change the model to be an object and then bind to a property of that object.  This will avoid child scope hiding/shadowing of parent scope properties.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12405005/angularjs-bind-scope-of-a-switch-case/12414410\">AngularJS, bind scope of a switch-case?</a></p>\n\n<h3>ng-repeat</h3>\n\n<p>Ng-repeat works a little differently.  Suppose we have in our controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.myArrayOfPrimitives = [ 11, 22 ];\n$scope.myArrayOfObjects    = [{num: 101}, {num: 202}]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in our HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li ng-repeat=\"num in myArrayOfPrimitives\"&gt;\n       &lt;input ng-model=\"num\"&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li ng-repeat=\"obj in myArrayOfObjects\"&gt;\n       &lt;input ng-model=\"obj.num\"&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For each item/iteration, ng-repeat creates a new scope, which prototypically inherits from the parent scope, <strong>but it also assigns the item's value to a new property on the new child scope</strong>.  (The name of the new property is the loop variable's name.)  Here's what the Angular source code for ng-repeat actually is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>childScope = scope.$new();  // child scope prototypically inherits from parent scope\n...\nchildScope[valueIdent] = value;  // creates a new childScope property\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If item is a primitive (as in myArrayOfPrimitives), essentially a copy of the value is assigned to the new child scope property.  Changing the child scope property's value (i.e., using ng-model, hence child scope <code>num</code>) does <strong>not</strong> change the array the parent scope references.  So in the first ng-repeat above, each child scope gets a <code>num</code> property that is independent of the myArrayOfPrimitives array:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/nLoiW.png\" alt=\"ng-repeat with primitives\"></p>\n\n<p>This ng-repeat will not work (like you want/expect it to).  Typing into the textboxes changes the values in the gray boxes, which are only visible in the child scopes.  What we want is for the inputs to affect the myArrayOfPrimitives array, not a child scope primitive property.  To accomplish this, we need to change the model to be an array of objects.</p>\n\n<p>So, if item is an object, a reference to the original object (not a copy) is assigned to the new child scope property.  Changing the child scope property's value (i.e., using ng-model, hence <code>obj.num</code>) <strong>does</strong> change the object the parent scope references.  So in the second ng-repeat above, we have:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QSjTJ.png\" alt=\"ng-repeat with objects\"></p>\n\n<p>(I colored one line gray just so that it is clear where it is going.)</p>\n\n<p>This works as expected.  Typing into the textboxes changes the values in the gray boxes, which are visible to both the child and parent scopes.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13714884/difficulty-with-ng-model-ng-repeat-and-inputs\">Difficulty with ng-model, ng-repeat, and inputs</a> and \n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/13782671/215945\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/13782671/215945</a></p>\n\n<h3>ng-controller</h3>\n\n<p>Nesting controllers using ng-controller results in normal prototypal inheritance, just like ng-include and ng-switch, so the same techniques apply.\nHowever, \"it is considered bad form for two controllers to share information via $scope inheritance\" -- <a href=\"http://onehungrymind.com/angularjs-sticky-notes-pt-1-architecture/\">http://onehungrymind.com/angularjs-sticky-notes-pt-1-architecture/</a>\nA service should be used to share data between controllers instead.</p>\n\n<p>(If you really want to share data via controllers scope inheritance, there is nothing you need to do.  The child scope will have access to all of the parent scope properties.\nSee also <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13825419/controller-load-order-differs-when-loading-or-navigating/13843771#13843771\">Controller load order differs when loading or navigating</a>)</p>\n\n<h3>directives</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>default (<code>scope: false</code>) - the directive does not create a new scope, so there is no inheritance here.  This is easy, but also dangerous because, e.g., a directive might think it is creating a new property on the scope, when in fact it is clobbering an existing property.  This is not a good choice for writing directives that are intended as reusable components.</li>\n<li><code>scope: true</code> - the directive creates a new child scope that prototypically inherits from the parent scope.  If more than one directive (on the same DOM element) requests a new scope, only one new child scope is created.  Since we have \"normal\" prototypal inheritance, this is like ng-include and ng-switch, so be wary of 2-way data binding to parent scope primitives, and child scope hiding/shadowing of parent scope properties.</li>\n<li><code>scope: { ... }</code> - the directive creates a new isolate/isolated scope.  It does not prototypically inherit.  This is usually your best choice when creating reusable components, since the directive cannot accidentally read or modify the parent scope.  However, such directives often need access to a few parent scope properties.  The object hash is used to set up two-way binding (using '=') or one-way binding (using '@') between the parent scope and the isolate scope.  There is also '&amp;' to bind to parent scope expressions.  So, these all create local scope properties that are derived from the parent scope.\nNote that attributes are used to help set up the binding -- you can't just reference parent scope property names in the object hash, you have to use an attribute.  E.g., this won't work if you want to bind to parent property <code>parentProp</code> in the isolated scope: <code>&lt;div my-directive&gt;</code> and <code>scope: { localProp: '@parentProp' }</code>.  An attribute must be used to specify each parent property that the directive wants to bind to: <code>&lt;div my-directive the-Parent-Prop=parentProp&gt;</code> and <code>scope: { localProp: '@theParentProp' }</code>.\n<br>Isolate scope's <code>__proto__</code> references Object.\nIsolate scope's $parent references the parent scope, so although it is isolated and doesn't inherit prototypically from the parent scope, it is still a child scope.\n<br>For the picture below we have\n<br>  <code>&lt;my-directive interpolated=\"{{parentProp1}}\" twowayBinding=\"parentProp2\"&gt;</code> and\n<br>  <code>scope: { interpolatedProp: '@interpolated', twowayBindingProp: '=twowayBinding' }</code>\n<br>Also, assume the directive does this in its linking function: <code>scope.someIsolateProp = \"I'm isolated\"</code>\n<br> <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/MUxS4.png\" alt=\"isolated scope\">\n<br>For more information on isolate scopes see <a href=\"http://onehungrymind.com/angularjs-sticky-notes-pt-2-isolated-scope/\">http://onehungrymind.com/angularjs-sticky-notes-pt-2-isolated-scope/</a></li>\n<li><code>transclude: true</code> - the directive creates a new \"transcluded\" child scope, which prototypically inherits from the parent scope.  The transcluded and the isolated scope (if any) are siblings -- the $parent property of each scope references the same parent scope.  When a transcluded and an isolate scope both exist, isolate scope property $$nextSibling will reference the transcluded scope.  I'm not aware of any nuances with the transcluded scope.\n<br>For the picture below, assume the same directive as above with this addition: <code>transclude: true</code>\n<br><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/fkWHA.png\" alt=\"transcluded scope\"></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/mrajcok/7g3QM/\">fiddle</a> has a <code>showScope()</code> function that can be used to examine an isolate and transcluded scope.  See the instructions in the comments in the fiddle.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\n<p>There are four types of scopes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>normal prototypal scope inheritance -- ng-include, ng-switch, ng-controller, directive with <code>scope: true</code></li>\n<li>normal prototypal scope inheritance with a copy/assignment -- ng-repeat.  Each iteration of ng-repeat creates a new child scope, and that new child scope always gets a new property.</li>\n<li>isolate scope -- directive with <code>scope: {...}</code>.  This one is not prototypal, but '=', '@', and '&amp;' provide a mechanism to access parent scope properties, via attributes.</li>\n<li>transcluded scope -- directive with <code>transclude: true</code>.  This one is also normal prototypal scope inheritance, but it is also a sibling of any isolate scope.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For all scopes (prototypal or not), Angular always tracks a parent-child relationship (i.e., a hierarchy), via properties $parent and $$childHead and $$childTail.</p>\n\n<p>Diagrams were generated with <a href=\"/questions/tagged/graphviz\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'graphviz'\" rel=\"tag\">graphviz</a> \"*.dot\" files, which are on <a href=\"https://github.com/mrajcok/angularjs-prototypal-inheritance-diagrams\">github</a>.

If you use <code>title=title1</code> or <code>title=\"title1\"</code>, the value of DOM attribute \"title\" is simply the string <code>title1</code>.  If you use <code>title=\"{{title}}\"</code>, the value of the DOM attribute \"title\" is the interpolated value of <code>{{title}}</code>, hence the string will be whatever parent scope property \"title\" is currently set to.  Since attribute values are always strings, you will always end up with a string value for this property in the directive's scope when using @.</p>\n\n<p>= binds a local/directive scope property to <strong>a parent scope property</strong>.  So with =, you use the parent model/scope property name as the value of the DOM attribute.  You can't use <code>{{}}</code>s with =.</p>\n\n<p>With @, you can do things like <code>title=\"{{title}} and then some\"</code> -- {{title}} is interpolated, then the string \"and them some\" is concatenated with it.  The final concatenated string is what the local/directive scope property gets.  (You can't do this with =, only @.)</p>\n\n<p>With @, you will need to use <code>attr.$observe('title', function(value) { ... })</code> if you need to use the value in your link(ing) function.  E.g., <code>if(scope.title == \"...\")</code> won't work like you expect.  Note that this means you can only access this attribute <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Directives\"><em>asynchronously</em></a>.\nYou don't need to use $observe() if you are only using the value in a template.  E.g., <code>template: '&lt;div&gt;{{title}}&lt;/div&gt;'</code>.</p>\n\n<p>With =, you don't need to use $observe.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>can I also access the parent scope directly, without decorating my element with an attribute?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, but only if you don't use an isolate scope.  Remove this line from your directive -- <code>scope: { ... }</code> -- and then your directive will not create a new scope.  It will use the parent scope.  You can then access all of the parent scope properties directly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The documentation says \"Often it's desirable to pass data from the isolated scope via an expression and to the parent scope\", but that seems to work fine with bidirectional binding too. Why would the expression route be better?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, bidirectional binding allows the local/directive scope and the parent scope to share data.  \"Expression binding\" allows the directive to call an expression (or function) defined by a DOM attribute -- and you can also pass data as arguments to the expression or function.  So, if you don't need to share data with the parent -- you just want to call a function defined in the parent scope -- you can use the &amp; syntax.</p>\n\n<p>See also</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://onehungrymind.com/angularjs-sticky-notes-pt-2-isolated-scope/\">Lukas's isolated scope blog post</a> (covers @, =, &amp;)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13032621/need-some-examples-of-binding-attributes-in-custom-angularjs-tags/13033249#13033249\">dnc253's explanation</a> of @ and =</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14049480/what-are-the-nuances-of-scope-prototypal-prototypical-inheritance-in-angularjs/14049482#14049482\">my blog-like answer</a> about scopes -- the <strong>directives</strong> section (way at the bottom, just before the Summary section) has a picture of an isolate scope and its parent scope -- the directive scope uses @ for one property and = for another</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14908133/what-is-the-difference-between-vs-and-in-angularjs\">What is the difference between &amp; vs @ and = in angularJS</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "What is the difference between &#39;@&#39; and &#39;=&#39; in directive scope in AngularJS?", "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-directive", "angularjs-scope"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14050195/what-is-the-difference-between-and-in-directive-scope-in-angularjs/14063373#14063373", "question_id": 14050195, "answer_id": 14063373}, {"body": "<p>Even when the scope is local, as in your example, you may access the parent scope through the property <code>$parent</code>.

E.g., from <code>ng-click</code>, filters, etc.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Long answer</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>A controller function is a JavaScript constructor function.  When the constructor function executes (e.g., when a view loads), <code>this</code> (i.e., the \"function context\") is set to the controller object. So in the \"tabs\" controller constructor function, when the addPane function is created</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.addPane = function(pane) { ... }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>it is created on the controller object, not on $scope.  Views cannot see the addPane function -- they only have access to functions defined on $scope.  In other words, in the HTML, this won't work:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a ng-click=\"addPane(newPane)\"&gt;won't work&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the \"tabs\" controller constructor function executes, we have the following:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/PUMuU.png\" alt=\"after tabs controller constructor function\"></p>\n\n<p>The dashed black line indicates prototypal inheritance -- an isolate scope prototypically inherits from <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$rootScope.Scope\">Scope</a>.  (It does not prototypically inherit from the scope in effect where the directive was encountered in the HTML.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, the pane directive's link function wants to communicate with the tabs directive (which really means it needs to affect the tabs isolate $scope in some way).  Events could be used, but another mechanism is to have the pane directive <code>require</code> the tabs controller.  (There appears to be no mechanism for the pane directive to <code>require</code> the tabs $scope.)</p>\n\n<p>So, this begs the question: if we only have access to the tabs controller, how do we get access to the tabs isolate $scope (which is what we really want)?</p>\n\n<p>Well, the red dotted line is the answer.  The addPane() function's \"scope\" (I'm referring to JavaScript's function scope/closures here) gives the function access to the tabs isolate $scope.  I.e., addPane() has access to the \"tabs IsolateScope\" in the diagram above because of a closure that was created when addPane() was defined.  (If we instead defined addPane() on the tabs $scope object, the pane directive would not have access to this function, and hence it would have no way to communicate with the tabs $scope.)</p>\n\n<p>To answer the other part of your question: <code>how does $scope work in controllers?</code>:</p>\n\n<p>Within functions defined on $scope, <code>this</code> is set to \"the $scope in effect where/when the function was called\".  Suppose we have the following HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=\"ParentCtrl\"&gt;\n   &lt;a ng-click=\"logThisAndScope()\"&gt;log \"this\" and $scope&lt;/a&gt; - parent scope\n   &lt;div ng-controller=\"ChildCtrl\"&gt;\n      &lt;a ng-click=\"logThisAndScope()\"&gt;log \"this\" and $scope&lt;/a&gt; - child scope\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the <code>ParentCtrl</code> (Solely) has</p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.logThisAndScope = function() {\n    console.log(this, $scope)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Clicking the first link will show that <code>this</code> and <code>$scope</code> are the same, since \"<em>the scope in effect when the function was called</em>\" is the scope associated with the <code>ParentCtrl</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Clicking the second link will reveal <code>this</code> and <code>$scope</code> are <strong>not</strong> the same, since \"<em>the scope in effect when the function was called</em>\" is the scope associated with the <code>ChildCtrl</code>.  So here, <code>this</code> is set to <code>ChildCtrl</code>'s <code>$scope</code>.  Inside the method, <code>$scope</code> is still the <code>ParentCtrl</code>'s $scope.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/mrajcok/sbZw7/\">Fiddle</a></p>\n\n<p>I try to not use <code>this</code> inside of a function defined on $scope, as it becomes confusing which $scope is being affected, especially considering that ng-repeat, ng-include, ng-switch, and directives can all create their own child scopes.</p>\n", "title": "&#39;this&#39; vs $scope in AngularJS controllers", "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-scope", "this"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11605917/this-vs-scope-in-angularjs-controllers/14168699#14168699", "question_id": 11605917, "answer_id": 14168699}, {"body": "<blockquote>\n  <p>Previous versions of Angular (pre 1.0 RC) allowed you to use this\n  interchangeably with the $scope method, but this is no longer the\n  case.

The same can be done with <code>@staticmethod</code> as is shown in the code below:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>class Date:\n  def __init__(self, month, day, year):\n    self.month = month\n    self.day   = day\n    self.year  = year\n\n\n  def display(self):\n    return \"{0}-{1}-{2}\".format(self.month, self.day, self.year)\n\n\n  @staticmethod\n  def millenium(month, day):\n    return Date(month, day, 2000)\n\nnew_year = Date(1, 1, 2013)               # Creates a new Date object\nmillenium_new_year = Date.millenium(1, 1) # also creates a Date object. \n\n# Proof:\nnew_year.display()           # \"1-1-2013\"\nmillenium_new_year.display() # \"1-1-2000\"\n\nisinstance(new_year, Date) # True\nisinstance(millenium_new_year, Date) # True\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Thus both <code>new_year</code> and <code>millenium_new_year</code> are instances of <code>Date</code> class.</p>\n\n<p>But, if you observe closely, the Factory process is hard-coded to create <code>Date</code> objects no matter what.

So e.g. on Linux library files are usually called <code>libfoo.so</code> but you'd only write <code>-lfoo</code>. On Windows that same file might be called <code>foo.lib</code>, but you'd use the same argument. You might have to add the directory where those files can be found using <code>-L\u2039directory\u203a</code>.

To use the symbols in a separate project, you'd \nneed to include the <code>lib</code> files in the project settings. This is done in the Linker section of the project properties, in <code>Input -&gt; Additional Dependencies</code>. (the path to the <code>lib</code> file should be\nadded in <code>Linker -&gt; General -&gt; Additional Library Directories</code>) When using a third-party library that is provided with a <code>lib</code> file, failure to do so usually results in the error.</p>\n\n<p>It can also happen that you forget to add the file to the compilation, in which case the object file won't be generated. In <strong>gcc</strong> you'd add the files to the command line. In <strong>MSVS</strong> adding the file to the project will make it compile it automatically (albeit files can, manually, be individually excluded from the build).</p>\n\n<p>In Windows programming, the tell-tale sign that you did not link a necessary library is that the name of the unresolved symbol begins with <code>__imp_</code>. Look up the name of the function in the documentation, and it should say which library you need to use.

Let\u2019s make things clarity first.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A. What is symbol?</strong>\nIn short, a symbol is a name. It can be a variable name, a function name, a class name, a typedef name, or anything except those names and signs that belong to C++ language. It is user defined or introduced by a dependency library (another user defined).</p>\n\n<p><strong>B. What is external?</strong>\nIn VC++, every source file (.cpp,.c,etc.) is considered as a translation unit, the compiler compiles one unit at a time, and generate one object file(.obj) for current translation unit. (Note that every header file that this source file included will be preprocessed and will be considered as part of this translation unit)Everything within a translation unit is considered as internal, everything else is considered as external. In C++, you may reference an external symbol by using keywords like: extern, __declspec (dllimport) and so on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>C. What is \u201cresolve\u201d?</strong>\nResolve is a linking-time term. In linking-time, linker attempts to find the external definition for every symbol in object files that cannot find its definition internally. The scope of this searching process including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>All object files that generated in compiling time</li>\n<li>All libraries (.lib) that is either explicitly or implicitly\nspecified as additional dependencies of this building application.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This searching process is called resolve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>D. Finally, why Unresolved External Symbol?</strong>\nIf the linker cannot find the external definition for a symbol that has no definition internally, it reports an Unresolved External Symbol error.</p>\n\n<p><strong>E. Possible causes of LNK2019</strong>: Unresolved External Symbol error.\nWe already know that this error is due to the linker failed to find the definition of external symbols, the possible causes can be sorted as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Definition exists</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For example, if we have a function called foo defined in a.cpp:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int foo()\n{\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In b.cpp we want to call function foo, so we add</p>\n\n<pre><code>void foo();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to declare function foo(), and call it in another function body, say <code>bar()</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>void bar()\n{\n    foo();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now when you build this code you will get a LNK2019 error complaining that foo is unresolved symbol. In this case, we know that foo() has its definition in a.cpp, but different from the one we are calling(different return value). This is the case that definition exists.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Definition does not exist</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If we want to call some functions in a library, but the import library is not added into the additional dependency list (set from: <code>Project | Properties | Configuration Properties | Linker | Input | Additional Dependency</code>) of your project setting. Now the linker will report a LNK2019 since the definition is not exist in current searching scope.</p>\n", "title": "What is an undefined reference/unresolved external symbol error and how do I fix it?", "tags": ["c++", "linker-error", "undefined-reference", "c++-faq", "unresolved-external"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12573816/what-is-an-undefined-reference-unresolved-external-symbol-error-and-how-do-i-fix/29610614#29610614", "question_id": 12573816, "answer_id": 29610614}, {"body": "<h2>Use the linker to help diagnose the error</h2>\n\n<p>Most modern linkers include a verbose option that prints out to varying degrees;</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Link invocation (command line),</li>\n<li>Data on what libraries are included in the link stage,</li>\n<li>The location of the libraries,</li>\n<li>Search paths used.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For gcc and clang; you would typically add <code>-v -Wl,--verbose</code> or <code>-v -Wl,-v</code> to the command line.

A resource is an opaque blob with no inherently meaningful value of its own. A resource is specific to and defined by a certain set of PHP functions or extension. For instance, the Mysql extension <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/mysql.resources.php\">defines two resource types</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are two resource types used in the MySQL module.

Typically these functions allocate certain data in the background and a resource is just a reference which they use to keep track of this data internally.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The \"<strong>... expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given</strong>\" error is typically the result of an unchecked operation that was supposed to create a resource, but returned <code>false</code> instead. For instance, the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php\"><code>fopen</code> function</a> has this description:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Return Values</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Returns a file pointer resource on success, or <code>FALSE</code> on error.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So in this code, <code>$fp</code> will either be a <code>resource(x) of type (stream)</code> or <code>false</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$fp = fopen(...);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you do not check whether the <code>fopen</code> operation succeed or failed and hence whether <code>$fp</code> is a valid resource or <code>false</code> and pass <code>$fp</code> to another function which expects a resource, you may get the above error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$fp   = fopen(...);\n$data = fread($fp, 1024);\n\nWarning: fread() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You always need to error check the return value of functions which are trying to allocate a resource <strong><em>and may fail</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$fp = fopen(...);\n\nif (!$fp) {\n    trigger_error('Failed to allocate resource');\n    exit;\n}\n\n$data = fread($fp, 1024);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Related Errors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12769982/reference-what-does-this-error-mean-in-php/12770072#12770072\">Warning: mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Reference - What does this error mean in PHP?", "tags": ["php", "debugging", "warnings"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12769982/reference-what-does-this-error-mean-in-php/14067623#14067623", "question_id": 12769982, "answer_id": 14067623}, {"body": "<h3>Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_VARIABLE</h3>\n\n<p>Possible scenario</p>\n\n<p>I can't seem to find where my code has went wrong.

That <code>T_VARIABLE</code> thing is called a <code>token</code>. It's the PHP interpreter's way of expressing different fundamental parts of programs. When the interpreter reads in a program, it translates what you've written into a list of tokens. Wherever you put a variable in your program, there is a<code>T_VARIABLE</code> token in the interpreter's list.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://php.net/tokens\"><strong>Good read: List of Parser Tokens</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>So make sure you enable at least <code>E_PARSE</code> in your <code>php.ini</code>.

In this chapter we will develop the basic framework of inductive definitions, and give some examples of their use. An inductive definition consists of a set of <em>rules</em> for deriving <em>judgments</em>, or <em>assertions</em>, of a variety of forms. Judgments are statements about one or more syntactic objects of a specified sort. The rules specify necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of a judgment, and hence fully determine its meaning.</p>\n\n<h3>2.1 Judgments</h3>\n\n<p>We start with the notion of a <em>judgment</em>, or <em>assertion</em> about a syntactic object. We shall make use of many forms of judgment, including examples such as these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>n</em> <strong>nat</strong> \u2014 <em>n</em> is a natural number</li>\n<li><em>n</em> = <em>n1</em> + <em>n2</em> \u2014 <em>n</em> is the sum of <em>n1</em> and <em>n2</em></li>\n<li><em>\u03c4</em> <strong>type</strong> \u2014 <em>\u03c4</em> is a type</li>\n<li><em>e</em> : <em>\u03c4</em> \u2014 expression <em>e</em> has type <em>\u03c4</em></li>\n<li><em>e</em> \u21d3 <em>v</em> \u2014 expression <em>e</em> has value <em>v</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A judgment states that one or more syntactic objects have a property or stand in some relation to one another. The property or relation itself is called a <em>judgment form</em>, and the judgment that an object or objects have that property or stand in that relation is said to be an <em>instance</em> of that judgment form. A judgment form is also called a <em>predicate</em>, and the objects constituting an instance are its <em>subjects</em>.

The basic idea comes from logic: the whole expression is an implication with the top half being the assumptions and the bottom half being the result. That is, if you know that the top expressions are true, you can conclude that the bottom expressions are true as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Symbols</h2>\n\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that some letters have traditional meanings; particularly, \u0393 represents the \"context\" you're in\u2014that is, what the types of other things you've seen are. So something like <code>\u0393 \u22a2 ...</code> means \"the expression <code>...</code> when you know the types of every expression in <code>\u0393</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>\u22a2</code> symbol essentially means that you can prove something. So <code>\u0393 \u22a2 ...</code> is a statement saying \"I can prove <code>...</code> in a context <code>\u0393</code>. These statements are also called type judgements. </p>\n\n<p>Another thing to keep in mind: in math, just like ML and Scala, <code>x : \u03c3</code> means that <code>x</code> has type <code>\u03c3</code>. You can read it just like Haskell's <code>x :: \u03c3</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>What each rule means</h2>\n\n<p>So, knowing this, the first expression becomes easy to understand: if we know that <code>x : \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393</code> (that is, <code>x</code> has some type <code>\u03c3</code> in some context <code>\u0393</code>), then we know that <code>\u0393 \u22a2 x : \u03c3</code> (that is, in <code>\u0393</code>, <code>x</code> has type <code>\u03c3</code>). So really, this isn't telling you anything super-interesting; it just tells you how to use your context.</p>\n\n<p>The other rules are also simple. For example, take <code>[App]</code>. This rule has two conditions: <code>e\u2080</code> is a function from some type <code>\u03c4</code> to some type <code>\u03c4'</code> and <code>e\u2081</code> is a value of type <code>\u03c4</code>. Now you know what type you will get by applying <code>e\u2080</code> to <code>e\u2081</code>! Hopefully this isn't a surprise :).</p>\n\n<p>The next rule has some more new syntax. Particularly, <code>\u0393, x : \u03c4</code> just means the context made up of <code>\u0393</code> and the judgement <code>x : \u03c4</code>. So, if we know that the variable <code>x</code> has a type of <code>\u03c4</code> and the expression <code>e</code> has a type <code>\u03c4'</code>, we also know the type of a function that takes <code>x</code> and returns <code>e</code>. This just tells us what to do if we've figured out what type a function takes and what type it returns, so it shouldn't be surprising either.</p>\n\n<p>The next one just tells you how to handle <code>let</code> statements. If you know that some expression <code>e\u2081</code> has a type <code>\u03c4</code> as long as <code>x</code> has a type <code>\u03c3</code>, then a <code>let</code> expression which locally binds <code>x</code> to a value of type <code>\u03c3</code> will make <code>e\u2081</code> have a type <code>\u03c4</code>. Really, this just tells you that a let statement essentially lets you expand the context with a new binding\u2014which is exactly what <code>let</code> does!</p>\n\n<p>The <code>[Inst]</code> rule deals with sub-typing. It says that if you have a value of type <code>\u03c3'</code> and it is a sub-type of <code>\u03c3</code> (<code>\u2291</code> represents a partial ordering relation) then that expression is <em>also</em> of type <code>\u03c3</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The final rule deals with generalizing types. A quick aside: a free variable is a variable that is not introduced by a let-statement or lambda inside some expression; this expression now depends on the value of the free variable from its context.The rule is saying that if there is some variable <code>\u03b1</code> which is <em>not</em> \"free\" in anything in your context, then it is safe to say that any expression whose type you know <code>e : \u03c3</code> will have that type for <em>any</em> value of <code>\u03b1</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>How to use the rules</h2>\n\n<p>So, now that you understand the symbols, what do you do with these rules? Well, you can use these rules to figure out the type of various values. To do this, look at your expression (say <code>f x y</code>) and find a rule that has a conclusion (the bottom part) that matches your statement. Let's call the thing you're trying to find your \"goal\". In this case, you would look at the rule that ends in <code>e\u2080 e\u2081</code>. When you've found this, you now have to find rules proving everything above the line of this rule. These things generally correspond to the types of sub-expressions, so you're essentially recursing on parts of the expression. You just do this until you finish your proof tree, which gives you a proof of the type of your expression. </p>\n\n<p>So all these rules do is specify exactly\u2014and in the usual mathematically pedantic detail :P\u2014how to figure out the types of expressions.</p>\n\n<p>Now, this should sound familiar if you've ever used Prolog\u2014you're essentially computing the proof tree like a human Prolog interpreter. There is a reason Prolog is called \"logic programming\"! This is also important as the first way I was introduced to the H-M inference algorithm was by implementing it in Prolog. This is actually surprisingly simple and makes what's going on clear. You should certainly try it.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I probably made some mistakes in this explanation and would love it if somebody would point them out. I'll actually be covering this in class in a couple of weeks, so I'll be more confident then :P.</p>\n", "title": "&quot;What part of Milner-Hindley do you not understand?&quot;", "tags": ["haskell", "functional-programming", "lambda-calculus", "hindley-milner", "denotational-semantics"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12532552/what-part-of-milner-hindley-do-you-not-understand/12534737#12534737", "question_id": 12532552, "answer_id": 12534737}, {"body": "<ul>\n<li>The <em>horizontal bar</em> means that \"[above] <strong>implies</strong> [below]\".</li>\n<li>If there are <em>multiple expressions</em> in [above], then consider them <strong>anded</strong> together; all of the [above] must be true in order to guarantee the [below].</li>\n<li><code>:</code> means <strong>has type</strong></li>\n<li><code>\u2208</code> means <strong>is in</strong>.

However, calling your code inside <code>$timeout</code> removes the necessity to call <code>$apply</code>, because $timeout will trigger another <code>$digest</code> cycle on its own, which will, in turn, do all the necessary updating, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>\n\n<p>In short, instead of doing this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>... your controller code...\n\n$http.get('some/url', function(data){\n    $scope.$apply(function(){\n        $scope.mydate = data.mydata;\n    });\n});\n\n... more of your controller code...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>... your controller code...\n\n$http.get('some/url', function(data){\n    $timeout(function(){\n        $scope.mydate = data.mydata;\n    });\n});\n\n... more of your controller code...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Only call <code>$apply</code> when you know the code running it will always be run outside of Angular code (e.g. your call to $apply will happen inside a callback that is called by code outside of your Angular code).</p>\n\n<p>Unless someone is aware of some impactful disadvantage to using <code>$timeout</code> over <code>$apply</code>, I don't see why you couldn't always use <code>$timeout</code> (with zero delay) instead of <code>$apply</code>, as it will do approximately the same thing.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS : Prevent error $digest already in progress when calling $scope.$apply()", "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-scope", "angular-digest"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12729122/angularjs-prevent-error-digest-already-in-progress-when-calling-scope-apply/21269546#21269546", "question_id": 12729122, "answer_id": 21269546}, {"body": "<p>Found this: <a href=\"https://coderwall.com/p/ngisma\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://coderwall.com/p/ngisma</a> where Nathan Walker (near bottom of page) suggests a decorator in $rootScope to create func 'safeApply', code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>yourAwesomeModule.config([\n  '$provide', function($provide) {\n    return $provide.decorator('$rootScope', [\n      '$delegate', function($delegate) {\n        $delegate.safeApply = function(fn) {\n          var phase = $delegate.$$phase;\n          if (phase === \"$apply\" || phase === \"$digest\") {\n            if (fn &amp;&amp; typeof fn === 'function') {\n              fn();\n            }\n          } else {\n            $delegate.$apply(fn);\n          }\n        };\n        return $delegate;\n      }\n    ]);\n  }\n]);\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "AngularJS : Prevent error $digest already in progress when calling $scope.$apply()", "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-scope", "angular-digest"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12729122/angularjs-prevent-error-digest-already-in-progress-when-calling-scope-apply/23021562#23021562", "question_id": 12729122, "answer_id": 23021562}, {"body": "<p>Many of the answers here contain good advices but can also lead to confusion.

There are about 2 to the power 8093729.5 different ways to choose 1 million 8-digit numbers with duplicates allowed and order unimportant, so a machine with only 1 million bytes of RAM doesn't have enough states to represent all the possibilities. But 1M (less 2k for TCP/IP) is 1022*1024*8 = 8372224 bits, so a solution is possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 1, initial solution</strong></p>\n\n<p>This approach needs a little more than 1M, I'll refine it to fit into 1M later.</p>\n\n<p>I'll store a compact sorted list of numbers in the range 0 to 99999999 as a sequence of sublists of 7-bit numbers. The first sublist holds numbers from 0 to 127, the second sublist holds numbers from 128 to 255, etc. 100000000/128 is exactly 781250, so 781250 such sublists will be needed.</p>\n\n<p>Each sublist consists of a 2-bit sublist header followed by a sublist body. The sublist body takes up 7 bits per sublist entry. The sublists are all concatenated together, and the format makes it possible to tell where one sublist ends and the next begins. The total storage required for a fully populated list is 2*781250 + 7*1000000 = 8562500 bits, which is about 1.021 M-bytes.</p>\n\n<p>The 4 possible sublist header values are:</p>\n\n<p><strong>00</strong> Empty sublist, nothing follows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>01</strong> Singleton, there is only one entry in the sublist and and next 7 bits hold it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10</strong> The sublist holds at least 2 distinct numbers. The entries are stored in non-decreasing order, except that the last entry is less than or equal to the first. This allows the end of the sublist to be identified. For example, the numbers 2,4,6 would be stored as (4,6,2). The numbers 2,2,3,4,4 would be stored as (2,3,4,4,2).</p>\n\n<p><strong>11</strong> The sublist holds 2 or more repetitions of a single number. The next 7 bits give the number. Then come zero or more 7-bit entries with the value 1, followed by a 7-bit entry with the value 0. The length of the sublist body dictates the number of repetitions. For example, the numbers 12,12 would be stored as (12,0), the numbers 12,12,12 would be stored as (12,1,0), 12,12,12,12 would be (12,1,1,0) and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I start off with an empty list, read a bunch of numbers in and store them as 32 bit integers, sort the new numbers in place (using heapsort, probably) and then merge them into a new compact sorted list. Repeat until there are no more numbers to read, then walk the compact list once more to generate the output.</p>\n\n<p>The line below represents memory just before the start of the list merge operation. The \"O\"s are the region that hold the sorted 32-bit integers. The \"X\"s are the region that hold the old compact list. The \"=\" signs are the expansion room for the compact list, 7 bits for each integer in the \"O\"s. The \"Z\"s are other random overhead.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ZZZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO==========XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The merge routine starts reading at the leftmost \"O\" and at the leftmost \"X\", and starts writing at the leftmost \"=\". The write pointer doesn't catch the compact list read pointer until all of the new integers are merged, because both pointers advance 2 bits for each sublist and 7 bits for each entry in the old compact list, and there is enough extra room for the 7-bit entries for the new numbers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2, cramming it into 1M</strong></p>\n\n<p>To Squeeze the solution above into 1M, I need to make the compact list format a bit more compact. I'll get rid of one of the sublist types, so that there will be just 3 different possible sublist header values. Then I can use \"00\", \"01\" and \"1\" as the sublist header values and save a few bits. The sublist types are:</p>\n\n<p>A Empty sublist, nothing follows.</p>\n\n<p>B Singleton, there is only one entry in the sublist and and next 7 bits hold it.</p>\n\n<p>C The sublist holds at least 2 distinct numbers. The entries are stored in non-decreasing order, except that the last entry is less than or equal to the first. This allows the end of the sublist to be identified. For example, the numbers 2,4,6 would be stored as (4,6,2). The numbers 2,2,3,4,4 would be stored as (2,3,4,4,2).</p>\n\n<p>D The sublist consists of 2 or more repetitions of a single number.</p>\n\n<p>My 3 sublist header values will be \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\", so I need a way to represent D-type sublists.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose I have the C-type sublist header followed by 3 entries, such as \"C[17][101][58]\". This can't be part of a valid C-type sublist as described above, since the third entry is less than the second but more than the first. I can use this type of construct to represent a D-type sublist. In bit terms, anywhere I have \"C{00?????}{1??????}{01?????}\" is an impossible C-type sublist. I'll use this to represent a sublist consisting of 3 or more repetitions of a single number. The first two 7-bit words encode the number (the \"N\" bits below) and are followed by zero or more {0100001} words followed by a {0100000} word.</p>\n\n<pre><code>For example, 3 repetitions: \"C{00NNNNN}{1NN0000}{0100000}\", 4 repetitions: \"C{00NNNNN}{1NN0000}{0100001}{0100000}\", and so on.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That just leaves lists that hold exactly 2 repetitions of a single number. I'll represent those with another impossible C-type sublist pattern: \"C{0??????}{11?????}{10?????}\". There's plenty of room for the 7 bits of the number in the first 2 words, but this pattern is longer than the sublist that it represents, which makes things a bit more complex. The five question-marks at the end can be considered not part of the pattern, so I have: \"C{0NNNNNN}{11N????}10\" as my pattern, with the number to be repeated stored in the \"N\"s. That's 2 bits too long.</p>\n\n<p>I'll have to borrow 2 bits and pay them back from the 4 unused bits in this pattern. When reading, on encountering \"C{0NNNNNN}{11N00AB}10\", output 2 instances of the number in the \"N\"s, overwrite the \"10\" at the end with bits A and B, and rewind the read pointer by 2 bits. Destructive reads are ok for this algorithm, since each compact list gets walked only once.</p>\n\n<p>When writing a sublist of 2 repetitions of a single number, write \"C{0NNNNNN}11N00\" and set the borrowed bits counter to 2. At every write where the borrowed bits counter is non-zero, it is decremented for each bit written and \"10\" is written when the counter hits zero. So the next 2 bits written will go into slots A and B, and then the \"10\" will get dropped onto the end.</p>\n\n<p>With 3 sublist header values represented by \"00\", \"01\" and \"1\", I can assign \"1\" to the most popular sublist type. I'll need a small table to map sublist header values to sublist types, and I'll need an occurrence counter for each sublist type so that I know what the best sublist header mapping is.</p>\n\n<p>The worst case minimal representation of a fully populated compact list occurs when all the sublist types are equally popular. In that case I save 1 bit for every 3 sublist headers, so the list size is 2*781250 + 7*1000000 - 781250/3 = 8302083.3 bits. Rounding up to a 32 bit word boundary, thats 8302112 bits, or 1037764 bytes.</p>\n\n<p>1M minus the 2k for TCP/IP state and buffers is 1022*1024 = 1046528 bytes, leaving me 8764 bytes to play with.</p>\n\n<p>But what about the process of changing the sublist header mapping ? In the memory map below, \"Z\" is random overhead, \"=\" is free space, \"X\" is the compact list.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ZZZ=====XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Start reading at the leftmost \"X\" and start writing at the leftmost \"=\" and work right. When it's done the compact list will be a little shorter and it will be at the wrong end of memory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ZZZXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX=======\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So then I'll need to shunt it to the right:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ZZZ=======XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the header mapping change process, up to 1/3 of the sublist headers will be changing from 1-bit to 2-bit. In the worst case these will all be at the head of the list, so I'll need at least 781250/3 bits of free storage before I start, which takes me back to the memory requirements of the previous version of the compact list :(</p>\n\n<p>To get around that, I'll split the 781250 sublists into 10 sublist groups of 78125 sublists each.

I hope somebody would find the result useful (or at least interesting).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 1: Initial data structure, rough compression approach, basic results</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let's do some simple math: we have 1M (1048576 bytes) of RAM initially available to store 10^6 8 digit decimal numbers. [0;99999999]. So to store one number 27 bits are needed (taking the assumption that unsigned numbers will be used). Thus, to store a raw stream ~3.5M of RAM will be needed. Somebody already said it doesn't seem to be feasible, but I would say the task can be solved if the input is \"good enough\". Basically, the idea is to compress the input data with compression factor 0.29 or higher and do sorting in a proper manner.</p>\n\n<p>Let's solve the compression issue first.

If we give the combination 0,0,0,....,0 the code 0, and 0,0,0,...,1 the code 1, and 99999999, 99999999, ... 99999999 the code N, what is N? In other words, how big is the result space?</p>\n\n<p>Well, one way to think about this is noticing that this is a bijection of the problem of finding the number of monotonic paths in an N x M grid, where N = 1,000,000 and M = 100,000,000. In other words, if you have a grid that is 1,000,000 wide and 100,000,000 tall, how many shortest paths from the bottom left to the top right are there? Shortest paths of course require you only ever either move right or up (if you were to move down or left you would be undoing previously accomplished progress). To see how this is a bijection of our number sorting problem, observe the following:</p>\n\n<p>You can imagine any horizontal leg in our path as a number in our ordering, where the Y location of the leg represents the value.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/aJp4b.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>So if the path simply moves to the right all the way to the end, then jumps all the way to the top, that is equivalent to the ordering 0,0,0,...,0. if it instead begins by jumping all the way to the top and then moves to the right 1,000,000 times, that is equivalent to 99999999,99999999,..., 99999999. A path where it moves right once, then up once, then right one, then up once, etc to the very end (then necessarily jumps all the way to the top), is equivalent to 0,1,2,3,...,999999.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily for us this problem has already been solved, such a grid has (N + M) Choose (M) paths:</p>\n\n<p>(1,000,000 + 100,000,000) Choose (100,000,000) ~= 2.27 * 10^2436455</p>\n\n<p>N thus equals 2.27 * 10^2436455, and so the code 0 represents 0,0,0,...,0 and the code 2.27 * 10^2436455 and some change represents 99999999,99999999,..., 99999999.</p>\n\n<p>In order to store all the numbers from 0 to 2.27 * 10^2436455 you need lg2 (2.27 * 10^2436455) = 8.0937 * 10^6 bits.</p>\n\n<p>1 megabyte = 8388608 bits > 8093700 bits</p>\n\n<p>So it appears that we at least actually have enough room to store the result! Now of course the interesting bit is doing the sorting as the numbers stream in. Not sure the best approach to this is given we have 294908 bits remaining. I imagine an interesting technique would be to at each point assume that that is is the entire ordering, finding the code for that ordering, and then as you receive a new number going back and updating the previous code.

They run <em>robots</em> that crawl the HTML on web pages, collecting information along the way. They keep interesting words and look for other links to other pages (these links, the amount of them and the number of them come into play with SEO). </p>\n\n<h2>So why don't search engines deal with javascript sites?</h2>\n\n<p>The answer has to do with the fact that the search engine robots work through headless browsers and they most often do <em>not</em> have a javascript rendering engine to render the javascript of a page. This works for most pages as most static pages don't care about JavaScript rendering their page, as their content is already available.</p>\n\n<h2>What can be done about it?</h2>\n\n<p>Luckily, crawlers of the larger sites have started to implement a mechanism that allows us to make our JavaScript sites crawlable, but it <strong>requires us to implement a change to our site</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If we change our <code>hashPrefix</code> to be <code>#!</code> instead of simply <code>#</code>, then modern search engines will change the request to use <code>_escaped_fragment_</code> instead of <code>#!</code>. (With HTML5 mode, i.e. where we have links without the hash prefix, we can implement this same feature by looking at the <code>User Agent</code> header in our backend).</p>\n\n<p>That is to say, instead of a request from a normal browser that looks like:</p>\n\n<p><code>http://www.ng-newsletter.com/#!/signup/page</code></p>\n\n<p>A search engine will search the page with:</p>\n\n<p><code>http://www.ng-newsletter.com/?_escaped_fragment_=/signup/page</code></p>\n\n<p>We can set the hash prefix of our Angular apps using a built-in method from <code>ngRoute</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('myApp', [])\n.config(['$location', function($location) {\n  $location.hashPrefix('!');\n}]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And, if we're using <code>html5Mode</code>, we will need to implement this using the meta tag:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;meta name=\"fragment\" content=\"!\"&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Reminder, we can set the <code>html5Mode()</code> with the <code>$location</code> service:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('myApp', [])\n.config(['$location', \nfunction($location) {\n  $location.html5Mode(true);\n}]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Handling the search engine</h2>\n\n<p>We have a lot of opportunities to determine how we'll deal with actually delivering content to search engines as static HTML. We can host a backend ourselves, we can use a service to host a back-end for us, we can use a proxy to deliver the content, etc. Let's look at a few options:</p>\n\n<h3>Self-hosted</h3>\n\n<p>We can write a service to handle dealing with crawling our own site using a headless browser, like phantomjs or zombiejs, taking a snapshot of the page with rendered data and storing it as HTML. Whenever we see the query string <code>?_escaped_fragment_</code> in a search request, we can deliver the static HTML snapshot we took of the page instead of the pre-rendered page through only JS. This requires us to have a backend that delivers our pages with conditional logic in the middle. We can use something like <a href=\"https://prerender.io/\">prerender.io's</a> backend as a starting point to run this ourselves. Of course, we still need to handle the proxying and the snippet handling, but it's a good start.</p>\n\n<h3>With a paid service</h3>\n\n<p>The easiest and the fastest way to get content into search engine is to use a service <a href=\"http://www.brombone.com/\">Brombone</a>, <a href=\"http://getseojs.com/\">seo.js</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seo4ajax.com/\">seo4ajax</a>, and <a href=\"https://prerender.io/\">prerender.io</a> are good examples of these that will host the above content rendering for you. This is a good option for the times when we don't want to deal with running a server/proxy. Also, it's usually super quick.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about Angular and SEO, we wrote an extensive tutorial on it at <a href=\"http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/serious-angular-seo.html\">http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/serious-angular-seo.html</a> <strong>and</strong> we detailed it even more in our book <strong>ng-book: The Complete Book on AngularJS</strong>.

Say you have a page containing tabs. The tabs hide and show content, and the content is inserted dynamically, either using AJAX or by simply setting display:none and display:block to hide and show the correct tab content.</p>\n\n<p>When the tabs are clicked, use pushState to update the url in the address bar. When the page is rendered, use the value in the address bar to determine which tab to show. Angular routing will do this for you automatically.</p>\n\n<h2>Precomposition</h2>\n\n<p>There are two ways to hit a PushState Single Page App (SPA)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Via PushState, where the user clicks a PushState link and the content is AJAXed in.</li>\n<li>By hitting the URL directly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The initial hit on the site will involve hitting the URL directly. Subsequent hits will simply AJAX in content as the PushState updates the URL.</p>\n\n<p>Crawlers harvest links from a page then add them to a queue for later processing. This means that for a crawler, every hit on the server is a direct hit, they don't navigate via Pushstate.</p>\n\n<p>Precomposition bundles the initial payload into the first response from the server, possibly as a JSON object. This allows the Search Engine to render the page without executing the AJAX call.</p>\n\n<p>There is some evidence to suggest that Google might not execute AJAX requests.

If a link has a valid href attribute, the new URL can be indexed. There's nothing more to do.</p>\n\n<p>If clicking a link in addition triggers a pushState call, the site can be navigated by the user via PushState.</p>\n\n<h2>Search Engine Support for PushState URLs</h2>\n\n<p>PushState is currently supported by Google and Bing.</p>\n\n<h3>Google</h3>\n\n<p>Here's Matt Cutts responding to Paul Irish's question about PushState for SEO:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/yiAF9VdvRPw\">http://youtu.be/yiAF9VdvRPw</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is Google announcing full JavaScript support for the spider:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.de/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html\">http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.de/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html</a></p>\n\n<p>The upshot is that Google supports PushState and will index PushState URLs.</p>\n\n<p>See also Google webmaster tools' fetch as Googlebot. You will see your JavaScript (including Angular) is executed. </p>\n\n<h3>Bing</h3>\n\n<p>Here is Bing's announcement of support for pretty PushState URLs dated March 2013:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2013/03/21/search-engine-optimization-best-practices-for-ajax-urls/\">http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2013/03/21/search-engine-optimization-best-practices-for-ajax-urls/</a></p>\n\n<h2>Don't use HashBangs #!</h2>\n\n<p>Hashbang urls were an ugly stopgap requiring the developer to provide a pre-rendered version of the site at a special location. They still work, but you don't need to use them.</p>\n\n<p>Hashbang URLs look like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>domain.com/#!path/to/resource</code></p>\n\n<p>This would be paired with a metatag like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;meta name=\"fragment\" content=\"!\"&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Google will not index them in this form, but will instead pull a static version of the site from the _escaped_fragments_ URL and index that. </p>\n\n<p>Pushstate URLs look like any ordinary URL:</p>\n\n<p><code>domain.com/path/to/resource</code></p>\n\n<p>The difference is that Angular handles them for you by intercepting the change to document.location dealing with it in JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to use PushState URLs (and you probably do) take out all the old hash style URLs and metatags and simply enable HTML5 mode in your config block.</p>\n\n<h2>Testing your site</h2>\n\n<p>Google Webmaster tools now contains a tool which will allow you to fetch a URL as google, and render JavaScript as Google renders it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch\">https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/googlebot-fetch</a></p>\n\n<h2>Generating PushState URLs in Angular</h2>\n\n<p>To generate real URLs in Angular, rather than # prefixed ones, set HTML5 mode on your $locationProvider object.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$locationProvider.html5Mode(true);\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Server Side</h2>\n\n<p>Since you are using real URLs, you will need to ensure the same template (plus some precomposed content) gets shipped by your server for all valid URLs. How you do this will vary depending on your server architecture.</p>\n\n<h2>Sitemap</h2>\n\n<p>Your app may use unusual forms of navigation, for example hover or scroll. To ensure Google is able to drive your app, I would probably suggest creating a sitemap, a simple list of all the urls your app responds to. You can place this at the default location (/sitemap or /sitemap.xml), or tell Google about it using webmaster tools.</p>\n\n<p>It's a good idea to have a sitemap anyway.</p>\n\n<h2>Browser support</h2>\n\n<p>Pushstate works in IE10. In older browsers, Angular will automatically fall back to hash style URLs</p>\n\n<h2>A demo page</h2>\n\n<p>The following content is rendered using a pushstate URL with precomposition:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://html5.gingerhost.com/london\">http://html5.gingerhost.com/london</a></p>\n\n<p>As can be verified, at <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=ginger+London&#39;s+ancient+core\">this link</a>, the content is indexed and is appearing in Google. </p>\n\n<h2>Serving 404 and 301 Header status codes</h2>\n\n<p>Because the search engine will always hit your server for every request, you can serve header status codes from your server and expect Google to see them.</p>\n", "title": "How do search engines deal with AngularJS applications?", "tags": ["html5", "angularjs", "seo", "search-engine", "google-search"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13499040/how-do-search-engines-deal-with-angularjs-applications/23245379#23245379", "question_id": 13499040, "answer_id": 23245379}, {"body": "<p>Use something like PreRender, it makes static pages of your site so search engines can index it.</p>\n\n<p>Here you can find out for what platforms it is available: <a href=\"https://prerender.io/documentation/install-middleware#asp-net\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://prerender.io/documentation/install-middleware#asp-net</a></p>\n", "title": "How do search engines deal with AngularJS applications?", "tags": ["html5", "angularjs", "seo", "search-engine", "google-search"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13499040/how-do-search-engines-deal-with-angularjs-applications/28671681#28671681", "question_id": 13499040, "answer_id": 28671681}, {"body": "<p>Crawlers (or bots) are designed to crawl HTML content of web pages but due to AJAX operations for asynchronous data fetching, this became a problem as it takes sometime to render page and show dynamic content on it.

In Swift I used lazy variables:</p>\n\n<pre><code>lazy var centerYInflection:NSLayoutConstraint = {\n       let temp =  self.view.constraints.filter({ $0.firstItem is MNGStarRating }).filter ( { $0.secondItem is UIWebView }).filter({ $0.firstAttribute == .CenterY }).first\n        return temp!\n}()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After some experimentation I noted that one MUST obtain the constraint from the view <strong>ABOVE</strong> (aka the superview) the two views where the constraint is defined. In the example below (both MNGStarRating and UIWebView are the two types of items I am creating a constraint between, and they are subviews within self.view).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Filter Chaining</strong></p>\n\n<p>I take advantage of Swift's filter method to separate the desired constraint that will serve as the inflection point. One could also get much more complicated but filter does a nice job here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Animating Constraints Using Swift</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nota Bene - This example is the storyboard/code solution and assumes\n  one has made default constraints in the storyboard. One can then\n  animate the changes using code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming you create a property to filter with accurate criteria and get to a specific inflection point for your animation (of course you could also filter for an array and loop through if you need multiple constraints):</p>\n\n<pre><code>lazy var centerYInflection:NSLayoutConstraint = {\n    let temp =  self.view.constraints.filter({ $0.firstItem is MNGStarRating }).filter ( { $0.secondItem is UIWebView }).filter({ $0.firstAttribute == .CenterY }).first\n    return temp!\n}()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>....</p>\n\n<p>Sometime later...</p>\n\n<pre><code>@IBAction func toggleRatingView (sender:AnyObject){\n\n    let aPointAboveScene = -(max(UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.width,UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.height) * 2.0)\n\n    self.view.layoutIfNeeded()\n\n\n    //Use any animation you want, I like the bounce in springVelocity...\n    UIView.animateWithDuration(1.0, delay: 0.0, usingSpringWithDamping: 0.3, initialSpringVelocity: 0.75, options: [.CurveEaseOut], animations: { () -&gt; Void in\n\n        //I use the frames to determine if the view is on-screen\n        if CGRectContainsRect(self.view.frame, self.ratingView.frame) {\n\n            //in frame ~ animate away\n            //I play a sound to give the animation some life\n\n            self.centerYInflection.constant = aPointAboveScene\n            self.centerYInflection.priority = UILayoutPriority(950)\n\n        } else {\n\n            //I play a different sound just to keep the user engaged\n            //out of frame ~ animate into scene\n            self.centerYInflection.constant = 0\n            self.centerYInflection.priority = UILayoutPriority(950)\n            self.view.setNeedsLayout()\n            self.view.layoutIfNeeded()\n         }) { (success) -&gt; Void in\n\n            //do something else\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>The many wrong turns</h2>\n\n<p>These notes are really a set of tips that I wrote for myself. I did all the don'ts personally and painfully. Hopefully this guide can spare others.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Watch out for zPositioning. Sometimes when nothing is apparently\nhappening, you should hide some of the other views or use the view\ndebugger to locate your animated view. I've even found cases where a User Defined Runtime\nAttribute was lost in a storyboard's xml and led to the animated\nview being covered (while working).</p></li>\n<li><p>Always take a minute to read the documentation (new and old), Quick\nHelp, and headers. Apple keeps making a lot of changes to better\nmanage AutoLayout constraints (see stack views). Or at least the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/LayoutUsingStackViews.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH11-SW1\" rel=\"nofollow\">AutoLayout Cookbook</a>. Keep in mind that sometimes the best solutions are in the older documentation/videos.</p></li>\n<li><p>Play around with the values in the animation and consider using\nother animateWithDuration variants.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't hardcode specific layout values as criteria for determining\nchanges to other constants, instead use values that allow you to\ndetermine the location of the view. <code>CGRectContainsRect</code> is one\nexample</p></li>\n<li>If needed, don't hesitate to use the layout margins associated with\na view participating in the constraint definition \n<code>let viewMargins = self.webview.layoutMarginsGuide</code>: is on example</li>\n<li>Don't do work you don't have to do, all views with constraints on the\nstoryboard have constraints attached to the property\nself.viewName.constraints</li>\n<li>Change your priorities for any constraints to less than 1000. I set\nmine to 250 (low) or 750 (high) on the storyboard; (if you try to change a 1000 priority to anything in code then the app will crash because 1000 is required)</li>\n<li>Consider not immediately trying to use activateConstraints and\ndeactivateConstraints (they have their place but when just learning or if you are using a storyboard using these probably means your doing too much ~ they do have a place though as seen below)</li>\n<li>Consider not using addConstraints / removeConstraints unless you are\nreally adding a new constraint in code. I found that most times I\nlayout the views in the storyboard with desired constraints (placing\nthe view offscreen), then in code, I  animate the constraints previously created in the storyboard to move the view around.</li>\n<li>I spent a lot of wasted time building up constraints with the new\nNSAnchorLayout class and subclasses. These work just fine but it\ntook me a while to realize that all the constraints that I needed\nalready existed in the storyboard. If you build constraints in code\nthen most certainly use this method to aggregate your constraints:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Quick Sample Of Solutions to AVOID when using Storyboards</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>private var _nc:[NSLayoutConstraint] = []\n    lazy var newConstraints:[NSLayoutConstraint] = {\n\n        if !(self._nc.isEmpty) {\n            return self._nc\n        }\n\n        let viewMargins = self.webview.layoutMarginsGuide\n        let minimumScreenWidth = min(UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.width,UIScreen.mainScreen().bounds.height)\n\n        let centerY = self.ratingView.centerYAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(self.webview.centerYAnchor)\n        centerY.constant = -1000.0\n        centerY.priority = (950)\n        let centerX =  self.ratingView.centerXAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(self.webview.centerXAnchor)\n        centerX.priority = (950)\n\n        if let buttonConstraints = self.originalRatingViewConstraints?.filter({\n\n            ($0.firstItem is UIButton || $0.secondItem is UIButton )\n        }) {\n            self._nc.appendContentsOf(buttonConstraints)\n\n        }\n\n        self._nc.append( centerY)\n        self._nc.append( centerX)\n\n        self._nc.append (self.ratingView.leadingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(viewMargins.leadingAnchor, constant: 10.0))\n        self._nc.append (self.ratingView.trailingAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchor(viewMargins.trailingAnchor, constant: 10.0))\n        self._nc.append (self.ratingView.widthAnchor.constraintEqualToConstant((minimumScreenWidth - 20.0)))\n        self._nc.append (self.ratingView.heightAnchor.constraintEqualToConstant(200.0))\n\n        return self._nc\n    }()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you forget one of these tips or the more simple ones such as where to add the layoutIfNeeded, most likely nothing will happen: In which case you may have a half baked solution like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>NB - Take a moment to read the AutoLayout Section Below and the\n  original guide.

The basic concept is the same for both iOS and OS X, but there are a few minor differences.</p>\n\n<p>In an iOS app, your code would look something like the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[containerView layoutIfNeeded]; // Ensures that all pending layout operations have been completed\n[UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^{\n     // Make all constraint changes here\n     [containerView layoutIfNeeded]; // Forces the layout of the subtree animation block and then captures all of the frame changes\n}];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In OS X, use the following code when using layer-backed animations:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[containterView layoutIfNeeded];\nNSAnimationContext runAnimationGroup:^(NSAnimationContext *context) {\n     [context setAllowsImplicitAnimation: YES];\n     // Make all constraint changes here\n     [containerView layoutIfNeeded];\n}];\nWhen you aren\u2019t using layer-backed animations, you must animate the constant using the constraint\u2019s animator:\n\n[[constraint animator] setConstant:42];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For those who learn better visually check out this early <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2012-232/\" rel=\"nofollow\">video from Apple</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Pay Close Attention</h2>\n\n<p>Often in documentation there are small notes or pieces of code that lead to bigger ideas.

IMHO, CoffeeScript provides readability for humans, but TypeScript also provides deep readability for <em>tools</em> through its optional static typing (see this <a href=\"http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhyDoesTypeScriptHaveToBeTheAnswerToAnything.aspx\">recent blog post</a> for a little more critique). There's also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_%28programming_language%29\">Dart</a> but that's a full on replacement for JavaScript (though it <a href=\"http://www.dartlang.org/docs/dart-up-and-running/contents/ch04-tools-dart2js.html\">can produce JavaScript code</a>)</p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>As an example, here's some TypeScript (you can play with this in the <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/\">TypeScript Playground</a>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Greeter {\n    greeting: string;\n    constructor (message: string) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    greet() {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    }\n}  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's the JavaScript it would produce</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Greeter = (function () {\n    function Greeter(message) {\n        this.greeting = message;\n    }\n    Greeter.prototype.greet = function () {\n        return \"Hello, \" + this.greeting;\n    };\n    return Greeter;\n})();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how the TypeScript defines the type of member variables and class method parameters.

It is not the early days anymore. TypeScript is finding a lot more adoption now with several popular frameworks being written in TypeScript. The reasons why you should choose TypeScript instead of JavaScript are many now. </p>\n\n<h1>Relation to JavaScript</h1>\n\n<p>JavaScript is standardized through the ECMAScript standards. Not all browsers in use support all features of newer ECMAScript standards (see this <a href=\"https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/\">table</a>). TypeScript supports new ECMAScript standards and compiles them to (older) ECMAScript targets of your choosing (current targets are 3, 5 and 6 [a.k.a. 2015]). This means that you can use features of ES2015 and beyond, like modules, lambda functions, classes, the spread operator, destructuring, today. It also adds type support of course, which is not part of any ECMAScript standard and may likely never be due to the interpreted nature instead of compiled nature of JavaScript. The type system of TypeScript is relatively rich and includes: interfaces, enums, hybrid types, generics, union and intersection types, access modifiers and much more. The <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org\">official website</a> of TypeScript gives an overview of these features.</p>\n\n<h1>Relation to other JavaScript targeting languages</h1>\n\n<p>TypeScript has a unique philosophy compared to other languages that compile to JavaScript. JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code; TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. You can almost rename your <code>.js</code> files to <code>.ts</code> files and start using TypeScript. TypeScript files are compiled to readable JavaScript, so that migration back is possible and understanding the compiled TypeScript is not hard at all. This way TypeScript builds on the successes of JavaScript while improving on its weaknesses. </p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, you have future proof tools that take modern ECMAScript standards and compile it down to older JavaScript versions with Babel being the most popular one. On the other hand, you have languages that may totally differ from JavaScript which target JavaScript, like Coffeescript, Clojure, Dart, Elm, Haxe, ScalaJs, and a whole host more (see this <a href=\"https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS\">list</a>). These languages, though they might be better then where JavaScript's future might ever lead, run a greater risk of not finding enough adoption for their futures to be guaranteed. You might also have more trouble finding experienced developers for some of these languages, though the ones you will find can often be more enthusiastic. Interop with JavaScript can also be a bit more involved, since they are farther removed from what JavaScript actually is.</p>\n\n<p>TypeScript sits in between these two extremes, thus balancing the risk. TypeScript is not a risky choice by any standard. It takes very little effort to get used to if you are known to JavaScript, since it is not a completely different language, has excellent JavaScript interoperability support and it has seen a lot of adoption recently.</p>\n\n<h1>Optionally static typing and type inference</h1>\n\n<p>JavaScript is dynamically typed. This means JavaScript does not know what type a variable is until it is actually instantiated at run-time. This also means that it may be too late. TypeScript adds type support to JavaScript. Bugs that are caused by false assumptions of some variable being of a certain type can be completely eradicated if you play your cards right; how strict you type your code or if you type your code at all is up to you. </p>\n\n<p>TypeScript makes typing a bit easier and a lot less explicit by the usage of type inference. For example: <code>var x = \"hello\"</code> in TypeScript is the same as <code>var x : string = \"hello\"</code>. The type is simply inferred from its use. Even it you don't explicitly type the types, they are still there to save you from doing something which otherwise would result in a run-time error. </p>\n\n<p>TypeScript is optionally typed by default. For example <code>function divideByTwo(x) { return  x / 2 }</code> is a valid function in TypeScript which can be called with <em>any</em> kind of parameter, even though calling it with a string will obviously result in a <em>runtime</em> error. Just like you are used to in JavaScript. This works, because when no type was explicitly assigned and the type could not be inferred, like in the divideByTwo example, TypeScript will implicitly assign the type <code>any</code>. This means the divideByTwo function's type signature automatically becomes <code>function divideByTwo(x : any) : any</code>.  There is a compiler flag to disallow this behavior: <code>--noImplicitAny</code>. Enabling this flag gives you a greater degree of safety, but also means you will have to do more typing. </p>\n\n<p>Types have a cost associated with them. First of all there is a learning curve, and second of all, of course, it will cost you a bit more time to set up a codebase using proper strict typing too. In my experience, these costs are totally worth it on any serious codebase you are sharing with others. <a href=\"http://macbeth.cs.ucdavis.edu/lang_study.pdf\">A Large Scale Study of Programming Languages and Code Quality in Github</a> suggests that <em>\"that statically typed languages in general are less defect prone than the dynamic types, and that strong typing is better than weak typing in the same regard.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that this very same paper finds that TypeScript is less error prone then JavaScript:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For those with positive coefficients we can expect that the language\n  is associated with, ceteris paribus, a greater number of defect fixes.\n  These languages include C, C++, <em>JavaScript</em>, Objective-C, Php, and\n  Python. The languages Clojure, Haskell, Ruby, Scala, and <em>TypeScript</em>,\n  all have negative coefficients implying that these languages are less\n  likely than the average to result in defect fixing commits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Enhanced IDE support</h1>\n\n<p>The development experience with TypeScript is a great improvement over JavaScript. The IDE is informed in real-time by the TypeScript compiler on its rich type information. This gives a couple of major advantages. For example, with TypeScript you can safely do refactorings like renames across your entire codebase. Through code completion you can get inline help on whatever functions a library might offer. No more need to remember them or look them up in online references. Compilation errors are reported directly in the IDE with a red squiggly line while you are busy coding. All in all this allows for a significant gain in productivity compared to working with JavaScript. One can spend more time coding and less time debugging.</p>\n\n<p>There is a wide range of IDEs that have excellent support for TypeScript, like Visual Studio &amp; VS code, Atom, Sublime, and IntelliJ/WebStorm. </p>\n\n<h1>Strict null checks</h1>\n\n<p><em>Note</em>: The following feature will be part of the upcoming TypeScript 2.0 release. There are many exciting new features in this release, but I would like to highlight this one in particular since it is such a big improvement over JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Runtime errors of the form <code>cannot read property 'x' of undefined</code> or <code>undefined is not a function</code> are very commonly caused by bugs in JavaScript code. Out of the box TypeScript already reduces the probability of these kinds of errors occurring, since one cannot use a variable that is not known to the TypeScript compiler (with the exception of properties of <code>any</code> typed variables). It is still possible though to mistakenly utilize a variable that is set to <code>undefined</code>. However, with the upcoming 2.0 version of TypeScript you can eliminate these kinds of errors alltogether through the usage of non-nullable types. This works as follows: </p>\n\n<p>With strict null checks enabled (<code>--strictNullChecks</code> compiler flag) the TypeScript compiler will not allow <code>undefined</code> to be assigned to a variable unless you explicitly declare it to be of nullable type. For example, <code>let x : number = undefined</code> will result in a compile error. This fits perfectly with type theory, since <code>undefined</code> is not a number. One can define <code>x</code> to be a sum type of <code>number</code> and <code>undefined</code> to correct this: <code>let x : number | undefined = undefined</code>. The short hand notation is <code>let x : number? = undefined</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Once a type is known to be nullable, meaning it is of a type that can also be of the value <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, the TypeScript compiler can determine through control flow based type analysis whether or not your code can safely use a variable or not. In other words when you check a variable is <code>undefined</code> through for example an <code>if</code> statement the TypeScript compiler will infer that the type in that branch of your code's control flow is not anymore nullable and therefore can safely be used. Here is a simple example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let x : number?;\nif (x !== undefined) x += 1; // this line will compile, because x is checked.\nx += 1; // this line will fail compilation, because x might be undefined.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>During the build 2016 conference co-designer of TypeScript Anders Hejlsberg gave a detailed explanation and demonstration of this feature: <a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B881\">video</a> (from 44:30 to 56:30).</p>\n\n<h1>Compilation</h1>\n\n<p>To use TypeScript you need a build process to compile to JavaScript code. The build process generally takes only a couple of seconds depending of course on the size of your project. The TypeScript compiler supports incremental compilation (<code>--watch</code> compiler flag), so that all subsequent changes can be compiled at greater speed. </p>\n\n<p>The TypeScript compiler can inline source map information in the generated .js files or create separate .map files. Source map information can be used by debugging utilities like the Chrome DevTools or some IDE to relate the lines in the JavaScript to the ones that generated them in the TypeScript. This makes it possible for you to set breakpoints and inspect variables during runtime. Source map information works pretty good, it was around long before TypeScript, but debugging TypeScript is generally not as great as when using JavaScript directly. Take the  <code>this</code> keyword for example. Due to the changed semantics of the <code>this</code> keyword around closures since ES2015, <code>this</code> may actually exists during runtime as a variable called <code>_this</code> (see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30056593/visual-studio-shows-wrong-value-for-this-in-typescript/30070859#30070859\">this answer</a>). This may confuse you during debugging, but generally is not a problem if you know about it or inspect the JavaScript code. It should be noted that Babel suffers the exact same kind of issue.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few other tricks the TypeScript compiler can do, like generating intercepting code based on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/29775830/1860591\">decorators</a>, generating module loading code for different module systems and parsing <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/JSX\">JSX</a>. However, you will likely require a build tool besides the Typescript compiler. For example if you want to compress your code you will have to add other tools to your build process to do so.</p>\n\n<p>There are TypeScript compilation plugins available for <a href=\"https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader\">Webpack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-typescript\">Gulp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-typescript\">Grunt</a> and pretty much any other JavaScript build tool out there. The TypeScript documentation has a section on <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/integrating-with-build-tools.html\">integrating with build tools</a> covering them all. A <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint\">linter</a> is also available in case you would like even more build time checking. There are also a great number of seed projects out there that will get you started with TypeScript in combination with a bunch of other technologies like Angular 2, React, Ember, SystemJs, WebPack, Gulp, etc.</p>\n\n<h1>JavaScript interoperability</h1>\n\n<p>Since TypeScript is so closely related to JavaScript it has great interoperability capabilities, but some extra work is required to work with JavaScript libraries in TypeScript. <a href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/Handbook#modules-working-with-other-javascript-libraries\">TypeScript definitions</a> are needed so that the TypeScript compiler understands that function calls like <code>_.groupBy</code> or <code>angular.copy</code> or <code>$.fadeOut</code> are not in fact illegal statements. The definitions for these functions are placed in <code>.d.ts</code> files. </p>\n\n<p>The simplest form a definition can take is to allow an identifier to be used in anyway. For example, when using <a href=\"https://lodash.com/\">Lodash</a>, a single line definition file <code>declare var _ : any</code> will allow you to call any function you want on <code>_</code>, but then of course you are also still able to make mistakes: <code>_.foobar()</code> would be a legal TypeScript call, but is of course an illegal call at run-time. If you want proper type support and code completion your definition file needs to to be more exact (see <a href=\"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/lodash/lodash.d.ts\">lodash.d.ts</a> for an example). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">Npm modules</a> that come pre-packaged with their own type definitions are automatically understood by the TypeScript compiler (see <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typings-for-npm-packages.html\">documentation</a>). For pretty much any other semi-popular JavaScript library that does not include its own definitions (most projects at this point) somebody out there has already made a <code>.d.ts</code> file. These can be downloaded and managed with a command line tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/typings/typings\">Typings</a>. Typings gets most of its type definitions from a Github repository called <a href=\"https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/\">DefinitelyTyped</a>, but is also able to get them via other source like Github, Npm, Bower, etc. After installing Typings you can run <code>typings install lodash</code> on the command-line in your project directory and you will be ready to start using Lodash. Now your IDE will tell you exactly which Lodash functions are available when you type <code>_.</code> in your editor. </p>\n\n<p>There is one caveat: the TypeScript definitions must match the version of the library you are using at runtime. If they do not, TypeScript might disallow you from calling a function or dereferencing a variable that exist or allow you to call a function or dereference a variable that does not exist. Typings uses a registry to be able to provide different versions of definitions. This is a fairly recent development and to be honest there are not a lot of different versions of libraries available yet, so often times times it is simply the best to use the latest version of a library as definitions tend to be up to date.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, there is a slight hassle to this and it may be one of the reasons you do not choose TypeScript, but instead go for something like Babel that does not suffer from having to get type definitions at all. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can easily overcome any kind of issues caused by incorrect or missing definition files.</p>\n\n<h1>Converting from JavaScript to TypeScript</h1>\n\n<p>Any <code>.js</code> file can be renamed to a <code>.ts</code> and ran through the TypeScript compiler to get syntactically the same JavaScript code as an output (if it was syntactically correct in the first place). Even when the TypeScript compiler gets compilation errors it will still produce a <code>.js</code> file. It can even accept <code>.js</code> files as input with the <code>--allowJs</code> flag. This allows you to start with TypeScript right away. Unfortunately compilation errors are likely to occur in the beginning. One does need to remember that these are not show-stopping errors like you may be used to with other compilers.  </p>\n\n<p>The compilation errors one gets in the beginning when converting a JavaScript project to a TypeScript project are unavoidable by TypeScript's nature. TypeScript checks <em>all</em> code for validity and thus it needs to know about all functions and variables that are used. Thus type definitions need to be in place for all of them otherwise compilation errors are bound to occur. As mentioned in the chapter above, for pretty much any JavaScript framework there are <code>.d.ts</code> files that can easily be acquired with a few <code>typings install</code> commands. It might however be that you've used some obscure library for which no TypeScript definitions are available or that you've polyfilled some JavaScript primitives. In that case you must supply type definitions for these bits in order for the compilation errors to dissapear. Just create a <code>.d.ts</code> file and include it in the tsconfig.json's <code>files</code> array, so that it is always considered by the TypeScript compiler. In it declare those bits that TypeScript does not know about as type <code>any</code>. Once you've eliminated all errors you can gradually introduce typing to those parts according to your needs.</p>\n\n<p>Some work on (re)configuring your build pipeline will also be needed to get TypeScript into the build pipeline. As mentioned in the chapter on compilation there are plenty of good resources out there and I encourage you to look for seed projects that use the combination of tools you want to be working with. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest hurdle is the learning curve. I encourage you to play around with a small project at first. Look how it works, how it builds, which files it uses, how it is configured, how it functions in your IDE, how it is structured, which tools it uses, etc. Converting a large JavaScript codebase to TypeScript is very doable when you know what you are doing, but it might be frustrating when you don't.</p>\n\n<h1>Adoption</h1>\n\n<p>TypeScript is open source (Apache 2 licensed, see <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript\">github</a>) and backed by Microsoft. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg\">Anders Hejlsberg</a>, the lead architect of C# is spearheading the project. It's a very active project; the TypeScript team has been releasing a lot of new features in the last few years and a lot of great ones are still planned to come (see the <a href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap\">roadmap</a>). It also is currently trending (see <a href=\"https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=typescript\">google trends</a>). Npm downloads have increased 20 fold since last year. In February 2016 TypeScript had over a million downloads per month (<a href=\"https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/209-jsj-typescript-with-anders-hejlsberg\">source</a>). Many great projects are coded nowadays using TypeScript, most notably Angular 2 and RxJs. </p>\n", "title": "What is TypeScript and why would I use it in place of JavaScript?", "tags": ["javascript", "typescript"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12694530/what-is-typescript-and-why-would-i-use-it-in-place-of-javascript/35048303#35048303", "question_id": 12694530, "answer_id": 35048303}, {"body": "<p>Typescript does something similar to what less or sass does for CSS.

Just make sure they match because Windows 8.1 will give you 32-bit by default.</p>\n", "title": "Can&#39;t start Eclipse - Java was started but returned exit code=13", "tags": ["java", "android", "eclipse", "windows"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11461607/cant-start-eclipse-java-was-started-but-returned-exit-code-13/26784435#26784435", "question_id": 11461607, "answer_id": 26784435}, {"body": "<p>I was facing same Issue.

The way sparse unique indexes are implemented in Mongo is that objects where that field is missing are not in the index at all - they cannot be retrieved by a query on that field - <code>{$exists: false}</code> just does not work. </p>\n\n<p>The only workaround I have come up with is having a special null family of values, where an empty value is translated to a special prefix (like <strong>null:</strong>) concatenated to a uuid. This is a real headache, because one has to take care of transforming to/from the empty values when writing/quering/reading. A major nuisance.</p>\n\n<p>I have never used server side javascript execution in MongoDB (it is not advised anyway) and their map/reduce has awful performance when there is just one Mongo node.

Most people use CouchDb in a classical 3-tiers web architecture. </p>\n\n<p>In practice the deciding factor for most people will be the fact that MongoDb allows ad-hoc querying with a SQL like syntax while CouchDb doesn't (you've got to create map/reduce views which turns some people off even though creating these views is Rapid Application Development friendly - they have nothing to do with stored procedures).</p>\n\n<p>To address points raised in the accepted answer : CouchDb has a great versionning system, but it doesn't mean that it is only suited (or more suited) for places where versionning is important. Also, couchdb is heavy-write friendly thanks to its append-only nature (writes operations return in no time while guaranteeing that no data will ever be lost).</p>\n\n<p>One very important thing that is not mentioned by anyone is the fact that CouchDb relies on b-tree indexes. This means that whether you have 1 \"row\" or 20 billions, the querying time will always remain below 10ms. This is a game changer which makes CouchDb a low-latency and read-friendly database, and this really shouldn't be overlooked.</p>\n\n<p>To be fair and exhaustive the advantage MongoDb has over CouchDb is tooling and marketing. They have first-class citizen tools for all major languages and platforms making the on-boarding easy and this added to their adhoc querying makes the transition from SQL even easier.</p>\n\n<p>CouchDb doesn't have this level of tooling - even though there are many libraries available today - but CouchDb is exposed as an HTTP API and it is therefore quite easy to create a wrapper in your favorite language to talk with it. I personally like this approach as it avoids bloat and allows you to only take what you want (interface segregation principle).</p>\n\n<p>So I'd say using one or the other is largely a matter of comfort and preference with their paradigms. CouchDb approach \"just fits\", for certain people, but if after learning about the database features (in the exhaustive <a href=\"http://guide.couchdb.org/\">official guide</a>) you don't have your \"hell yeah\" moment, you should probably move on. </p>\n\n<p>I'd discourage using CouchDb if you just want to use \"the right tool for the right job\". because you'll find out that you can't just use it that way and you'll end up being pissed and writing blog posts such as \"Where are joins in CouchDb ?\" and \"Where is transaction management ?\". Indeed  Couchdb is - paradoxically - very transparent but at the same time requires a paradigm shift and a change in the way you approach problems to really shine (and really work). </p>\n\n<p>But once you've done that it really pays off. I'd personally need very strong reasons or a major deal breaker on a project to choose another database, but so far I haven't met any.</p>\n", "title": "When to use CouchDB over MongoDB and vice versa", "tags": ["mongodb", "performance", "nosql", "comparison", "couchdb"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12437790/when-to-use-couchdb-over-mongodb-and-vice-versa/37632625#37632625", "question_id": 12437790, "answer_id": 37632625}, {"body": "<p>Ask this questions yourself?

But the place to start for Android, that Google has built in, is ProGuard. If you have the option of including <strong>shared libraries</strong>, you can include the needed code in C++ to verify file sizes, integration,\netc. If you need to add an external native library to your APK's library folder on every build,\nthen you can use it by the below suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>Put the library in the native library path which defaults to \"libs\" in\nyour project folder.

These will obfuscate your code, and make it harder to read when decompiled, if not impossible.</li>\n<li>Move the most critical parts of the service out of the app, and into a webservice, hidden behind a server side language like PHP. For example, if you have an algorithm that's taken you a million dollars to write. You obviously don't want people stealing it out of your app. Move the algorithm and have it process the data on a remote server, and use the app to simply provide it with the data. Or use the NDK to write them natively into .so files, which are much less likely to be decompiled than apks. I don't think a decompiler for .so files even exists as of now (and even if it did, it wouldn't be as good as the Java decompilers). Additionally, as @nikolay mentioned in the comments, you should use SSL when interacting between the server and device.</li>\n<li>When storing values on the device, don't store them in a raw format. For example, if you have a game, and you're storing the amount of in game currency the user has in SharedPreferences. Let's assume it's <code>10000</code> coins. Instead of saving <code>10000</code> directly, save it using an algorithm like <code>((currency*2)+1)/13</code>. So instead of <code>10000</code>, you save <code>1538.53846154</code> into the SharedPreferences. However, the above example isn't perfect, and you'll have to work to come up with an equation that won't lose currency to rounding errors etc.</li>\n<li>You can do a similar thing for server side tasks. Now for an example, let's actually take your payment processing app. Let's say the user has to make a payment of <code>$200</code>. Instead of sending a raw <code>$200</code> value to the server, send a series of smaller, predefined, values that add up to <code>$200</code>. For example, have a file or table on your server that equates words with values. So let's say that <code>Charlie</code> corresponds to <code>$47</code>, and <code>John</code> to <code>$3</code>. So instead of sending <code>$200</code>, you can send <code>Charlie</code> four times and <code>John</code> four times. On the server, interpret what they mean and add it up. This prevents a hacker from sending arbitrary values to your server, as they do not know what word corresponds to what value. As an added measure of security, you could have an equation similar to point 3 for this as well, and change the keywords every <code>n</code> number of days.</li>\n<li>Finally, you can insert random useless source code into your app, so that the hacker is looking for a needle in a haystack. Insert random classes containing snippets from the internet, or just functions for calculating random things like the Fibonacci sequence. Make sure these classes compile, but aren't used by the actual functionality of the app. Add enough of these false classes, and the hacker would have a tough time finding your real code.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All in all, there's no way to protect your app 100%. You can make it harder, but not impossible. Your web server could be compromised, the hacker could figure out your keywords by monitoring multiple transaction amounts and the keywords you send for it, the hacker could painstakingly go through the source and figure out which code is a dummy.</p>\n\n<p>You can only fight back, but never win.</p>\n", "title": "How to avoid reverse engineering of an APK file?", "tags": ["android", "security", "proguard", "reverse-engineering"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13854425/how-to-avoid-reverse-engineering-of-an-apk-file/13854751#13854751", "question_id": 13854425, "answer_id": 13854751}, {"body": "<p>The main question here is that can the dex files be decompiled and the answer is they can be \"sort of\".

This has its own share of problems, because it means users must be connected to the Internet to use your app.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it's not just Android that has this problem. It's a problem on every app store. It's just a matter of how difficult it is to get to the package file (for example, I don't believe it's very easy on iPhones, but it's still possible).</p>\n", "title": "How to avoid reverse engineering of an APK file?", "tags": ["android", "security", "proguard", "reverse-engineering"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13854425/how-to-avoid-reverse-engineering-of-an-apk-file/13863133#13863133", "question_id": 13854425, "answer_id": 13863133}, {"body": "<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>First rule of app security:</strong> Any machine to which an attacker gains unrestricted physical or electronic access now belongs to your attacker, regardless of where it actually is or what you paid for it.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Second rule of app security:</strong> Any software that leaves the physical boundaries inside which an attacker cannot penetrate now belongs to your attacker, regardless of how much time you spent coding it.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Third rule:</strong> Any information that leaves those same physical boundaries that an attacker cannot penetrate now belongs to your attacker, no matter how valuable it is to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The foundations of information technology security are based on these three fundamental principles; the only truly secure computer is the one locked in a safe, inside a Farraday cage, inside a steel cage. There are computers that spend most of their service lives in just this state; once a year (or less), they generate the private keys for trusted root certification authorities (in front of a host of witnesses with cameras recording every inch of the room in which they are located).</p>\n\n<p>Now, most computers are not used under these types of environments; they're physically out in the open, connected to the Internet over a wireless radio channel. In short, they're vulnerable, as is their software. They are therefore not to be trusted. There are certain things that computers and their software must know or do in order to be useful, but care must be taken to ensure that they can never know or do enough to cause damage (at least not permanent damage outside the bounds of that single machine).</p>\n\n<p>You already knew all this; that's why you're trying to protect the code of your application. But, therein lies the first problem; obfuscation tools can make the code a mess for a human to try to dig through, but the program still has to run; that means the actual logic flow of the app and the data it uses are unaffected by obfuscation. Given a little tenacity, an attacker can simply un-obfuscate the code, and that's not even necessary in certain cases where what he's looking at can't be anything else but what he's looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, you should be trying to ensure that an attacker cannot do anything with your code, no matter how easy it is for him to obtain a clear copy of it. That means, no hard-coded secrets, because those secrets aren't secret as soon as the code leaves the building in which you developed it.</p>\n\n<p>These key-values you have hard-coded should be removed from the application's source code entirely. Instead, they should be in one of three places; volatile memory on the device, which is harder (but still not impossible) for an attacker to obtain an offline copy of; permanently on the server cluster, to which you control access with an iron fist; or in a second data store unrelated to your device or servers, such as a physical card or in your user's memories (meaning it will eventually be in volatile memory, but it doesn't have to be for long).</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following scheme. The user enters their credentials for the app from memory into the device. You must, unfortunately, trust that the user's device is not already compromised by a keylogger or Trojan; the best you can do in this regard is to implement multi-factor security, by remembering hard-to-fake identifying information about the devices the user has used (MAC/IP, IMEI, etc), and providing at least one additional channel by which a login attempt on an unfamiliar device can be verified.</p>\n\n<p>The credentials, once entered, are obfuscated by the client software (using a secure hash), and the plain-text credentials discarded; they have served their purpose. The obfuscated credentials are sent over a secure channel to the certificate-authenticated server, which hashes them <em>again</em> to produce the data used to verify the validity of the login. This way, the client never knows what is actually compared to the database value, the app server never knows the plaintext credentials behind what it receives for validation, the data server never knows how the data it stores for validation is produced, and a man in the middle sees only gibberish even if the secure channel were compromised.</p>\n\n<p>Once verified, the server transmits back a token over the channel. The token is only useful within the secure session, is composed of either random noise or an encrypted (and thus verifiable) copy of the session identifiers, and the client application must send this token on the same channel to the server as part of any request to do something. The client application will do this many times, because it can't do anything involving money, sensitive data, or anything else that could be damaging by itself; it must instead ask the server to do this task. The client application will never write any sensitive information to persistent memory on the device itself, at least not in plain text; the client can ask the server over the secure channel for a symmetric key to encrypt any local data, which the server will remember; in a later session the client can ask the server for the same key to decrypt the data for use in volatile memory. That data won't be the only copy, either; anything the client stores should also be transmitted in some form to the server.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this makes your application heavily dependent on Internet access; the client device cannot perform any of its basic functions without proper connection to and authentication by the server. No different than Facebook, really.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the computer that the attacker wants is your server, because it and not the client app/device is the thing that can make him money or cause other people pain for his enjoyment. That's OK; you get much more bang for your buck spending money and effort to secure the server than in trying to secure all the clients. The server can be behind all kinds of firewalls and other electronic security, and additionally can be physically secured behind steel, concrete, keycard/pin access, and 24-hour video surveillance. Your attacker would need to be very sophisticated indeed to gain any kind of access to the server directly, and you would (should) know about it immediately. </p>\n\n<p>The best an attacker can do is steal a user's phone and credentials and log in to the server with the limited rights of the client. Should this happen, just like losing a credit card, the legitimate user should be instructed to call an 800 number (preferably easy to remember, and not on the back of a card they'd carry in their purse, wallet or briefcase which could be stolen alongside the mobile device) from any phone they can access that connects them directly to your customer service. They state their phone was stolen, provide some basic unique identifier, and the account is locked, any transactions the attacker may have been able to process are rolled back, and the attacker is back to square one.</p>\n", "title": "How to avoid reverse engineering of an APK file?", "tags": ["android", "security", "proguard", "reverse-engineering"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13854425/how-to-avoid-reverse-engineering-of-an-apk-file/13867141#13867141", "question_id": 13854425, "answer_id": 13867141}, {"body": "<p>The other upvoted answers here are correct.

Payment applications should not contain any embedded certificates.

GUI, logic, whatever. A clone program will not have exactly the same internal state. Sure, it is a state machine which has similar externally visible state transitions (as can be observed by inputs and outputs), but hardly the same internal state. A server application can interrogate the program: what is your detailed state? (i.e. give me a checksum over all of your internal state variables).  This can be compared against dummy client code which executes on the server in parallel, going through the genuine state transitions. A third party clone will have to replicate all of the relevant state changes of the genuine program in order to give the correct responses, which will hamper its development.</p>\n", "title": "How to avoid reverse engineering of an APK file?", "tags": ["android", "security", "proguard", "reverse-engineering"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13854425/how-to-avoid-reverse-engineering-of-an-apk-file/13870938#13870938", "question_id": 13854425, "answer_id": 13870938}, {"body": "<blockquote>\n  <p>&nbsp;1.

You can inject and use that particular service in other components, like controllers, directives and filters.  A factory is a method on a module and it also takes a name and a function, that defines the factory. We can also inject and use the it same way we did with the service.</p>\n\n<p>Objects created with new use the value of the prototype property of their constructor function as their prototype, so I found the Angular code that calls Object.create(), that I believe is the service constructor function when it gets instantiated. However, a factory function is really just a function that gets called, which is why we have to return an object literal for the factory.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the angular 1.5 code I found for factory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var needsRecurse = false;\n    var destination = copyType(source);\n\n    if (destination === undefined) {\n      destination = isArray(source) ? [] : Object.create(getPrototypeOf(source));\n      needsRecurse = true;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Angular source code snippet for the factory() function:</p>\n\n<pre><code> function factory(name, factoryFn, enforce) {\n    return provider(name, {\n      $get: enforce !== false ? enforceReturnValue(name, factoryFn) : factoryFn\n    });\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It takes the name and the factory function that is passed and returns a provider with the same name, that has a $get method which is our factory function. Whenever you ask the injector for a specific dependency, it basically asks the corresponding provider for an instance of that service, by calling the $get() method. That\u2019s why $get() is required, when creating providers.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the angular 1.5 code for service.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function service(name, constructor) {\n    return factory(name, ['$injector', function($injector) {\n      return $injector.instantiate(constructor);\n    }]);\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It turns out that when we call service(), it actually calls factory()! However, it doesn\u2019t just pass our service constructor function to the factory as is. It also passes a function that asks the injector to instantiate an object by the given constructor. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, if we inject MyService somewhere, what happens in the code is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>MyServiceProvider.$get(); // return the instance of the service\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To restate it again, a service calls a factory, which is a $get() method on the corresponding provider. Moreover, $injector.instantiate() is the method that ultimately calls Object.create() with the constructor function. That\u2019s why we use \"this\" in services.</p>\n\n<p>For ES5 it doesn't matter which we use: service() or factory(), it\u2019s always a factory that is called which creates a provider for our service. </p>\n\n<p>You can do the exact same thing with services as well though.  A service is a constructor function, however, that doesn\u2019t prevent us from returning object literals. So we can take our service code and write it in a way that it basically does the exact same thing as our factory or in other words, you can write a service as a factory to return an object. </p>\n\n<p>Why do most people recommend to use factories over services?  This is the best answer I've seen which comes from Pawel Kozlowski's book: Mastering Web Application Development with AngularJS.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The factory method is the most common way of getting objects into\n  AngularJS dependency injection system. It is very flexible and can\n  contain sophisticated creation logic. Since factories are regular\n  functions, we can also take advantage of a new lexical scope to\n  simulate \"private\" variables. This is very useful as we can hide\n  implementation details of a given service.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "Confused about Service vs Factory", "tags": ["angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13762228/confused-about-service-vs-factory/38151469#38151469", "question_id": 13762228, "answer_id": 38151469}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13762228/confused-about-service-vs-factory", "question_id": 13762228}, {"body": "<p>In my office, the mere mention of the word Xerces is enough to incite murderous rage from developers. A cursory glance at the other Xerces questions on SO seem to indicate that almost all Maven users are \"touched\" by this problem at some point.  Unfortunately, understanding the problem requires a bit of knowledge about the history of Xerces...</p>\n\n<h1>History</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Xerces is the most widely used XML parser in the Java ecosystem.  Almost every library or framework written in Java uses Xerces in some capacity (transitively, if not directly).</p></li>\n<li><p>The Xerces jars included in the <a href=\"http://xerces.apache.org/mirrors.cgi#binary\">official binaries</a> are, to this day, not versioned.  For example, the Xerces 2.11.0 implementation jar is named <code>xercesImpl.jar</code> and not <code>xercesImpl-2.11.0.jar</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Xerces team <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454?focusedCommentId=12881865&amp;page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3acomment-tabpanel#comment-12881865\">does not use Maven</a>, which means they do not\nupload an official release to <a href=\"http://search.maven.org/\">Maven Central</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Xerces used to be <a href=\"http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-general.html#faq-3\">released as a single jar</a> (<code>xerces.jar</code>), but was split into two jars, one containing the API (<code>xml-apis.jar</code>) and one containing the implementations of those APIs (<code>xercesImpl.jar</code>).  Many older Maven POMs still declare a dependency on <code>xerces.jar</code>.  At some point in the past, Xerces was also released as <code>xmlParserAPIs.jar</code>, which some older POMs also depend on.</p></li>\n<li><p>The versions assigned to the xml-apis and xercesImpl jars by those who deploy their jars to Maven repositories are often different.  For example, xml-apis might be given version 1.3.03 and xercesImpl might be given version 2.8.0, even though both are from Xerces 2.8.0.  This is because people often tag the xml-apis jar with the version of the specifications that it implements.  There is a very nice, but incomplete breakdown of this <a href=\"http://swordsystems.com/2011/06/29/xerces-and-xml-api-dependency-hell/\">here</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>To complicate matters, Xerces is the XML parser used in the reference implementation of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), included in the JRE. The implementation classes are repackaged under the <code>com.sun.*</code> namespace, which makes it dangerous to access them directly, as they may not be available in some JREs.  However, not all of the Xerces functionality is exposed via the <code>java.*</code> and <code>javax.*</code> APIs; for example, there is no API that exposes Xerces serialization. </p></li>\n<li><p>Adding to the confusing mess, almost all servlet containers (JBoss, Jetty, Glassfish, Tomcat, etc.), ship with Xerces in one or more of their <code>/lib</code> folders.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Problems</h1>\n\n<h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>\n\n<p>For some -- or perhaps all -- of the reasons above, many\norganizations publish and consume custom builds of Xerces in their\nPOMs.  This is not really a problem if you have a small application and are only using Maven Central, but it quickly becomes an issue for enterprise software where Artifactory or Nexus is proxying multiple repositories (JBoss, Hibernate, etc.):\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Fe9Xa.png\" alt=\"xml-apis proxied by Artifactory\"> </p>\n\n<p>For example, organization A might publish xml-apis as:  </p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.xerces&lt;/groupId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;version&gt;2.9.1&lt;/version&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, organization B might publish the same jar as:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;groupId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/groupId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;artifactId&gt;xml-apis&lt;/artifactId&gt;</code><br/>\n<code>&lt;version&gt;1.3.04&lt;/version&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Although B's jar is a lower version than A's jar, Maven does not know\nthat they are the same artifact because they have different\n<code>groupId</code>s.  Thus, it cannot perform conflict resolution and both\njars will be included as resolved dependencies:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/4X1ts.png\" alt=\"resolved dependencies with multiple xml-apis\"></p>\n\n<h3>Classloader Hell</h3>\n\n<p>As mentioned above, the JRE ships with Xerces in the JAXP RI.  While it would be nice to mark all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>s or as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code>, the third-party code you depend on may or may not work with the version provided in JAXP of the JDK you're using.  In addition, you have the Xerces jars shipped in your servlet container to contend with. This leaves you with a number of choices: Do you delete the servlet version and hope that your container runs on the JAXP version? Is it better to leave the servlet version, and hope that your application frameworks run on the servlet version? If one or two of the unresolved conflicts outlined above manage to slip into your product (easy to happen in a large organization), you quickly find yourself in classloader hell, wondering which version of Xerces the classloader is picking at runtime and whether or not it will pick the same jar in Windows and Linux (probably not).</p>\n\n<h1>Solutions?</h1>\n\n<p>We've tried marking all Xerces Maven dependencies as <code>&lt;provided&gt;</code> or as an <code>&lt;exclusion&gt;</code>, but this is difficult to enforce (especially with a large team) given that the artifacts have so many aliases (xml-apis, xerces, xercesImpl, xmlParserAPIs, etc.).  Additionally, our third party libs/frameworks may not run on the JAXP version or the version provided by a servlet container.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How can we best address this problem with Maven?  Do we have to exercise such fine-grained control over our dependencies, and then rely on tiered classloading?  Is there some way to globally exclude all Xerces dependencies, and force all of our frameworks/libs to use the JAXP version?</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Joshua Spiewak has uploaded a patched version of the Xerces build scripts to <a href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1454\">XERCESJ-1454</a> that allows for upload to Maven Central.

For this I use the % value of the patent view, example , if I want the width to be half of parent view take 50 % of parent and same applies for height and center. </p>\n\n<p>With this I don't even need the xibs.</p>\n", "title": "How to develop or migrate apps for iPhone 5 screen resolution?", "tags": ["ios", "iphone", "screen", "iphone-5"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12395200/how-to-develop-or-migrate-apps-for-iphone-5-screen-resolution/13590651#13590651", "question_id": 12395200, "answer_id": 13590651}, {"body": "<p>It's easy for migrating iPhone5 and iPhone4 through XIBs.........</p>\n\n<pre><code>UIViewController *viewController3;\nif ([[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds].size.height == 568)\n{\n    UIViewController *viewController3 = [[[mainscreenview alloc] initWithNibName:@\"iphone5screen\" bundle:nil] autorelease];

I'm doing this by passing <code>$routeParams</code> to the main app module.  Here is an example of what's in my app:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('myApp', []).\n    config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {\n        $routeProvider.                     \n            when(\"/job/:jobId/zones/:zoneId\", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/zone_edit.html' }).\n            when(\"/job/:jobId/initial_inspection\", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/initial_inspection.html' }).\n            when(\"/job/:jobId/zones/:zoneId/rooms/:roomId\", { controller: JobDetailController, templateUrl: 'assets/job_list_app/templates/room_edit.html' })       \n\n    }]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>In circle 2</strong>, the template that is loaded into the <code>ng-view</code> has an additional <strong>sub-navigation</strong>.  This sub-nav then needs to load templates into the area below it - but since ng-view is already being used, I'm not sure how to go about doing this.</p>\n\n<p>I know that I can include additional templates within the 1st template, but these templates are all going to be pretty complex.  I would like to keep all the templates separate in order to make the application easier to update and not have a dependency on the parent template having to be loaded in order to access its children.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In circle 3</strong>, you can see things get even more complex.  There is the potential that the sub-navigation templates will have a <strong>2nd sub-navigation</strong> that will need to load its own templates as well into the area in <strong>circle 4</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>How does one go about structuring an AngularJS app to deal with such complex nesting of templates while keeping them all separate from one another?</strong></p>\n", "title": "Complex nesting of partials and templates", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>Well, since you can currently only have one ngView directive... I use nested directive controls. This allows you to set up templating and inherit (or isolate) scopes among them.

This syntax is kind of an extended version of Python's list comprehensions and knowing that helps me to remember the syntax very easily. It's something like this:</p>\n\n<p>Python code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>my_list = [x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]\n&gt; [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n# let people to be a list of person instances\nmy_list2 = [person.name for person in people]\n&gt; my_list2 = ['Alice', 'Bob']\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is actually the same syntax as the first one listed above. However, in <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> we usually need to differentiate between the actual value in code and the text shown (the label) in a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element. Like, we need <code>person.id</code> in the code but we don't want to show the <code>id</code> to the user, we want to show its name. Likewise, we're not interested in the <code>person.name</code> in the code. There comes <code>as</code> keyword to label stuff. So it becomes like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>person.id as person.name for person in people\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or, instead of <code>person.id</code> we could need the <code>person</code> instance/reference itself. See below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>person as person.name for person in people\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For JS objects, the same method applies as well, just remember that the items in the object is deconstructed with <code>(key, value)</code> pairs.</p>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/12140310#12140310", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 12140310}, {"body": "<p>How the value attributes gets its value:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>when using array as datasource, it will be the index of array element in each iteration;</li>\n<li>when using object as datasource, it will be the property name in each iteration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So in your case it should be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>obj = { '1': '1st', '2': '2nd' };\n\n&lt;select ng-options=\"k as v for (k,v) in obj\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/12384319#12384319", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 12384319}, {"body": "<p>You can do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\"model\"&gt;\n    &lt;option value=\"\"&gt;Select&lt;/option&gt;\n    &lt;option ng-repeat=\"obj in array\" value=\"{{obj.id}}\"&gt;{{obj.name}}&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>-- UPDATE</p>\n\n<p>After some updates, the solution of frm.adiputra is much better: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/12384319#12384319\">How to set value property in angularjs ng-options?</a>\nCode: </p>\n\n<pre><code>obj = { '1': '1st', '2': '2nd' };\n&lt;select ng-options=\"k as v for (k,v) in obj\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/13183751#13183751", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 13183751}, {"body": "<p>If you want to change the value of your <code>option</code> elements because the form will eventually be submitted to the server, instead of doing this :</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select name=\"text\" ng-model=\"text\" ng-options=\"select p.text for p in resultOptions\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can do this :</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\"text\" ng-options=\"select p.text for p in resultOptions\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"text\" value=\"{{ text }}\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The expected value will then be sent through the form under the correct name.</p>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/17070766#17070766", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 17070766}, {"body": "<p>The <code>ng-options</code> directive does not set the value attribute on the <code>&lt;options&gt;</code> elements for arrays:</p>\n\n<p>Using <code>limit.value as limit.text for limit in limits</code> means:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>set the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>'s label as <code>limit.text</code><br>\n  save the <code>limit.value</code> value into the select's <code>ng-model</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14425686/angularjs-ng-options-not-rendering-values\">AngularJS ng-options not rendering values</a></p>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/17399552#17399552", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 17399552}, {"body": "<p>For an object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\"mySelect\" ng-options=\"key as value for (key, value) in object\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/19701879#19701879", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 19701879}, {"body": "<p>The correct answer to this question has been provided by frm.adiputra, as currently this seems to be the only way to explicitly control the value attribute of the option elements.</p>\n\n<p>However, I just wanted to emphasize that \"select\" is not a keyword in this context, but it is just a placeholder for an expression.

In this case, follow the same pattern that is used for generating elements such as <code>&lt;li /&gt;</code>'s under <code>&lt;ul /&gt;</code>'s  and place a ng-repeat on an option element:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select name=\u201cvalue\u201d&gt;\n    &lt;option ng-repeat=\u201cvalue in Model.Values\u201d value=\u201c{{value.value}}\u201d&gt;\n        {{value.text}}\n    &lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge\">kludge</a>, one can always move the name attribute of the select element to a hidden input element:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\u201cselectedValue\u201d ng-options=\u201cvalue.text for value in Model.Values\u201d&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n&lt;input type=\u201chidden\u201d name=\u201cvalue\u201d value=\u201c{{selectedValue}}\u201d /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/20025059#20025059", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 20025059}, {"body": "<p>To send a custom value called <code>my_hero</code> to the server using a normal form submit:</p>\n\n<p>JSON:</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"heroes\": [\n  {\"id\":\"iron\", \"label\":\"Iron Man Rocks!\"},\n  {\"id\":\"super\", \"label\":\"Superman Rocks!\"}\n]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\"hero\" ng-options=\"obj.id as obj.label for obj in heroes\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"my_hero\" value=\"{{hero}}\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The server will receive either <code>iron</code> or <code>super</code> as the value of <code>my_hero</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to the answer by @neemzy, but specifying separate data for the <code>value</code> attribute.</p>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/20273185#20273185", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 20273185}, {"body": "<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\"color\" ng-options=\"(c.name+' '+c.shade) for c in colors\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to set the value property in AngularJS&#39; ng-options?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12139152/how-to-set-the-value-property-in-angularjs-ng-options/20355819#20355819", "question_id": 12139152, "answer_id": 20355819}, {"body": "<p>Selecting an item in ng-options can be a bit tricky depending on how you set the data source. </p>\n\n<p>After struggling with them for a while I end up making a sample with most common data sources I use, you can find it here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://plnkr.co/edit/fGq2PM?p=preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://plnkr.co/edit/fGq2PM?p=preview</a></p>\n\n<p>Now to make ng-options work here are some things to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Normally you get the options from 1 source and the selected value from other.e.g.\n<ul>\n<li>states :: data for ng-options</li>\n<li>user.state :: Option to set as selected</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Based on 1, the easiest/logical thing to do is to fill the select with one source and then set the selected value trough code.

Therefore we use <code>setTimeout</code> and <strong>closures</strong> to capture the value of the counter variable to make sure that it will not print N times the value N.</p>\n\n<p>The wrong solution without <strong>closures</strong> or anything near to <strong>closures</strong> would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        console.log(i);\n    }, 1000);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which will of course print 10 times the value of <code>i</code> after the loop, namely 10.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So his attempt was:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\n    (function(){\n        var i2 = i;\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            console.log(i2);\n        }, 1000)\n    })();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>printing 0 to 9 as expected.</p>\n\n<p>I told him that he isn't using a <strong>closure</strong> to capture <code>i</code>, but he insists that he is. I proved that he doesn't use <strong>closures</strong> by putting the for loop body within another <code>setTimeout</code> (passing his anonymous function to <code>setTimeout</code>), printing 10 times 10 again. The same applies if I store his function in a <code>var</code> and execute it <em>after</em> the loop, also printing 10 times 10.

What happens with the variables declared in the scope of the parent function; will I be able to access them from the scope of the child function?\nThat's exactly where closures step in.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Closures</strong></p>\n\n<p>In JavaScript the function <code>g</code> can not only access any variables declared in scope <code>g</code> but also access any variables declared in the scope of the parent function <code>f</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Consider following;</p>\n\n<pre><code>function f()//lexical parent function\n{//begin of scope f\n  var foo='hello'; //foo declared in scope f\n  function g()\n  {//being of scope g\n    var bar='bla'; //bar declared in scope g\n    console.log(foo);\n  }//end of scope g\n  g();\n  console.log(bar);\n}//end of scope f\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>calling f prints</p>\n\n<pre><code>hello\nundefined\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's look at the line <code>console.log(foo);</code>. At this point we are in scope <code>g</code> and we try to access the variable <code>foo</code> that is declared in scope <code>f</code>. But as stated before we can access any variable declared in a lexical parent function which is the case here; <code>g</code> is the lexical parent of <code>f</code>. Therefore <code>hello</code> is printed.<br>\nLet's now look at the line <code>console.log(bar);</code>. At this point we are in scope <code>f</code> and we try to access the variable <code>bar</code> that is declared in scope <code>g</code>. <code>bar</code> is not declared in the current scope and the function <code>g</code> is not the parent of <code>f</code>, therefore <code>bar</code> is undefined<br></p>\n\n<p>Actually we can also access the variables declared in the scope of a lexical \"grand parent\" function.

This is done with <strong>closures</strong>. In JavaScript <strong>closures</strong> allows us to access any variable declared in the lexical parent function, in the lexical grand parent function, in the lexical grand-grand parent function, etc. \nThis can be seen as a <strong>scope chain</strong>; <code> scope of current function -> scope of lexical parent function -> scope of lexical grand parent function -> ... </code> until the last parent function that has no lexical parent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The window object</strong></p>\n\n<p>Actually the chain doesn't stop at the last parent function.

Mapping it into a path variable like this is a terrible design:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://www.someexample.com/xsrf/{xsrfKey}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because by nature you would want to pass xsrf key to other path too, <code>/login</code>, <code>/book-appointment</code> etc. and you don't want to mess your pretty URL</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly adding it as an object field isn't appropriate either, because now on each of json object you pass to server you have to add the field</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  appointmentId : 23,\n  name : 'Joe Citizen',\n  xsrf : '...'\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You certainly don't want to add another field on your server-side class which does not have a direct semantic association with the domain object.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion the best way to pass your xsrf key is via a HTTP header. Many xsrf protection server-side web framework library support this. <a href=\"http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.5.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#csrf-include-csrf-token\" rel=\"nofollow\">For example in Java Spring, you can pass it using <code>X-CSRF-TOKEN</code> header</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Angular's excellent capability of binding JS object to UI object means we can get rid of the practice of posting form all together, and post JSON instead.

Suppose you put those classes in two different files:</p>\n\n<p><strong>My.java:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>abstract class My {\n    public void myMethod() {\n        System.out.print(\"Abstract\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Poly.java:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>class Poly extends My {\n    public static void main(String a[]) {\n        My m = new My() {};\n        m.myMethod();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, compile both your source files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>javac My.java Poly.java\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now in the directory where you compiled the source code, you will see the following class files:</p>\n\n<pre><code>My.class\nPoly$1.class  // Class file corresponding to anonymous subclass\nPoly.class\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See that class - <code>Poly$1.class</code>. It's the class file created by the compiler corresponding to the anonymous subclass you instantiated using the below code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>new My() {};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, it's clear that there is a different class being instantiated.

On top of that you can actually unwind through not only one but a series of push/modal/popover segues, e.g. \"go back\" multiple steps in your navigation hierarchy with a single unwind action.</p>\n\n<p>When you perform an unwind segue, you need to specify an action, which is an action method of the view controller you want to unwind to.</p>\n\n<p><em>Objective-C:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>- (IBAction)unwindToThisViewController:(UIStoryboardSegue *)unwindSegue\n{\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Swift:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>@IBAction func unwindToThisViewController(segue: UIStoryboardSegue) {\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The name of this action method is used when you create the unwind segue in the storyboard. Furthermore, this method is called just before the unwind segue is performed. You can get the source view controller from the passed <code>UIStoryboardSegue</code> parameter to interact with the view controller that initiated the segue (e.g. to get the property values of a modal view controller). In this respect, the method has a similar function as the <code>prepareForSegue:</code> method of <code>UIViewController</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>iOS 8 update:</strong> Unwind segues also work with iOS 8's adaptive segues, such as <em>Show</em> and <em>Show Detail</em>.</p>\n\n<h1>An Example</h1>\n\n<p>Let us have a storyboard with a navigation controller and three child view controllers:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/gyLe3.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>From Green View Controller you can unwind (navigate back) to Red View Controller. From Blue you can unwind to Green or to Red via Green. To enable unwinding you must add the special action methods to Red and Green, e.g. here is the action method in Red:</p>\n\n<p><em>Objective-C:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>@implementation RedViewController\n\n- (IBAction)unwindToRed:(UIStoryboardSegue *)unwindSegue\n{\n}\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Swift:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>@IBAction func unwindToRed(segue: UIStoryboardSegue) {\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the action method has been added, you can define the unwind segue in the storyboard by control-dragging to the Exit icon. Here we want to unwind to Red from Green when the button is pressed:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/rOlfW.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>You must select the action which is defined in the view controller you want to unwind to:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/H03n7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>You can also unwind to Red from Blue (which is \"two steps away\" in the navigation stack).

In the example I defined an unwind segue to Red from both Green and Blue. We can access the source of the unwind in the action method via the UIStoryboardSegue parameter:</p>\n\n<p><em>Objective-C:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>- (IBAction)unwindToRed:(UIStoryboardSegue *)unwindSegue\n{\n    UIViewController* sourceViewController = unwindSegue.sourceViewController;\n\n    if ([sourceViewController isKindOfClass:[BlueViewController class]])\n    {\n        NSLog(@\"Coming from BLUE!\");\n    }\n    else if ([sourceViewController isKindOfClass:[GreenViewController class]])\n    {\n        NSLog(@\"Coming from GREEN!\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><em>Swift:</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>@IBAction func unwindToRed(unwindSegue: UIStoryboardSegue) {\n    if let blueViewController = unwindSegue.sourceViewController as? BlueViewController {\n        println(\"Coming from BLUE\")\n    }\n    else if let redViewController = unwindSegue.sourceViewController as? RedViewController {\n        println(\"Coming from RED\")\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Unwinding also works through a combination of push/modal segues. E.g. if I added another Yellow view controller with a modal segue, we could unwind from Yellow all the way back to Red in a single step:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oWb8u.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<h1>Unwinding from Code</h1>\n\n<p>When you define an unwind segue by control-dragging something to the Exit symbol of a view controller, a new segue appears in the Document Outline:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7Wx7u.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Selecting the segue and going to the Attributes Inspector reveals the \"Identifier\" property.

If you use semantic classes you might be able to get away with refactoring only the css.

Importantly, it was the first time many people encountered the concept of modularization and of getting things out of global scope. So, if you're going to build a Javascript application that needs to scale, then Require and the AMD pattern are not bad tools for doing that.</p>\n\n<p>But, <strong>is there anything particular about Angular that makes Require/AMD a particularly good fit?</strong> No. In fact, Angular provides you with its own modularization and encapsulation pattern, which in many ways renders redundant the basic modularization features of AMD. And, integrating Angular modules into the AMD pattern is not impossible, but it's a bit... finicky. You'll definitely be spending time getting the two patterns to integrate nicely.</p>\n\n<p>For some perspective from the Angular team itself, there's <a href=\"http://briantford.com/blog/huuuuuge-angular-apps.html\">this</a>, from Brian Ford, author of the Angular Batarang and now a member of the Angular core team:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I don't recommend using RequireJS with AngularJS. Although it's certainly possible, I haven't seen any instance where RequireJS was beneficial in practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, on the very specific question of AngularJS: Angular and Require/AMD are orthogonal, and in places overlapping. You <em>can</em> use them together, but there's no reason specifically related to the nature/patterns of Angular itself. </p>\n\n<h3>But what about basic management of internal and external dependencies for scalable Javascript applications? Doesn't Require do something really critical for me there?</h3>\n\n<p>I recommend checking out Bower and NPM, and particularly NPM. I'm not trying to start a holy war about the comparative benefits of these tools. I merely want to say: there are other ways to skin that cat, and those ways <em>may</em> be even better than AMD/Require. (They certainly have much more popular momentum in late-2015, particularly NPM, combined with ES6 or CommonJS modules. See <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18641899/what-is-the-difference-between-bower-and-npm/31633281#31633281\">related SO question</a>.)</p>\n\n<h3>What about lazy-loading?</h3>\n\n<p>Note that lazy-loading and lazy-downloading are different. Angular's lazy-loading doesn't mean you're pulling them direct from the server. In a Yeoman-style application with javascript automation, you're concatenating and minifying the whole shebang together into a single file. They're present, but not executed/instantiated until needed. The speed and bandwidth improvements you get from doing this vastly, vastly outweigh any alleged improvements from lazy-downloading a particular 20-line controller. In fact, the wasted network latency and transmission overhead for that controller is going to be an order of magnitude greater than the size of the controller itself.</p>\n\n<p>But let's say you really do need lazy-downloading, perhaps for infrequently-used pieces of your application, such as an admin interface. That's a very legitimate case. Require can indeed do that for you. But there are <a href=\"https://oclazyload.readme.io/\">also</a> <a href=\"http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload\">many</a> <a href=\"https://chris.lu/article/read/506de698268c420f0d000004\">other</a>, <a href=\"http://w3bits.com/async-javascript/\">potentially</a> <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com/js/lazy-loading-asyncronous-javascript/\">more</a> <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20578731/how-to-lazy-load-non-angular-javascript-files-using-angularjs\">flexible</a> <a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/02/redefining-lazy-loading-with-lazy-load-xt/\">options</a> that accomplish the same thing. And Angular 2.0 will apparently take care of this for us, built-in to the <a href=\"https://github.com/angular/router\">router</a>. (<a href=\"http://www.syntaxsuccess.com/viewarticle/lazy-loading-in-angular-2.0\">Details</a>.)</p>\n\n<h3>But what about during development on my local dev boxen?</h3>\n\n<p>How can I get all my dozens/hundreds of script files loaded without needing to attach them all to index.html manually?</p>\n\n<p>Have a look at the sub-generators in Yeoman's generator-angular, or at the automation patterns embodied in <a href=\"https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular\">generator-gulp-angular</a>, or at the standard Webpack automation for React. These provide you a clean, scalable way to either: automatically attach the files at the time that components are scaffolded, or to simply grab them all automatically if they are present in certain folders/match certain glob-patterns. You never again need to think about your own script-loading once you've got the latter options. </p>\n\n<h3>Bottom-line?</h3>\n\n<p>Require is a great tool, for certain things. But go with the grain whenever possible, and separate your concerns whenever possible. Let Angular worry about Angular's own modularization pattern, and consider using ES6 modules or CommonJS as a general modularization pattern. Let modern automation tools worry about script-loading and dependency-management. And take care of async lazy-loading in a granular way, rather than by tangling it up with the other two concerns. </p>\n\n<p>That said, if you're developing Angular apps but can't install Node on your machine to use Javascript automation tools for some reason, then Require may be a good alternate solution. And I've seen really elaborate setups where people want to dynamically load Angular components that each declare their own dependencies or something. And while I'd probably try to solve that problem another way, I can see the merits of the idea, for that very particular situation. </p>\n\n<p>But otherwise... when starting from scratch with a new Angular application and flexibility to create a modern automation environment... you've got a lot of other, more flexible, more modern options.</p>\n\n<p><em>(Updated repeatedly to keep up with the evolving JS scene.)</em></p>\n", "title": "Does it make sense to use Require.js with Angular.js?", "tags": ["javascript", "requirejs", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12529083/does-it-make-sense-to-use-require-js-with-angular-js/18615865#18615865", "question_id": 12529083, "answer_id": 18615865}, {"body": "<p>I think that it depends on your project complexity since angular is pretty much modularized. \nYour controllers can be mapped and you can just import those JavaScript classes in your index.html page. </p>\n\n<p>But in case your project get bigger.

Let's say you created a \"first\" module that implements an AngularJS filter \"greet\":</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>angular\n  .module('first', [])\n  .filter('greet', function() {\n    return function(name) {\n      return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';\n    }\n  });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now let's say you want to use the \"greet\" filter in another module called \"second\" that implements a \"goodbye\" filter. You may do that injecting the \"first\" module to the \"second\" module:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>angular\n  .module('second', ['first'])\n  .filter('goodbye', function() {\n    return function(name) {\n      return 'Good bye, ' + name + '!';\n    }\n  });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The thing is that in order to make this work correctly without RequireJS, you have to make sure that the \"first\" AngularJS module is loaded on the page before you create the \"second\" AngularJS module. Quoting documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Depending on a module implies that required module needs to be loaded\n  before the requiring module is loaded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that sense, here is where RequireJS can help you as RequireJS provides a clean way to inject scripts to the page helping you organize script dependencies between each other.</p>\n\n<p>Going back to the \"first\" and \"second\" AngularJS modules, here is how you can do it using RequireJS separating the modules on different files to leverage script dependencies loading:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>// firstModule.js file\ndefine(['angular'], function(angular) {\n  angular\n    .module('first', [])\n    .filter('greet', function() {\n      return function(name) {\n        return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';\n      }\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>// secondModule.js file\ndefine(['angular', 'firstModule'], function(angular) {\n  angular\n    .module('second', ['first'])\n    .filter('goodbye', function() {\n      return function(name) {\n        return 'Good bye, ' + name + '!';\n      }\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can see that we are depending on \"firstModule\" file to be injected before the content of the RequireJS callback can be executed which needs \"first\" AngularJS module to be loaded to create \"second\" AngularJS module.</p>\n\n<p>Side note: Injecting \"angular\" on the \"firstModule\" and \"secondModule\" files as dependency is required in order to use AngularJS inside the RequireJS callback function and it have to be configured on RequireJS config to map \"angular\" to the library code. You may have AngularJS loaded to the page in a traditional manner too (script tag) although defeats RequireJS benefits. </p>\n\n<p>More details on having RequireJS support from AngularJS core from 2.0 version on my blog post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Based on my blog post <em>\"Making sense of RequireJS with AngularJS\"</em>, here is the <a href=\"http://leog.me/log/making-sense-of-requirejs-with-angularjs/\">link</a>.</strong></p>\n", "title": "Does it make sense to use Require.js with Angular.js?", "tags": ["javascript", "requirejs", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12529083/does-it-make-sense-to-use-require-js-with-angular-js/20954143#20954143", "question_id": 12529083, "answer_id": 20954143}, {"body": "<p>Short answer is, it make sense.

Here's some additional information....</p>\n\n<h1>Filters &amp; Formatters</h1>\n\n<p><code>ng-bind</code> and <code>ng-model</code> both have the concept of transforming data before outputting it for the user. To that end, <code>ng-bind</code> uses <em>filters</em>, while <code>ng-model</code> uses <em>formatters</em>.</p>\n\n<h2>filter (ng-bind)</h2>\n\n<p>With <code>ng-bind</code>, you can use a <em>filter</em> to transform your data. For example,</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;div ng-bind=\"mystring | uppercase\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, </p>\n\n<p>or more simply: </p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;div&gt;{{mystring | uppercase}}&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Note that <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter/uppercase\"><code>uppercase</code> is a built-in angular filter</a>, although you can also <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_09\">build your own filter</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>formatter (ng-model)</h2>\n\n<p>To create an ng-model formatter, you create a directive that does <code>require: 'ngModel'</code>, which allows that directive to gain access to ngModel's <code>controller</code>. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.directive('myModelFormatter', function() {\n  return {\n    require: 'ngModel',\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs, controller) {\n     controller.$formatters.push(function(value) {\n        return value.toUpperCase();\n      });\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then in your partial:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input ngModel=\"mystring\" my-model-formatter /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is essentially the <code>ng-model</code> equivalent of what the <code>uppercase</code> <em>filter</em> is doing in the <code>ng-bind</code> example above. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Parsers</h1>\n\n<p>Now, what if you plan to allow the user to change the value of <code>mystring</code>? <code>ng-bind</code> only has one way binding, from <strong>model</strong>--><strong>view</strong>. However, <code>ng-model</code> can bind from <strong>view</strong>--><strong>model</strong> which means that you may allow the user to change the model's data, and using a <em>parser</em> you can format the user's data in a streamlined manner. Here's what that looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.directive('myModelFormatter', function() {\n  return {\n    require: 'ngModel',\n    link: function(scope, element, attrs, controller) {\n     controller.$parsers.push(function(value) {\n        return value.toLowerCase();\n      });\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://plnkr.co/edit/QFrHJMm9p14EgGpTDr13?p=preview\"><strong>Play with a live plunker of the <code>ng-model</code> formatter/parser examples</strong></a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>What Else?</h1>\n\n<p><code>ng-model</code> also has built-in validation.

Depending on your system, they may do different things. For instance, on systems that don't use X11 like OSX or Windows, the <code>\"*</code> register is used to read and write to the system clipboard. On X11 systems both registers can be used. See <code>:help x11-selection</code> for more details, but basically the <code>\"*</code> is analogous to X11's <em>PRIMARY</em> selection (which usually copies things you select with the mouse and pastes with the middle mouse button) and <code>\"+</code> is analogous to X11's <em>CLIPBOARD</em> selection (which is the clipboard proper).</p>\n\n<p>If all that went over your head, try using <code>\"*yy</code> or <code>\"+yy</code> to copy a line to your system's clipboard. One or the other should work. You might like to remap this to something more convenient for you. For example, you could put <code>vnoremap &lt;C-c&gt; \"*y</code> in your ~/.vimrc so that you can visually select and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to yank to your system's clipboard.</p>\n\n<p>Be aware that copying/pasting from the system clipboard <strong>will not work</strong> if <code>:echo has('clipboard')</code> returns 0. In this case, vim is not compiled with the <code>+clipboard</code> feature and you'll have to install a different version or recompile it. Some linux distros supply a minimal vim installation by default, but generally if you install the vim-gtk package you can get the extra features.</p>\n\n<p>You also may want to have a look at the <code>'clipboard'</code> option described at <code>:help cb</code>. In this case you can <code>:set clipboard=unnamed</code> or <code>:set clipboard=unnamedplus</code> to make all yanking/deleting operations automatically copy to the system clipboard. This could be an inconvenience in some cases where you are storing something else in the clipboard as it will override it.</p>\n\n<p>To paste you can use <code>\"+p</code> or <code>\"*p</code> (again, depending on your system and/or desired selection) or you can map these to something else.

If you're in insert mode you can still paste them with proper indentation by using <code>&lt;C-r&gt;&lt;C-p&gt;*</code> or <code>&lt;C-r&gt;&lt;C-p&gt;+</code>. See <code>:help i_CTRL-R_CTRL-P</code>.</p>\n\n<p>It's also worth mentioning vim's <code>paste</code> option (<code>:help paste</code>). This puts vim into a special \"paste mode\" that disables several other options, allowing you to easily paste into vim using your terminal emulator or multiplexer's familiar paste shortcut. Simply type <code>:set paste</code> to enable it, paste your content and then type <code>:set nopaste</code> to disable it. Alternatively, you can use the <code>pastetoggle</code> option to set a keycode that toggles the mode (<code>:help pastetoggle</code>). I recommend using registers instead of these options, but if they are still too scary this can be a convenient workaround while you're perfecting your vim chops.</p>\n\n<p>See <code>:help clipboard</code> for more detailed information.</p>\n", "title": "How to make vim paste from (and copy to) system&#39;s clipboard?", "tags": ["vim", "editor", "clipboard"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11489428/how-to-make-vim-paste-from-and-copy-to-systems-clipboard/11489440#11489440", "question_id": 11489428, "answer_id": 11489440}, {"body": "<h3>Linux</h3>\n\n<p>On my Linux system, the <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> registers map to an X11 selection, which can be pasted with the middle mouse button.

Keys in an array must be numeric, whereas any string can be used as key in objects. The key-value pairs are also called the <strong>\"properties\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Properties can be accessed either using <strong>dot notation</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>const value = obj.someProperty;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or <strong>bracket notation</strong>, if the property name would not be a valid JavaScript <a href=\"http://es5.github.com/#x7.6\">identifier name <em><sup>[spec]</sup></em></a>, or the name is the value of a variable:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// the space is not a valid character in identifier names\nconst value = obj[\"some Property\"];\n\n// property name as variable\nconst name = \"some Property\";\nconst value = obj[name];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For that reason, array elements can only be accessed using bracket notation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>const value = arr[5]; // arr.5 would be a syntax error\n\n// property name / index as variable\nconst x = 5;\nconst value = arr[x];\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Wait... what about JSON?</h3>\n\n<p>JSON is a textual representation of data, just like XML, YAML, CSV, and others. To work with such data, it first has to be converted to JavaScript data types, i.e. arrays and objects (and how to work with those was just explained). How to parse JSON is explained in the question <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4935632/how-to-parse-json-in-javascript\">Parse JSON in JavaScript?</a> .</p>\n\n<h3>Further reading material</h3>\n\n<p>How to access arrays and objects is fundamental JavaScript knowledge and therefore it is advisable to read the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide\">MDN JavaScript Guide</a>, especially the sections</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects\">Working with Objects</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Predefined_Core_Objects#Array_Object\">Arrays</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html\">Eloquent JavaScript - Data Structures</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Accessing nested data structures</h2>\n\n<p>A nested data structure is an array or object which refers to other arrays or objects, i.e. its values are arrays or objects. Such structures can be accessed by consecutively applying dot or bracket notation. </p>\n\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>const data = {\n    code: 42,\n    items: [{\n        id: 1,\n        name: 'foo'\n    }, {\n        id: 2,\n        name: 'bar'\n    }]\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Let's assume we want to access the <code>name</code> of the second item. </p>\n\n<p>Here is how we can do it step-by-step:</p>\n\n<p>As we can see <code>data</code> is an object, hence we can access its properties using dot notation. The <code>items</code> property is accessed as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data.items\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The value is an array, to access its second element, we have to use bracket notation:</p>\n\n<pre><code>data.items[1]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This value is an object and we use dot notation again to access the <code>name</code> property.

It would make sense to make the action bar static in this regard, since it would allow the user to <em>always</em> have the option to search for new videos.</p></li>\n<li><p>The G+ app uses a <code>ViewPager</code> to display its content, so making the pull out menu specific to the layout content (i.e. everything under the action bar) wouldn't make much sense. Swiping is supposed to provide a means of navigating between pages, not a means of global navigation. This might be why they decided to do it differently in the G+ app than they did in the YouTube app. </p>\n\n<p>On another note, check out the Google Play app for another version of the \"pull out menu\" (when you are at the left most page, swipe left and a pull out, \"half-page\" menu will appear).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You're right in that this isn't very consistent behavior, but it doesn't seem like there is a 100% consensus within the Android team on how this behavior should be implemented yet. I wouldn't be surprised if in the future the apps are updated so that the navigation in both apps are identical (they seemed very keen on making navigation consistent across all Google-made apps in the talk).</p>\n", "title": "Navigation Drawer (Google+ vs. YouTube)", "tags": ["java", "android", "android-layout", "android-actionbar", "navigation-drawer"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11377472/navigation-drawer-google-vs-youtube/11379852#11379852", "question_id": 11377472, "answer_id": 11379852}, {"body": "<p>Just recently I forked a current Github project called \"RibbonMenu\" and edited it to fit my needs:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jaredsburrows/RibbonMenu\">https://github.com/jaredsburrows/RibbonMenu</a></p>\n\n<h3>What's the Purpose</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ease of Access: Allow easy access to a menu that slides in and out</li>\n<li>Ease of Implementation: Update the same screen using minimal amount of code</li>\n<li>Independency: Does not require support libraries such as ActionBarSherlock</li>\n<li>Customization: Easy to change colors and menus</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>What's New</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the sliding animation to match Facebook and Google+ apps</li>\n<li>Added standard ActionBar (you can chose to use ActionBarSherlock)</li>\n<li>Used menuitem to open the Menu</li>\n<li>Added ability to update ListView on main Activity</li>\n<li>Added 2 ListViews to the Menu, similiar to Facebook and Google+ apps</li>\n<li>Added a AutoCompleteTextView and a Button as well to show examples of implemenation</li>\n<li>Added method to allow users to hit the 'back button' to hide the menu when it is open</li>\n<li>Allows users to interact with background(main ListView) and the menu at the same time unlike the Facebook and Google+ apps!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>ActionBar with Menu out</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/63ckm.png\" alt=\"ActionBar with Menu out\"></p>\n\n<p>ActionBar with Menu out and search selected</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0gEZF.png\" alt=\"ActionBar with Menu out and search selected\"></p>\n", "title": "Navigation Drawer (Google+ vs. YouTube)", "tags": ["java", "android", "android-layout", "android-actionbar", "navigation-drawer"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11377472/navigation-drawer-google-vs-youtube/13947171#13947171", "question_id": 11377472, "answer_id": 13947171}, {"body": "<p>Personally I like the navigation drawer in Google Drive official app. It just works and works great.

Behaviour is kept out of the view, but at a glance you can see what is happening.  </p>\n\n<p>Bootstrap example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-lg btn-danger\" data-toggle=\"popover\" title=\"Popover title\" data-content=\"And here's some amazing content.

This can be circumvented by either using the third alternative above, or frameworks like Angular and their ng-click attributes with automatically scope. </p>\n", "title": "jQuery.click() vs onClick", "tags": ["javascript", "html", "javascript-events", "jquery"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12627443/jquery-click-vs-onclick/26439633#26439633", "question_id": 12627443, "answer_id": 26439633}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12627443/jquery-click-vs-onclick", "question_id": 12627443}, {"body": "<p>Just started using Xcode 4.5 and I got this error in the console:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Warning: Attempt to present &lt; finishViewController: 0x1e56e0a0 > on &lt; ViewController: 0x1ec3e000> whose view is not in the window hierarchy!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The view is still being presented and everything in the app is working fine.

I would like to comment on people voting against detecting iPad mini versus 2 as Apple has uhm, one guideline to rule them all. Okay, here's my reasoning why I feel it really makes all sense in the world to know if a person is using an iPad mini or a 2. And do with my reasoning what you like.</p>\n\n<p>The iPad mini is not only a much smaller device (9.7 inch versus 7.9 inch), but its form factor allows for a different usage. The iPad 2 is usually held with two hands when gaming unless you're <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_facts\">Chuck Norris</a>. The mini is smaller, but it is also much lighter and allows for gameplay where you hold it in one hand and use another to swipe or tap or whatnot. As a game designer and developer myself, I'd just like to <strong>know</strong> if it's a mini so I can choose to provide the player with a different controlscheme if I want (for instance after A/B testing with a group of players). </p>\n\n<p>Why? Well, it's a proven fact that the majority of users tend to go with the default settings, so leaving out a virtual thumbstick and putting some other tap-based control on the screen (just giving an arbitrary example here) when the player loads up the game for the first time is what I, and probably other game designers, would love to <strong>be able to</strong> do.</p>\n\n<p>So IMHO this goes beyond the thick fingers / guidelines discussions and is just something Apple and all other vendors ought to do: allow us to uniquely identify your device and <strong>think different</strong> instead of <strong>following</strong> guidelines.</p>\n", "title": "Detect iPad Mini in HTML5", "tags": ["javascript", "html5", "ipad", "svg"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>Unfortunately, at the moment it seems like this isn't possible:\n<a href=\"http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/ipad-mini-detection-for-html5-user-agent\">http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/ipad-mini-detection-for-html5-user-agent</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two days ago, I\u2019ve tweeted about the first detected problem: \u201c<strong>It is\n  confirmed that the iPad Mini User Agent is the same as the iPad 2</strong>\u201c.\n  I\u2019ve received literally hundreds of answers saying that user agent\n  sniffing is a bad practice, that we should detect features not\n  devices, etc, etc.</p>\n  \n  <p>Well yes guys, you are right, but it has no direct relationship with\n  the problem.

Apple appears not to want us to write different code for the different size versions of iPads. Not being part of Apple myself, I don't know this for sure, I'm just saying that this is what it appears like. Maybe, if the developer community comes up with a fancy detector for iPad minis, Apple may deliberately break that detector in future versions of iOS. Apple wants you to set your minimum target size to 44 iOS points, and iOS will display that in two sizes, the larger iPad size and the smaller iPhone/iPad mini size. 44 points is plenty generous, and your users will certainly know if they are on the smaller iPad, so can compensate on their own.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest stepping back to your stated reason for asking for the detector: adjusting target size for end user comfort. By deciding to design for one size on the large iPad and another size on the small iPad you are deciding that all people have the same size fingers. If your design is tight enough that the difference in size from an iPad 2 and an iPad mini makes a difference, than the size of fingers between me and my wife will make a bigger difference. So compensate for user finger size, not iPad model. </p>\n\n<p>I have a suggestion on how to measure finger size. I'm a native iOS developer, so I don't know if this can be accomplished in HTML5, but here's how I would measure finger size in a native app. I'd have the user pinch two objects together, then measure how close they get together. Smaller fingers will get the objects closer together, and you can use this measurement to derive a scaling factor. This automatically adjusts for iPad size. The same person will have a larger measurement of on screen points on an iPad mini than on an iPad 2. For a game you can call this a calibration step, or not even call it out. Have it as a starting step. For example in a shooting game have the player put the ammo in the gun with a pinching motion.</p>\n", "title": "Detect iPad Mini in HTML5", "tags": ["javascript", "html5", "ipad", "svg"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13248493/detect-ipad-mini-in-html5/13380502#13380502", "question_id": 13248493, "answer_id": 13380502}, {"body": "<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong>  My original answer, below, was \"don't do it\".  In the interest of being positive:</p>\n\n<p>The real question, I think, has nothing to do with the iPad X vs. iPad mini.  I think it is about optimizing UI element dimensions and placement to the user's ergonomics. You need to determine the size of the user's finger/s in order to drive your UI element sizing and, perhaps, positioning.  This, again, is and should probably be arrived at without needing to actually know what device you are running on.  Let's exaggerate: Your app is running on a 40 inch diagonal screen.  Don't know the make and model or the DPI.  How do you size the controls?</p>\n\n<p>You need to display a button that is the gating element into the site/game.  I'll leave it up to you to decide where or how it makes sense to do this.</p>\n\n<p>While the user will see this as a single button, in reality it will be composed of a matrix of small tightly packed buttons that is visually covered to appear as a single button image.  Imagine a 100 x 100 pixel button made up of 400 buttons, each 5 x 5 pixels.  You need to experiment to see what makes sense here and how small your sampling needs to be.</p>\n\n<p>Possible CSS for button array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.sense_row {\n  width:100px;\n  height:5px;\n  margin:0;\n  padding:0;\n}\n\n.sense_button {\n  float:left;\n  width:3px;\n  height:3px;\n  padding:0px;\n  margin:0px;\n  background-color:#FF0;\n  border:1px solid #000;\n} \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And the resulting array:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/azVsS.png\" alt=\"button array\"></p>\n\n<p>When the user touches the button array you will, effectively, get an image of the user's finger's contact area.  You can then use whatever criteria you want (probably empirically derived) in order to arrive at a set of numbers that you can use to scale and position the various UI elements per your requirements.  </p>\n\n<p>The beauty of this approach is that you no-longer care about what device name or model you might be dealing with.  All you care about is the size of the user's finger in relation to the device.</p>\n\n<p>I would imagine that this sense_array button could be hidden as part of the entry process into the application.  For example, if it is a game, maybe there's a \"Play\" button or various buttons with the user's names or a means to select what level they'll play, etc.  You get the idea.  The sense_array button could live anywhere the user has to touch in order to get into the game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>  Just noting that you probably don't need that many sense buttons.  A set of concentric circles or buttons arranged like a huge asterisk <code>*</code> might do just fine.  You have to experiment.</p>\n\n<p>With my old answer, below, I am giving you both sides of the coin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OLD ANSWER:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The right answer is:  Don't do this.  It's a bad idea.</p>\n\n<p>If your buttons are so small that they become unusable on a mini you need to make your buttons larger.  </p>\n\n<p>If I have learned anything at all in doing native iOS apps it's that trying to outsmart Apple is a formula for undue pain and aggravation.  If they chose to not allow you to identify the device it's because, well, in their sandbox, you shouldn't.</p>\n\n<p>I wonder, are you adjusting the size/location in portrait vs. landscape?</p>\n", "title": "Detect iPad Mini in HTML5", "tags": ["javascript", "html5", "ipad", "svg"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13248493/detect-ipad-mini-in-html5/13381781#13381781", "question_id": 13248493, "answer_id": 13381781}, {"body": "<p>Not tested, but instead of playing an audio file and check the balance, it could work to listen to the microphone, extract the background noise, and compute its \"color\" (frequency graph).

This is because Angular actually allows you to select entire objects with select controls, and not just primitive types. For example:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>app.controller('MainCtrl', function($scope) {\n   $scope.items = [\n     { id: 1, name: 'foo' },\n     { id: 2, name: 'bar' },\n     { id: 3, name: 'blah' }\n   ];\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;div ng-controller=\"MainCtrl\"&gt;\n   &lt;select ng-model=\"selectedItem\" ng-options=\"item as item.name for item in items\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n   &lt;pre&gt;{{selectedItem | json}}&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above will allow you to select an entire object into <code>$scope.selectedItem</code> directly. <strong>The point is, with Angular, you don't need to worry about what's in your option tag. Let Angular handle that, you should only care about what's in your model in your scope.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://plnkr.co/edit/SxIvt4KThWLtWvh3PnOh?p=preview\">Here is a plunker demonstrating the behavior above, and showing the html written out</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>EDIT 2: Dealing with the default option:</h2>\n\n<p>There are a few things I've failed to mention above relating to the default option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Selecting first option and removing the empty option:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can do this by adding a simple <code>ng-init</code> that sets the model (from <code>ng-model</code>) to the first element in the items your repeating in <code>ng-options</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-init=\"foo = foo || items[0]\" ng-model=\"foo\" ng-options=\"item as item.name for item in items\"&gt;&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: this could get a little crazy if foo happens to be initialized properly to something \"falsy\". In that case, you'll want to handle the initialization of foo in your controller, most likely.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Customizing the default option:</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is a little different, here all you need to do is add an option tag as a child of your select, with an empty value attribute, then customize it's inner text:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\"foo\" ng-options=\"item as item.name for item in items\"&gt;\n   &lt;option value=\"\"&gt;Nothing selected&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: that in this case the \"empty\" option will stay there even after you select a different option. This isn't the case for the default behavior of selects under Angular.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A customized default option that hides after a selection is made:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you wanted your customized default option to go away after you select a value, you can add an ng-hide attribute to your default option:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;select ng-model=\"foo\" ng-options=\"item as item.name for item in items\"&gt;\n   &lt;option value=\"\" ng-if=\"foo\"&gt;Select something to remove me.&lt;/option&gt;\n&lt;/select&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Working with select using Angular&#39;s ng-options", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "html-select", "ng-options"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13047923/working-with-select-using-angulars-ng-options/13049740#13049740", "question_id": 13047923, "answer_id": 13049740}, {"body": "<p>I'm learning angularjs and was struggling with selection as well.

so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function detectmob() { \n if( navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i)\n || navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i)\n || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i)\n || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i)\n || navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i)\n || navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i)\n || navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)\n ){\n    return true;\n  }\n else {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However since you believe that this method is unreliable, You could assume that any device that had a resolution of 800x600 or less was a mobile device too, narrowing your target even more (although these days many mobile devices have much greater resolutions than this)</p>\n\n<p>i.e </p>\n\n<pre><code>function detectmob() {\n   if(window.innerWidth &lt;= 800 &amp;&amp; window.innerHeight &lt;= 600) {\n     return true;\n   } else {\n     return false;\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Reference:</strong>

It just fires and forgets (so make sure it's a fire-and-forget notification, not something that requires action)</p>\n\n<pre><code>.factory('UserService', [ '$rootScope', function($rootScope) {\n   var service = &lt;whatever you do for the object&gt;\n\n   service.save = function(data) {\n     .. validate data and update model ..\n     // notify listeners and provide the data that changed [optional]\n     $rootScope.$broadcast('user:updated',data);\n   }\n\n   // alternatively, create a callback function and $broadcast from there if making an ajax call\n\n   return service;\n}]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The service above would broadcast a message to every scope when the save() function completed and the data was valid.  Alternatively, if it's a $resource or an ajax submission, move the broadcast call into the callback so it fires when the server has responded.  Broadcasts suit that pattern particularly well because every listener just waits for the event without the need to inspect the scope on every single $digest. The listener would look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>.controller('UserCtrl', [ 'UserService', '$scope', function(UserService, $scope) {\n\n  var user = UserService.getUser();\n\n  // if you don't want to expose the actual object in your scope you could expose just the values, or derive a value for your purposes\n   $scope.name = user.firstname + ' ' +user.lastname;\n\n   $scope.$on('user:updated', function(event,data) {\n     // you could inspect the data to see if what you care about changed, or just update your own scope\n     $scope.name = user.firstname + ' ' + user.lastname;\n   });\n\n   // different event names let you group your code and logic by what happened\n   $scope.$on('user:logout', function(event,data) {\n     .. do something differently entirely ..\n   });\n\n }]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One of the benefits of this is the elimination of multiple watches. If you were combining fields or deriving values like the example above, you'd have to watch both the firstname and lastname properties. Watching the getUser() function would only work if the user object was replaced on updates, it would not fire if the user object merely had its properties updated.  In which case you'd have to do a deep watch and that is more intensive.  </p>\n\n<p>$broadcast sends the message from the scope it's called on down into any child scopes.  So calling it from $rootScope will fire on every scope.  If you were to $broadcast from your controller's scope, for example, it would fire only in the scopes that inherit from your controller scope.  $emit goes the opposite direction and behaves similarly to a DOM event in that it bubbles up the scope chain.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that there are scenarios where $broadcast makes a lot of sense, and there are scenarios where $watch is a better option - especially if in an isolate scope with a very specific watch expression.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS : How to watch service variables?", "tags": ["angularjs", "watch", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12576798/angularjs-how-to-watch-service-variables/20863597#20863597", "question_id": 12576798, "answer_id": 20863597}, {"body": "<p>I'm using similar approach as @dtheodot but using angular promise instead of passing callbacks</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($q) {\n    var self = this,\n        defer = $q.defer();\n\n    this.foo = 0;\n\n    this.observeFoo = function() {\n        return defer.promise;\n    }\n\n    this.setFoo = function(foo) {\n        self.foo = foo;\n        defer.notify(self.foo);\n    }\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then wherever just use <code>myService.setFoo(foo)</code> method to update <code>foo</code> on service.

Very easy and elegant!</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS : How to watch service variables?", "tags": ["angularjs", "watch", "angular-services"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12576798/angularjs-how-to-watch-service-variables/31587739#31587739", "question_id": 12576798, "answer_id": 31587739}, {"body": "<p><strong>==UPDATED==</strong></p>\n\n<p>Very simple now in $watch.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepen.io/hayatbiralem/pen/LpQQrw\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pen here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>HTML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"container\" data-ng-app=\"app\"&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"well\" data-ng-controller=\"FooCtrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FooController&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"col-sm-6\"&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"\" ng-click=\"setItems([ { name: 'I am single item' } ])\"&gt;Send one item&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"\" ng-click=\"setItems([ { name: 'Item 1 of 2' }, { name: 'Item 2 of 2' } ])\"&gt;Send two items&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"\" ng-click=\"setItems([ { name: 'Item 1 of 3' }, { name: 'Item 2 of 3' }, { name: 'Item 3 of 3' } ])\"&gt;Send three items&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"col-sm-6\"&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"\" ng-click=\"setName('Sheldon')\"&gt;Send name: Sheldon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"\" ng-click=\"setName('Leonard')\"&gt;Send name: Leonard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"\" ng-click=\"setName('Penny')\"&gt;Send name: Penny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n  &lt;div class=\"well\" data-ng-controller=\"BarCtrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BarController&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p ng-if=\"name\"&gt;Name is: {{ name }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-repeat=\"item in items\"&gt;{{ item.name }}&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>JavaScript:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var app = angular.module('app', []);\n\napp.factory('PostmanService', function() {\n  var Postman = {};\n  Postman.set = function(key, val) {\n    Postman[key] = val;\n  };\n  Postman.get = function(key) {\n    return Postman[key];\n  };\n  Postman.watch = function($scope, key, onChange) {\n    return $scope.$watch(\n      // This function returns the value being watched.

This is because our reference to <code>aService.foo</code> is outdated, but our reference to <code>aService2.foo</code> is not. We created a reference to the initial array with <code>$scope.foo = aService.foo;</code>, which was then discarded by the service on it's next update, meaning <code>$scope.foo</code> no longer referenced the array we wanted anymore.</p>\n\n<p>However, while there are several ways to make sure the initial reference is kept in tact, sometimes it may be necessary to change the object or array. Or what if the service property references a primitive like a <code>String</code> or <code>Number</code>? In those cases, we cannot simply rely on a reference. So what <em>can</em> we do?</p>\n\n<p>Several of the answers given previously already give some solutions to that problem.

You added an unnecessary <code>$watch</code> in the controller which explicitly puts <code>foo</code> on the <code>$scope</code> whenever it changes. You don't need that extra <code>$watch</code> when you attach <code>aService</code> instead of <code>aService.foo</code> to the <code>$scope</code>, and bind explicitly to <code>aService.foo</code> in the markup.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now that's all well and good assuming a <code>$digest</code> cycle is being applied. In my examples above, I used Angular's <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$interval\"><code>$interval</code></a> service to update the arrays, which automatically kicks off a <code>$digest</code> loop after each update. But what if the service variables (for whatever reason) aren't getting updated inside the \"Angular world\".

(If you also need a link function (or pre and post link functions), and you defined a compile function, the compile function must return the link function(s) because the <code>'link'</code> attribute is ignored if the <code>'compile'</code> attribute is defined.)</p></li>\n<li><p><em>link function</em> - normally use for registering listener callbacks (i.e., <code>$watch</code> expressions on the scope) as well as updating the DOM (i.e., manipulation of iElement = individual instance element). It is executed after the template has been cloned.  E.g., inside an <code>&lt;li ng-repeat...&gt;</code>, the link function is executed after the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> template (tElement) has been cloned (into an iElement) for that particular <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element.  A <code>$watch</code> allows a directive to be notified of scope property changes (a scope is associated with each instance), which allows the directive to render an updated instance value to the DOM.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>controller function</em> - must be used when another directive needs to interact with this directive.  E.g., on the AngularJS home page, the pane directive needs to add itself to the scope maintained by the tabs directive, hence the tabs directive needs to define a controller method (think API) that the pane directive can access/call. <br> <br>For a more in-depth explanation of the tabs and pane directives, and why the tabs directive creates a function on its controller using <code>this</code> (rather than on <code>$scope</code>), please see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11605917/this-vs-scope-in-angularjs-controllers/14168699#14168699\">&#39;this&#39; vs $scope in AngularJS controllers</a>.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In general, you can put methods, <code>$watches</code>, etc. into either the directive's controller or link function.  The controller will run first, which sometimes matters (see this <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/mrajcok/xfh3F/\">fiddle</a> which logs when the ctrl and link functions run with two nested directives).  As Josh mentioned in a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14620521/how-to-write-a-directive-in-angularjs/14621193#comment20441740_14621193\">comment</a>, you may want to put scope-manipulation functions inside a controller just for consistency with the rest of the framework.</p>\n", "title": "Difference between the &#39;controller&#39;, &#39;link&#39; and &#39;compile&#39; functions when defining a directive", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "web-applications", "javascript-framework"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12546945/difference-between-the-controller-link-and-compile-functions-when-definin/12570008#12570008", "question_id": 12546945, "answer_id": 12570008}, {"body": "<p>As complement to Mark's answer, the compile function does not have access to scope, but the link function does.</p>\n\n<p>I really recommend this video; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqmeI5fZcho\">Writing Directives</a> by Misko Hevery (the father of AngularJS), where he describes differences and some techniques.

This gets around the issue of <code>__name__</code> being <code>__main__</code> that was pointed out by @BrenBarn. Next, put an empty <code>__init__.py</code> file into your test directory, this will make the test directory part of your package. Then you will be able to do</p>\n\n<pre><code>from ..components.core import GameLoopEvents\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, if you run your test script as a main program then things will fail once again. So just use the test runner. Maybe this also works with other test runners such as <code>nosetests</code> but i haven't checked it. Hope this helps.  </p>\n", "title": "How to fix &quot;Attempted relative import in non-package&quot; even with __init__.py", "tags": ["python", "python-import"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11536764/how-to-fix-attempted-relative-import-in-non-package-even-with-init-py/33698004#33698004", "question_id": 11536764, "answer_id": 33698004}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11536764/how-to-fix-attempted-relative-import-in-non-package-even-with-init-py", "question_id": 11536764}, {"body": "<p>I created a byte array with two strings.

I put it in a file called \"app.js\":</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function () {\n    'use strict';\n    var app = angular.module(\"app\", [\"ngResource\"]);\n\n    app.config(function ($routeProvider) {\n        // configure routes\n        $routeProvider.when(\"/\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/home.html\",\n            controller:\"MainCtrl\"\n        })\n            .when(\"/home\", {\n            templateUrl: \"partials/home.html\",\n            controller:\"MainCtrl\"\n        })\n            .when(\"/login\", {\n            templateUrl:\"partials/login.html\",\n            controller:\"LoginCtrl\"\n        })\n            .when(\"/admin\", {\n            templateUrl:\"partials/admin.html\",\n            controller:\"AdminCtrl\"\n        })\n            .when(\"/critters\", {\n            templateUrl:\"partials/critters.html\",\n            controller:\"CritterCtrl\"\n        })\n            .when(\"/critters/:id\", {\n            templateUrl:\"partials/critter-detail.html\",\n            controller:\"CritterDetailCtrl\"\n        })\n            .otherwise({redirectTo:\"/home\"});\n    });\n\n}());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you look toward the end of the module, you'll see that I have a critter-detail page based on :id.  It's a partial that is used from the Crispy Critters page.  [Corny, I know - maybe it's a site that celebrates all kinds of chicken nuggets ;)  Anyway, you could update the title when a user clicks on any link, so in my main Crispy Critters page that leads to the critter-detail page, that's where the $root.title update would go, just like you saw in the nav.html above:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a href=\"#/critters/1\" ng-click=\"$root.title = 'Critter 1'\"&gt;Critter 1&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#/critters/2\" ng-click=\"$root.title = 'Critter 2'\"&gt;Critter 2&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"#/critters/3\" ng-click=\"$root.title = 'Critter 3'\"&gt;Critter 3&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Sorry so windy but I prefer a post that gives enough detail to get it up and running.

either be applied to an existing view element whose content is already the view title:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h2 view-title&gt;About This Site&lt;/h2&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...or it can be used as a standalone element, in which case the element will be invisible in the rendered document and will only be used to set the view title:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;view-title&gt;About This Site&lt;/view-title&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The content of this directive is made available in the root scope as <code>viewTitle</code>, so it can be used on the title element just like any other variable:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;title ng-bind-template=\"{{viewTitle}} - My Site\"&gt;My Site&lt;/title&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It can also be used in any other spot that can \"see\" the root scope. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;{{viewTitle}}&lt;/h1&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This solution allows the title to be set via the same mechanism that is used to control the rest of the presentation: AngularJS templates. This avoids the need to clutter controllers with this presentational logic.

It is scarcely following a <strong>linear</strong> fashion to complete a task, but rather, the exchanges between various objects take care of the requests and actions, which, then, is necessary as angular is an <strong>MVC-Based</strong> framework. It also requires an at least general blueprint of the finalized application, since coding depends much on how you want the interactions to be completed.</p>\n\n<p>jQuery is like a <strong>free</strong> poetry, you write lines and keep some relations and momentum appropriate for your task to be accomplished.</p>\n\n<p>Though, in Angular JS, you should follow some rules as well as keeping the momentum and relations proper, maybe it is more like classical Spencerian sonnet (a famous classical poet) whose poem is structural and tied to many rules.</p>\n\n<p>Compared against AngularJS, jQuery is more like a collection of codes and functions (which is, as already mentioned, great for DOM manipulation and fast-effect achievement), while AngularJS is a real framework which gives the developer the ability to build an enterprise web-application with a lot of data-binding and exchange within a superbly organized-routing and management.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, AngularJS has no <strong>dependency on jQuery</strong> to complete its task. It has two very superb features which are not found in jQuery in any sense:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1-</strong> Angular JS teaches you how to CODE and accomplish a goal, not just accomplish a goal by any means. Worth to mention that AngularJS fully utilizes the core and heart of Javascripts and paves the way for you to incorporate in your app, the techniques such as DI (dependency-injection). To work with angularJS you should (or must) learn more elevated techniques of coding with Javascript.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2-</strong> Angular JS is fully independent to handle directives and structure your app; you might then simply claim that jQuery can do the same (independence), but, indeed, AngularJS, as several times mentioned within the above lines, has independence in the most excellent possible structurally MVC-Based way. </p>\n\n<p>A last note is that, there is no war of Names, since it is far disturbing to be biased, or subjective. jQuery's magnitude and greatness has been proved, but their usages and limitations( of any framework or software) are the concerns of the discussion and similar debates around.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using AngularJS is decisive as it is expensive in terms of implementation, but founds a strong base for future expansion, transformation and maintenance of the application. AngularJS is for the New World of Web. It is targeted toward building applications which are characterized by their least resource consumption (loading only necessary resources from the server), fast response time and high degree of maintainability and extendability wrapped around a structured system.</p>\n", "title": "How is AngularJS different from jQuery", "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "angularjs"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13151725/how-is-angularjs-different-from-jquery/24730176#24730176", "question_id": 13151725, "answer_id": 24730176}, {"body": "<p><strong>AngularJS :</strong>\n AngularJS is for developing heavy web applications.

I don't think that there is anything remotely <em>standard</em> in either JSend and especially not with the more verbose among them. XHR will react to HTTP response, if you use jQuery for your AJAX (like most do) you can  use <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> and <code>done()</code>/<code>fail()</code> callbacks to capture errors.

A successful call just has the JSON objects. I don't need a higher level JSON object that contains a success field indicating true and a payload field that has the JSON object. I just return the appropriate JSON object with a 200 or whatever is appropriate in the 200 range for the HTTP status in the header.</p>\n\n<p>However, if there is an error (something in the 400 family) I return a well-formed JSON error object. For example, if the client is POSTing a User with an email address and phone number and one of these is malformed (i.e. I cannot insert it into my underlying database) I will return something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"description\" : \"Validation Failed\"\n  \"errors\" : [ {\n    \"field\" : \"phoneNumber\",\n    \"message\" : \"Invalid phone number.\"\n  } ],\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Important bits here are that the \"field\" property must match the JSON field exactly that could not be validated. This allows clients to know exactly what went wrong with their request. Also, \"message\" is in the locale of the request. If both the \"emailAddress\" and \"phoneNumber\" were invalid then the \"errors\" array would contain entries for both. A 409 (Conflict) JSON response body might look like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"description\" : \"Already Exists\"\n  \"errors\" : [ {\n    \"field\" : \"phoneNumber\",\n    \"message\" : \"Phone number already exists for another user.\"\n  } ],\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the HTTP status code and this JSON the client has all they need to respond to errors in a deterministic way and it does not create a new error standard that tries to complete replace HTTP status codes. Note, these only happen for the range of 400 errors. For anything in the 200 range I can just return whatever is appropriate. For me it is often a HAL-like JSON object but that doesn't really matter here.</p>\n\n<p>The one thing I thought about adding was a numeric error code either in the the \"errors\" array entries or the root of the JSON object itself.

$location.path(path);\n        $rootScope.$digest();\n\n        expect($route.current.templateUrl).toBe(routeData.templateUrl);\n        expect($route.current.controller).toBe(routeData.controller);\n
