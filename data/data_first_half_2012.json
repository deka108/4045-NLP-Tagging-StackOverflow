This type of branch can be easily transformed into a <strong>conditional move</strong> statement, which would be compiled into a conditional move instruction: <code>cmovl</code>, in an <code>x86</code> system. The branch and thus the potential branch prediction penalty is removed.</p>\n\n<p>In <code>C</code>, thus <code>C++</code>, the statment, which would compile directly (without any optimization) into the conditional move instruction in <code>x86</code>, is the ternary operator <code>... ? ... : ...</code>. So we rewrite the above statement into an equivalent one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sum += data[c] &gt;=128 ? data[c] : 0;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>While maintaining readability, we can check the speedup factor.</p>\n\n<p>On an <code>Intel [Core i7][2]-2600K @ 3.4&amp;nbsp;GHz</code> and <code>Visual Studio 2010</code> Release Mode, the benchmark is (format copied from Mysticial):</p>\n\n<p><strong>x86</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>//  Branch - Random\nseconds = 8.885\n\n//  Branch - Sorted\nseconds = 1.528\n\n//  Branchless - Random\nseconds = 3.716\n\n//  Branchless - Sorted\nseconds = 3.71\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>x64</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>//  Branch - Random\nseconds = 11.302\n\n//  Branch - Sorted\n seconds = 1.830\n\n//  Branchless - Random\nseconds = 2.736\n\n//  Branchless - Sorted\nseconds = 2.737\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The result is robust in multiple tests. We get great speedup when the branch result is unpredictable, but we suffer a little bit when it is predictable. In fact, when using a conditional move, the performance is the same regardless of the data pattern.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's look more closely by investigating at the <code>x86</code> assembly they generate. For simplicity, we use two functions <code>max1</code> and <code>max2</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>max1</code> uses the conditional branch <code>if... else ...</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int max1(int a, int b) {\n    if (a &gt; b)\n        return a;\n    else\n        return b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>max2</code> uses the ternary operator <code>... ? ... : ...</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>int max2(int a, int b) {\n    return a &gt; b ? a : b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On a x86-64 machine, <code>GCC -S</code> generates the assembly below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>:max1\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    cmpl    -8(%rbp), %eax\n    jle     .L2\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\n    jmp     .L4\n.L2:\n    movl    -8(%rbp), %eax\n    movl    %eax, -12(%rbp)\n.L4:\n    movl    -12(%rbp), %eax\n    leave\n    ret\n\n:max2\n    movl    %edi, -4(%rbp)\n    movl    %esi, -8(%rbp)\n    movl    -4(%rbp), %eax\n    cmpl    %eax, -8(%rbp)\n    cmovge  -8(%rbp), %eax\n    leave\n    ret\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>max2</code> uses much less code due to the usage of instruction <code>cmovge</code>. But the real gain is that <code>max2</code> does not involve branch jumps, <code>jmp</code>, which would have a significant performance penalty if the predicted result is not right.</p>\n\n<p>So why can a conditional move perform better?</p>\n\n<p>In a typical <code>x86</code> processor, the execution of an instruction is divided to several stages. Roughly, we have different hardware to deal with different stages. So we do not have to wait for one instruction to finish to start a new one. This is called <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28computing%29\">pipelining</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In a branch case, the following instruction is determined by the preceding one, so we can not do pipelining. We have to either wait or predict.</p>\n\n<p>In a conditional move case, the execution conditional move instruction is divided into several stages, but the earlier stages like <code>Fetch</code>, <code>Decode</code>, does not depend on the result of previous instruction, only latter stages need the result. So we wait a fraction of one instruction's execution time. This is why the conditional move version is slower than the branch when prediction is easy.</p>\n\n<p>The book <em><a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0136108040\">Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, second edition</a></em> explains this in detail. You can check Section 3.6.6 for <em>Conditional Move Instructions</em>, entire Chapter 4 for <em>Processor Architecture</em>, and Section 5.11.2 for a special treatment for <em>Branch Prediction and Misprediction Penalties</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, some modern compilers can optimize our code to assembly with better performance, sometimes some compilers can't (the code in question is using Visual Studio's native compiler). Knowing the performance difference between branch and conditional move when unpredictable can help us write code with better performance when the scenario gets so complex that the compiler can not optimize them automatically.</p>\n", "title": "Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?", "tags": ["java", "c++", "performance", "optimization", "branch-prediction"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array/11237235#11237235", "question_id": 11227809, "answer_id": 11237235}, {"body": "<p>If you are curious about even more optimizations that can be done to this code, consider this...

Branch predictors play a critical role in achieving high effective performance!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Lets do some bench marking to understand it better</strong></p>\n\n<p>The performance of an if-statement depends on whether its condition has a predictable pattern.

A common way to eliminate branch prediction that I've found to work particularly good in managed languages is a table lookup instead of using a branch. (although I haven't tested it in this case)</p>\n\n<p>This approach works in general if:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It's a small table and is likely to be cached in the processor</li>\n<li>You are running things in a quite tight loop and/or the processor can pre-load the data</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Background and why</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pfew, so what the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>\n\n<p>From a processor perspective, your memory is slow. To compensate for the difference in speed, they build in a couple of caches in your processor (L1/L2 cache) that compensate for that. So imagine that you're doing your nice calculations and figure out that you need a piece of memory. The processor will get his 'load' operation and loads the piece of memory into cache - and then uses the cache to do the rest of the calculations. Because memory is relatively slow, this 'load' will slow down your program. </p>\n\n<p>Like branch prediction, this was optimized in the Pentium processors: the processor predicts that it needs to load a piece of data and attempts to load that into the cache before the operation actually hits the cache. As we've already seen, branch prediction sometimes goes horribly wrong -- in the worst case scenario you need to go back and actually wait for a memory load, which will take forever (<strong>in other words: failing branch prediction is bad, a memory load after a branch prediction fail is just horrible!</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately for us, if the memory access pattern is predictable, the processor will load it in its fast cache and all is well.</p>\n\n<p>First thing we need to know is what is <em>small</em>? While smaller is generally better, a rule of thumb is to stick to lookup tables that are &lt;=4096 bytes in size. As an upper limit: if your lookup table is larger than 64K it's probably worth reconsidering.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Constructing a table</strong></p>\n\n<p>So we've figured out that we can create a small table. Next thing to do is get a lookup function in place. Lookup functions are usually small functions that use a couple of basic integer operations (and, or, xor, shift, add, remove and perhaps a multiply). What you want is to have your input translated by the lookup function to some kind of 'unique key' in your table, which then simply gives you the answer of all the work you wanted it to do.</p>\n\n<p>In this case: >=128 means we can keep the value, &lt;128 means we get rid of it. The easiest way to do that is by using an 'AND': if we keep it, we AND it with 7FFFFFFF ; if we want to get rid of it, we AND it with 0. Notice also that 128 is a power of 2 -- so we can go ahead and make a table of 32768/128 integers and fill it with one zero and a lot of 7FFFFFFFF's.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Managed languages</strong></p>\n\n<p>You might wonder why this works well in managed languages. After all, managed languages check the boundaries of the arrays with a branch to ensure you don't mess up...</p>\n\n<p>Well, not exactly... :-)</p>\n\n<p>There has been quite some work on eliminating this branch for managed languages. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;array.Length; ++i)\n   // use array[i]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>in this case it's obvious to the compiler that the boundary condition will never hit. At least the Microsoft JIT compiler (but I expect Java does similar things) will notice this and remove the check all together. WOW - that means no branch. Similarly, it will deal with other obvious cases.</p>\n\n<p>If you run into trouble with lookups on managed languages - the key is to add a <code>&amp; 0x[something]FFF</code> to your lookup function to make the boundary check predictable - and watch it going faster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The result for this case</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>// generate data\nint arraySize = 32768;\nint[] data = new int[arraySize];\n\nRandom rnd = new Random(0);\nfor (int c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n    data[c] = rnd.Next(256);\n\n\n// Too keep the spirit of the code in-tact I'll make a separate lookup table\n// (I assume we cannot modify 'data' or the number of loops)\nint[] lookup = new int[256];\n\nfor (int c = 0; c &lt; 256; ++c)\n    lookup[c] = (c &gt;= 128) ? c : 0;\n\n// test\nDateTime startTime = System.DateTime.Now;\nlong sum = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // primary loop\n    for (int j = 0; j &lt; arraySize; ++j)\n    {\n        // here you basically want to use simple operations - so no \n        // random branches, but things like &amp;, |, *, -, +, etc are fine.\n        sum += lookup[data[j]];\n    }\n}\n\nDateTime endTime = System.DateTime.Now;\nConsole.WriteLine(endTime - startTime);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"sum = \" + sum);\n\nConsole.ReadLine();\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?", "tags": ["java", "c++", "performance", "optimization", "branch-prediction"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array/16184827#16184827", "question_id": 11227809, "answer_id": 16184827}, {"body": "<p>One way to avoid branch prediction errors is to build a lookup table, and index it using the data.  Stefan de Bruijn discussed that in his answer.</p>\n\n<p>But in this case, we know values are in the range [0, 255] and we only care about values >= 128.  That means we can easily extract a single bit that will tell us whether we want a value or not: by shifting the data to the right 7 bits, we are left with a 0 bit or a 1 bit, and we only want to add the value when we have a 1 bit.  Let's call this bit the \"decision bit\".</p>\n\n<p>By using the 0/1 value of the decision bit as an index into an array, we can make code that will be equally fast whether the data is sorted or not sorted.  Our code will always add a value, but when the decision bit is 0, we will add the value somewhere we don't care about.  Here's the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Test\nclock_t start = clock();\nlong long a[] = {0, 0};\nlong long sum;\n\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // Primary loop\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n    {\n        int j = (data[c] &gt;&gt; 7);\n        a[j] += data[c];\n    }\n}\n\ndouble elapsedTime = static_cast&lt;double&gt;(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;\nsum = a[1];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code wastes half of the adds, but never has a branch prediction failure.  It's tremendously faster on random data than the version with an actual if statement.</p>\n\n<p>But in my testing, an explicit lookup table was slightly faster than this, probably because indexing into a lookup table was slightly faster than bit shifting.  This shows how my code sets up and uses the lookup table (unimaginatively called <code>lut</code> for \"LookUp Table\" in the code).  Here's the C++ code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// declare and then fill in the lookup table\nint lut[256];\nfor (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; 256; ++c)\n    lut[c] = (c &gt;= 128) ? c : 0;\n\n// use the lookup table after it is built\nfor (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; 100000; ++i)\n{\n    // Primary loop\n    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)\n    {\n        sum += lut[data[c]];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case the lookup table was only 256 bytes, so it fit nicely in cache and all was fast.  This technique wouldn't work well if the data was 24-bit values and we only wanted half of them... the lookup table would be far too big to be practical.  On the other hand, we can combine the two techniques shown above: first shift the bits over, then index a lookup table.  For a 24-bit value that we only want the top half value, we could potentially shift the data right by 12 bits, and be left with a 12-bit value for a table index.  A 12-bit table index implies a table of 4096 values, which might be practical.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: One thing I forgot to put in.</p>\n\n<p>The technique of indexing into an array, instead of using an <code>if</code> statement, can be used for deciding which pointer to use.  I saw a library that implemented binary trees, and instead of having two named pointers (<code>pLeft</code> and <code>pRight</code> or whatever) had a length-2 array of pointers, and used the \"decision bit\" technique to decide which one to follow.

If these branches are inside loops and are hard to predict they can slow down execution significantly. Boolean variables are stored as 8-bit integers with the value <code>0</code> for <code>false</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>true</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Boolean variables are overdetermined in the sense that all operators that have Boolean variables as input check if the inputs have any other value than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, but operators that have Booleans as output can produce no other value than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. This makes operations with Boolean variables as input less efficient than necessary.\nConsider example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b, c, d;\nc = a &amp;&amp; b;\nd = a || b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is typically implemented by the compiler in the following way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b, c, d;\nif (a != 0) {\n    if (b != 0) {\n        c = 1;\n    }\n    else {\n        goto CFALSE;\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    CFALSE:\n    c = 0;\n}\nif (a == 0) {\n    if (b == 0) {\n        d = 0;\n    }\n    else {\n        goto DTRUE;\n    }\n}\nelse {\n    DTRUE:\n    d = 1;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code is far from optimal. The branches may take a long time in case of mispredictions. The Boolean operations can be made much more efficient if it is known with certainty that the operands have no other values than <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The reason why the compiler does not make such an assumption is that the variables might have other values if they are uninitialized or come from unknown sources. The above code can be optimized if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have been initialized to valid values or if they come from operators that produce Boolean output. The optimized code looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char a = 0, b = 1, c, d;\nc = a &amp; b;\nd = a | b;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>char</code> is used instead of <code>bool</code> in order to make it possible to use the bitwise operators (<code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code>) instead of the Boolean operators (<code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>). The bitwise operators are single instructions that take only one clock cycle. The OR operator (<code>|</code>) works even if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have other values than <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. The AND operator (<code>&amp;</code>) and the EXCLUSIVE OR operator (<code>^</code>) may give inconsistent results if the operands have other values than <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>~</code> can not be used for NOT. Instead, you can make a Boolean NOT on a variable which is known to be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> by XOR'ing it with <code>1</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bool a, b;\nb = !a;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can be optimized to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char a = 0, b;\nb = a ^ 1;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> cannot be replaced with <code>a &amp; b</code> if <code>b</code> is an expression that should not be evaluated if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code> ( <code>&amp;&amp;</code> will not evaluate <code>b</code>, <code>&amp;</code> will).

I've split the answer into two parts: Options for genuine arrays, and options for things that are just array-<em>like</em>, such as the <code>arguments</code> object, other iterable objects (ES2015+), DOM collections, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>I'll quickly note that you can use the ES2015 options <em>now</em>, even on ES5 engines, by <em>transpiling</em> ES2015 to ES5. Search for \"ES2015 transpiling\" / \"ES6 transpiling\" for more...</p>\n\n<p>Okay, let's look at our options:</p>\n\n<h2>For Actual Arrays</h2>\n\n<p>You have three options in <a href=\"http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/\">ECMAScript&nbsp;5</a> (\"ES5\"), the version most broadly supported at the moment, and will soon have two more in <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html\">ECMAScript&nbsp;2015</a> (\"ES2015\", \"ES6\"), the latest version of JavaScript that vendors are working on supporting:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use <code>forEach</code> and related (ES5+)</li>\n<li>Use a simple <code>for</code> loop</li>\n<li>Use <code>for-in</code> <em>correctly</em></li>\n<li>Use <code>for-of</code> (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)</li>\n<li>Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Details:</p>\n\n<h3>1. Use <code>forEach</code> and related</h3>\n\n<p>If you're using an environment that supports the <code>Array</code> features of ES5 (directly or using a shim), you can use the new <code>forEach</code> (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.foreach\"><code>spec</code></a> | <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\"><code>MDN</code></a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>var a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\na.forEach(function(entry) {\n    console.log(entry);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>forEach</code> accepts an iterator function and, optionally, a value to use as <code>this</code> when calling that iterator function (not used above). The iterator function is called for each entry in the array, in order, skipping non-existent entries in sparse arrays. Although I only used one argument above, the iterator function is called with three: The value of each entry, the index of that entry, and a reference to the array you're iterating over (in case your function doesn't already have it handy).</p>\n\n<p>Unless you're supporting obsolete browsers like IE8 (which NetApps shows at just over 4% market share as of this writing in September&nbsp;2016), you can happily use <code>forEach</code> in a general-purpose web page without a shim. If you do need to support obsolete browsers, shimming/polyfilling <code>forEach</code> is easily done (search for \"es5 shim\" for several options).</p>\n\n<p><code>forEach</code> has the benefit that you don't have to declare indexing and value variables in the containing scope, as they're supplied as arguments to the iteration function, and so nicely scoped to just that iteration.</p>\n\n<p>If you're worried about the runtime cost of making a function call for each array entry, don't be; <a href=\"http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2012/02/foreach-and-runtime-cost.html\">details</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <code>forEach</code> is the \"loop through them all\" function, but ES5 defined several other useful \"work your way through the array and do things\" functions, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.every\"><code>every</code></a> (stops looping the first time the iterator returns <code>false</code> or something falsey)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.some\"><code>some</code></a> (stops looping the first time the iterator returns <code>true</code> or something truthy)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.filter\"><code>filter</code></a> (creates a new array including elements where the filter function returns <code>true</code> and omitting the ones where it returns <code>false</code>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.map\"><code>map</code></a> (creates a new array from the values returned by the iterator function)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.reduce\"><code>reduce</code></a> (builds up a value by repeated calling the iterator, passing in previous values; see the spec for the details; useful for summing the contents of an array and many other things)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.reduceright\"><code>reduceRight</code></a> (like <code>reduce</code>, but works in descending rather than ascending order)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Use a simple <code>for</code> loop</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes the old ways are the best:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var index;\nvar a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (index = 0; index &lt; a.length; ++index) {\n    console.log(a[index]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If the length of the array won't change during the loop, and it's in performance-sensitive code (unlikely), a slightly more complicated version grabbing the length up front might be a <strong><em>tiny</em></strong> bit faster:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var index, len;\nvar a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (index = 0, len = a.length; index &lt; len; ++index) {\n    console.log(a[index]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And/or counting backward:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var index;\nvar a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (index = a.length - 1; index &gt;= 0; --index) {\n    console.log(a[index]);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But with modern JavaScript engines, it's rare you need to eke out that last bit of juice.</p>\n\n<p>In ES2015 and higher, you can make your index and value variables local to the <code>for</code> loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (let index = 0; index &lt; a.length; ++index) {\n    let value = a[index];\n}\n//console.log(index); // Would cause \"ReferenceError: index is not defined\"\n//console.log(value); // Would cause \"ReferenceError: value is not defined\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And when you do that, not just <code>value</code> but also <code>index</code> is recreated for each loop iteration, meaning closures created in the loop body keep a reference to the <code>index</code> (and <code>value</code>) created for that specific iteration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>let divs = Array.from(document.querySelector(\"div\"));\nfor (let index = 0; index &lt; divs.length; ++index) {\n    div[index].addEventListener(e =&gt; {\n        alert(\"Index is: \" + index);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you had five divs, you'd get \"Index is: 0\" if you clicked the first and \"Index is: 4\" if you clicked the last. This does <strong>not</strong> work if you use <code>var</code> instead of <code>let</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>3. Use <code>for-in</code> <em>correctly</em></h3>\n\n<p>You'll get people telling you to use <code>for-in</code>, but <a href=\"http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2010/11/myths-and-realities-of-forin.html\">that's not what <code>for-in</code> is for</a>. <code>for-in</code> loops through the <em>enumerable properties of an object</em>, not the indexes of an array. <strong>The order is not guaranteed</strong>, not even in ES2015 (ES6). ES2015 does define an order to object properties (via <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots-ownpropertykeys\"><code>[[OwnPropertyKeys]]</code></a>, <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots-enumerate\"><code>[[Enumerate]]</code></a>, and things that use them like <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-object.getownpropertynames\"><code>Object.getOwnPropertyKeys</code></a>), but it <strong>does not</strong> define that <code>for-in</code> will follow that order. (Details in <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/30919039/157247\">this other answer</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Still, it <em>can</em> be useful, particularly for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array\"><em>sparse</em> arrays</a>, if you use appropriate safeguards:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// `a` is a sparse array\nvar key;\nvar a = [];\na[0] = \"a\";\na[10] = \"b\";\na[10000] = \"c\";\nfor (key in a) {\n    if (a.hasOwnProperty(key)  &amp;&amp;        // These are explained\n        /^0$|^[1-9]\\d*$/.test(key) &amp;&amp;    // and then hidden\n        key &lt;= 4294967294                // away below\n        ) {\n        console.log(a[key]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note the two checks:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>That the object has its <em>own</em> property by that name (not one it inherits from its prototype), and</p></li>\n<li><p>That the key is a base-10 numeric string in its normal string form and its value is &lt;= 2^32 - 2 (which is 4,294,967,294). Where does that number come from? It's part of the definition of an array index <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4\">in the specification</a>. Other numbers (non-integers, negative numbers, numbers greater than 2^32 - 2) are not array indexes. The reason it's 2^32 - <strong>2</strong> is that that makes the greatest index value one lower than 2^32 - <strong>1</strong>, which is the maximum value an array's <code>length</code> can have. (E.g., an array's length fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer.) <em>(Props to RobG for pointing out in a comment <a href=\"http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2010/11/myths-and-realities-of-forin.html\">on my blog post</a> that my previous test wasn't quite right.)</em></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That's a tiny bit of added overhead per loop iteration on most arrays, but if you have a <em>sparse</em> array, it can be a more efficient way to loop because it only loops for entries that actually exist. E.g., for the array above, we loop a total of three times (for keys <code>\"0\"</code>, <code>\"10\"</code>, and <code>\"10000\"</code>&nbsp;&mdash; remember, they're strings), not 10,001 times.</p>\n\n<p>Now, you won't want to write that every time, so you might put this in your toolkit:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function arrayHasOwnIndex(array, prop) {\n    return array.hasOwnProperty(prop) &amp;&amp; /^0$|^[1-9]\\d*$/.test(prop) &amp;&amp; prop &lt;= 4294967294; // 2^32 - 2\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then we'd use it like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (key in a) {\n    if (arrayHasOwnIndex(a, key)) {\n        console.log(a[key]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or if you're interested in just a \"good enough for most cases\" test, you could use this, but while it's close, it's not quite correct:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (key in a) {\n    // \"Good enough\" for most cases\n    if (String(parseInt(key, 10)) === key &amp;&amp; a.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n        console.log(a[key]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>4. Use <code>for-of</code> (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)</h3>\n\n<p>ES2015 adds <em>iterators</em> to JavaScript. The easiest way to use iterators is the new <code>for-of</code> statement. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var val;\nvar a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (val of a) {\n    console.log(val);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Output:</p>\n\n<pre>\na\nb\nc\n</pre>\n\n<p>Under the covers, that gets an <em>iterator</em> from the array and loops through it, getting the values from it. This doesn't have the issue that using <code>for-in</code> has, because it uses an iterator defined by the object (the array), and arrays define that their iterators iterate through their <em>entries</em> (not their properties). Unlike <code>for-in</code> in ES5, the order in which the entries are visited is the numeric order of their indexes.</p>\n\n<h3>5. Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)</h3>\n\n<p>Sometimes, you might want to use an iterator <em>explicitly</em>. You can do that, too, although it's a lot clunkier than <code>for-of</code>. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var a = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nvar it = a.values();\nvar entry;\nwhile (!(entry = it.next()).done) {\n    console.log(entry.value);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The iterator is a function (specifically, a <em>generator</em>) that returns a new object each time you call <code>next</code>. The object returned by the iterator has a property, <code>done</code>, telling us whether it's done, and a property <code>value</code> with the value for that iteration.</p>\n\n<p>The meaning of <code>value</code> varies depending on the iterator; arrays support (at least) three functions that return iterators:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>values()</code>: This is the one I used above. It returns an iterator where each <code>value</code> is the value for that iteration.</li>\n<li><code>keys()</code>: Returns an iterator where each <code>value</code> is the key for that iteration (so for our <code>a</code> above, that would be <code>\"0\"</code>, then <code>\"1\"</code>, then <code>\"2\"</code>).</li>\n<li><code>entries()</code>: Returns an iterator where each <code>value</code> is an array in the form <code>[key, value]</code> for that iteration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(As of this writing, Firefox 29 supports <code>entries</code> and <code>keys</code> but not <code>values</code>.)</p>\n\n<h2>For Array-Like Objects</h2>\n\n<p>Aside from true arrays, there are also <em>array-like</em> objects that have a <code>length</code> property and properties with numeric names: <code>NodeList</code> instances, the <code>arguments</code> object, etc. How do we loop through their contents?</p>\n\n<h3>Use any of the options above for arrays</h3>\n\n<p>At least some, and possibly most or even all, of the array approaches above frequently apply equally well to array-like objects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Use <code>forEach</code> and related (ES5+)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The various functions on <code>Array.prototype</code> are \"intentionally generic\" and can usually be used on array-like objects via <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-function.prototype.call\"><code>Function#call</code></a> or <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-function.prototype.apply\"><code>Function#apply</code></a>. (See the <em>Caveat for host-provided objects</em> at the end of this answer, but it's a rare issue.)</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you wanted to use <code>forEach</code> on a <code>Node</code>'s <code>childNodes</code> property. You'd do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Array.prototype.forEach.call(node.childNodes, function(child) {\n    // Do something with `child`\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you're going to do that a lot, you might want to grab a copy of the function reference into a variable for reuse, e.g.:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// (This is all presumably in some scoping function)\nvar forEach = Array.prototype.forEach;\n\n// Then later...\nforEach.call(node.childNodes, function(child) {\n    // Do something with `child`\n});\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use a simple <code>for</code> loop</strong></p>\n\n<p>Obviously, a simple <code>for</code> loop applies to array-like objects.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use <code>for-in</code> <em>correctly</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><code>for-in</code> with the same safeguards as with an array should work with array-like objects as well; the caveat for host-provided objects on #1 above may apply.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use <code>for-of</code> (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)</strong></p>\n\n<p><code>for-of</code> will use the iterator provided by the object (if any); we'll have to see how this plays with the various array-like objects, particularly host-provided ones.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)</strong></p>\n\n<p>See #4, we'll have to see how iterators play out.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Create a true array</h3>\n\n<p>Other times, you may want to convert an array-like object into a true array. Doing that is surprisingly easy:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Use the <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.prototype.slice\"><code>slice</code></a> method of arrays</strong></p>\n\n<p>We can use the <code>slice</code> method of arrays, which like the other methods mentioned above is \"intentionally generic\" and so can be used with array-like objects, like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var trueArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrayLikeObject);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So for instance, if we want to convert a <code>NodeList</code> into a true array, we could do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var divs = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(\"div\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See the <em>Caveat for host-provided objects</em> below. In particular, note that this will fail in IE8 and earlier, which don't let you use host-provided objects as <code>this</code> like that.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator\">spread operator (<code>...</code>)</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>It's also possible to use the ES2015 <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator\">spread operator</a>, with JavaScript engines that support this feature:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var trueArray = [...iterableObject];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So for instance, if we want to convert a <code>NodeList</code> into a true array, with spread syntax this becomes quite succinct:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var divs = [...document.querySelectorAll(\"div\")];\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p><strong>Use <code>Array.from</code></strong> <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-array.from\">(spec)</a> | <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from\">(MDN)</a></p>\n\n<p><code>Array.from</code> (ES2015, but shimmable) creates an array from an array-like object, optionally passing the entries through a mapping function first. So:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\"div\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or if you wanted to get an array of the tag names of the elements with a given class, you'd use the mapping function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Arrow function (ES2015):\nvar divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\".some-class\"), element =&gt; element.tagName);\n\n// Standard function (since `Array.from` can be shimmed):\nvar divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\".some-class\"), function(element) {\n    return element.tagName;\n});\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Caveat for host-provided objects</h3>\n\n<p>If you use <code>Array.prototype</code> functions with <em>host-provided</em> array-like objects (DOM lists and other things provided by the browser rather than the JavaScript engine), you need to be sure to test in your target environments to make sure the host-provided object behaves properly. <strong>Most do behave properly</strong> (now), but it's important to test. The reason is that most of the <code>Array.prototype</code> methods you're likely to want to use rely on the host-provided object giving an honest answer to the abstract <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.6.2\"><code>[[HasProperty]]</code></a> operation. As of this writing, browsers do a very good job of this, but the ES5 spec did allow for the possibility a host-provided object may not be honest; it's in <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.6.2\">\u00a78.6.2</a> (several paragraphs below the big table near the beginning of that section), where it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Host objects may implement these internal methods in any manner unless specified otherwise; for example, one possibility is that <code>[[Get]]</code> and <code>[[Put]]</code> for a particular host object indeed fetch and store property values but <code>[[HasProperty]]</code> always generates <strong>false</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I couldn't find the equivalent verbiage in the ES2015 spec, but it's bound to still be the case.) Again, as of this writing the common host-provided array-like objects in modern browsers (<code>NodeList</code> instances, for instance) <strong>do</strong> handle <code>[[HasProperty]]</code> correctly, but it's important to test.</p>\n", "title": "For-each over an array in JavaScript?", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "loops", "foreach", "iteration"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript/9329476#9329476", "question_id": 9329446, "answer_id": 9329476}, {"body": "<p><strong>Edit</strong>: This answer is hopelessly out-of-date.

In this case, a <code>for .. in</code>-loop might be a better idea. <strong>However</strong>, you must use the appropriate safeguards to ensure that only the desired properties of the array (that is, the array elements) are acted upon, since the <code>for..in</code>-loop will also be enumerated in legacy browsers, or if the additional properties are defined as <code>enumerable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ECMAScript.2C_5th_Edition\">ECMAScript 5</a> there will be a forEach method on the array prototype, but it is not supported in legacy browsers. So to be able to use it consistently you must either have an environment that supports it (for example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js\">Node.js</a> for server side JavaScript), or use a \"Polyfill\".

So in fact another construct would be needed to accurately express the \"don't care\" intent, something currently unavailable in most languages, including ECMAScript, but which could be called, for example, <code>forEachUnordered()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>If order doesn't matter, and <strong>efficiency</strong> is a concern (in the innermost loop of a game or animation engine), then it may be acceptable to use the reverse for loop as your go-to pattern.  Just remember that seeing a reverse for loop in existing code <strong>does not necessarily mean</strong> that the order irrelevant!</p>\n\n<h3>It is better to use forEach()</h3>\n\n<p>In general for higher level code where <strong>clarity and safety</strong> are greater concerns, I would recommend using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach\"><code>Array::forEach</code></a> as your default pattern:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is clear to read.</li>\n<li>It indicates that <em>i</em> is not going to be shifted within the block (which is always a possible surprise hiding in long <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops.)</li>\n<li>It gives you a free scope for closures.</li>\n<li>It reduces leakage of local variables and accidental collision with (and mutation of) outer variables.</li>\n<li>But note that unlike <code>map</code>, <code>forEach</code> <strong>does not</strong> exclude the possibility that the loop will <strong>break</strong> out part-way through.  This is a feature that can be triggered by returning <em>false</em> from the callback.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Then when you do see the reverse for loop in your code, that is a hint that it is reversed for a good reason (perhaps one of the reasons described above).  And seeing a traditional forward for loop may indicate that shifting can take place.</p>\n\n<p>(If the discussion of intent makes no sense to you, then you and your code may benefit from watching Crockford's lecture on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaEzHI9xyY&amp;t=480\">Programming Style &amp; Your Brain</a>.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i=0; i&lt;array.length; i++) { ... }   // Forwards\n\nfor (var i=array.length; i--; )    { ... }   // Reverse\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You will notice that <code>i--</code> is the middle clause (where we usually see a comparison) and the last clause is empty (where we usually see <code>i++</code>).  That means that <code>i--</code> is also used as the <em>condition</em> for continuation.  Crucially, it is executed and checked <em>before</em> each iteration.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>How can it start at <code>array.length</code> without exploding?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Because <code>i--</code> runs <em>before</em> each iteration, on the first iteration we will actually be accessing the item at <code>array.length-1</code> which avoids any issues with <strike>Array-out-of-bounds</strike> <code>undefined</code> items.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Why doesn't it stop iterating before index 0?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The loop will stop iterating when the condition <code>i--</code> evaluates to a falsey value (when it yields 0).</p>\n\n<p>The trick is that unlike <code>--i</code>, the trailing <code>i--</code> operator decrements <code>i</code> but yields the value <strong><em>before</em></strong> the decrement.  Your console can demonstrate this:</p>\n\n<p><code>&gt; var i = 5; [i, i--, i];</code></p>\n\n<p><code>[5, 5, 4]</code></p>\n\n<p>So on the final iteration, <em>i</em> was previously <strong>1</strong> and the <code>i--</code> expression changes it to <strong>0</strong> but actually yields <strong>1</strong> (truthy), and so the condition passes.  On the next iteration <code>i--</code> changes <em>i</em> to <strong>-1</strong> but yields <strong>0</strong> (falsey), causing execution to immediately drop out of the bottom of the loop.</p>\n\n<p>In the traditional forwards for loop, <code>i++</code> and <code>++i</code> are interchangeable (as Douglas Crockford points out).  However in the reverse for loop, because our decrement is also our condition expression, we must stick with <code>i--</code> if we want to process the item at index 0.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Trivia</h2>\n\n<p>Some people like to draw a little arrow in the reverse <code>for</code> loop, and end with a wink:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for (var i=array.length; i --&gt; 0 ;) {\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Credits go to WYL for showing me the benefits and horrors of the reverse for loop.</em></p>\n", "title": "For-each over an array in JavaScript?", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "loops", "foreach", "iteration"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript/23430396#23430396", "question_id": 9329446, "answer_id": 23430396}, {"body": "<p>I know this is an old post, and there are so many great answers already.

The first argument is the object (array) to iterate over, the second argument is the iterator function, and the optional third argument is the object context (basically referred to inside the loop as 'this'.</p>\n\n<p>There are different ways to use the forEach loop of angular. The simplest and probably most used is</p>\n\n<pre><code>var temp = [1, 2, 3];\nangular.forEach(temp, function(item) {\n    //item will be each element in the array\n    //do something\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Another way that is useful for copying items from one array to another is</p>\n\n<pre><code>var temp = [1, 2, 3];\nvar temp2 = [];\nangular.forEach(temp, function(item) {\n    this.push(item); //\"this\" refers to the array passed into the optional third parameter so, in this case, temp2.\n}, temp2);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Though, you don't have to do that, you can simply do the following and it's equivalent to the previous example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.forEach(temp, function(item) {\n    temp2.push(item);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now there are pros and cons of using the <code>angular.forEach</code> function as opposed to the built in vanilla-flavored <code>for</code> loop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Easy readability</li>\n<li>Easy writability</li>\n<li>If available, <code>angular.forEach</code> will use the ES5 forEach loop. Now, I will get to efficientcy in the cons section, as the forEach loops are <em>much</em> slower than the for loops. I mention this as a pro because it's nice to be consistent and standardized.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Consider the following 2 nested loops, which do exactly the same thing. Let's say that we have 2 arrays of objects and each object contains an array of results, each of which has a Value property that's a string (or whatever). And let's say we need to iterate over each of the results and if they're equal then perform some action: </p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.forEach(obj1.results, function(result1) {\n    angular.forEach(obj2.results, function(result2) {\n        if (result1.Value === result2.Value) {\n            //do something\n        }\n    });\n});\n\n//exact same with a for loop\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; obj1.results.length; i++) {\n    for (var j = 0; j &lt; obj2.results.length; j++) {\n        if (obj1.results[i].Value === obj2.results[j].Value) {\n            //do something\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Granted this is a very simple hypothetical example, but I've written triple embedded for loops using the second approach and it was <em>very</em> hard to read, and write for that matter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Efficiency. <code>angular.forEach</code>, and the native <code>forEach</code>, for that matter, are both <em>so much</em> slower than the normal <code>for</code> loop....about <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/angular-foreach-vs-native-for-loop/3\">90% slower</a>. So for large data sets, best to stick to the native <code>for</code> loop.</li>\n<li>No break, continue, or return support. <code>continue</code> is actually supported by \"<a href=\"https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/263\">accident</a>\", to continue in an <code>angular.forEach</code> you simple put a <code>return;</code> statement in the function like <code>angular.forEach(array, function(item) { if (someConditionIsTrue) return; });</code> which will cause it to continue out of the function for that iteration. This is also due to the fact that the native <code>forEach</code> does not support break or continue either.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm sure there's various other pros and cons as well, and please feel free to add any that you see fit. I feel that, bottom line, if you need efficiency, stick with just the native <code>for</code> loop for your looping needs. But, if your datasets are smaller and a some efficiency is okay to give up in exchange for readability and writability, then by all means throw an <code>angular.forEach</code> in that bad boy.</p>\n", "title": "For-each over an array in JavaScript?", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "loops", "foreach", "iteration"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript/24336808#24336808", "question_id": 9329446, "answer_id": 24336808}, {"body": "<p>Use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.each([ 52, 97 ], function( index, value ) {\n    alert( index + \": \" + value );\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>where <code>[ 52, 97 ]</code> is your array.</p>\n\n<p>This produces two messages:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0: 52\n1: 97\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>$.each()</code> is essentially a drop-in replacement of a traditional <code>for</code> or <code>for-in</code> loop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>// **Traditional JavaScript code**\n\nvar sum = 0;\nvar arr = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];\n\nfor ( var i = 0, l = arr.length; i &lt; l; i++ ) {\n    sum += arr[ i ];\n}\nconsole.log( sum ); // 15\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It can be <strong>replaced with this using jQuery</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.each( arr, function( index, value ){\n    sum += value;\n});\nconsole.log( sum ); // 15\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Using JavaScript</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>var myStringArray = [\"Hello\",\"World\"];\nvar arrayLength = myStringArray.length;\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; arrayLength; i++) {\n    alert(myStringArray[i]);\n    //Do something\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "For-each over an array in JavaScript?", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "loops", "foreach", "iteration"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript/25738017#25738017", "question_id": 9329446, "answer_id": 25738017}, {"body": "<p>I think that the best and standard way is to use the <code>for</code> loop, and I like the <strong>short way</strong> to write it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var list = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nfor (var i = 0, letter; letter=list[i]; i++) {\n     alert(letter) ;\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "For-each over an array in JavaScript?", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "loops", "foreach", "iteration"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript/26408750#26408750", "question_id": 9329446, "answer_id": 26408750}, {"body": "<p>Another thing about <code>array.forEach</code>. \nYou not only get <code>index</code>, but also the <em>iterated object</em> with <code>forEach</code> when  you work with an array of objects.

This is basic dirty-checking. If there is a change in value, then it fires the change event.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>$apply()</code> method, which is what you call when you are transitioning from a non-AngularJS world into an AngularJS world, calls <code>$digest()</code>. A digest is just plain old dirty-checking. It works on all browsers and is totally predictable.</p>\n\n<p>To contrast dirty-checking (AngularJS) vs change listeners (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KnockoutJS\">KnockoutJS</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone.js\">Backbone.js</a>): While dirty-checking may seem simple, and even inefficient (I will address that later), it turns out that it is semantically correct all the time, while change listeners have lots of weird corner cases and need things like dependency tracking to make it more semantically correct. KnockoutJS dependency tracking is a clever feature for a problem which AngularJS does not have.</p>\n\n<h1>Issues with change listeners:</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The syntax is atrocious, since browsers do not support it natively. Yes, there are proxies, but they are not semantically correct in all cases, and of course there are no proxies on old browsers. The bottom line is that dirty-checking allows you to do <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object\">POJO</a>, whereas KnockoutJS and Backbone.js force you to inherit from their classes, and access your data through accessors.</li>\n<li>Change coalescence. Suppose you have an array of items. Say you want to add items into an array, as you are looping to add, each time you add you are firing events on change, which is rendering the UI. This is very bad for performance. What you want is to update the UI only once, at the end. The change events are too fine-grained.</li>\n<li>Change listeners fire immediately on a setter, which is a problem, since the change listener can further change data, which fires more change events. This is bad since on your stack you may have several change events happening at once. Suppose you have two arrays which need to be kept in sync for whatever reason. You can only add to one or the other, but each time you add you fire a change event, which now has an inconsistent view of the world. This is a very similar problem to thread locking, which JavaScript avoids since each callback executes exclusively and to completion. Change events break this since setters can have far-reaching consequences which are not intended and non obvious, which creates the thread problem all over again. It turns out that what you want to do is to delay the listener execution, and guarantee, that only one listener runs at a time, hence any code is free to change data, and it knows that no other code runs while it is doing so.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>What about performance?</h1>\n\n<p>So it may seem that we are slow, since dirty-checking is inefficient. This is where we need to look at real numbers rather than just have theoretical arguments, but first let's define some constraints.</p>\n\n<p>Humans are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>Slow</em> \u2014 Anything faster than 50&nbsp;ms is imperceptible to humans and thus can be considered as \"instant\".</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Limited</em> \u2014 You can't really show more than about 2000 pieces of information to a human on a single page. Anything more than that is really bad UI, and humans can't process this anyway.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So the real question is this: How many comparisons can you do on a browser in 50&nbsp;ms? This is a hard question to answer as many factors come into play, but here is a test case: <a href=\"http://jsperf.com/angularjs-digest/6\">http://jsperf.com/angularjs-digest/6</a> which creates 10,000 watchers. On a modern browser this takes just under 6&nbsp;ms. On <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8\">Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;8</a> it takes about 40&nbsp;ms. As you can see, this is not an issue even on slow browsers these days. There is a caveat: The comparisons need to be simple to fit into the time limit... Unfortunately it is way too easy to add a slow comparison into AngularJS, so it is easy to build slow applications when you don't know what you are doing. But we hope to have an answer by providing an instrumentation module, which would show you which are the slow comparisons.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that video games and GPUs use the dirty-checking approach, specifically because it is consistent. As long as they get over the monitor refresh rate (typically 50-60 Hz, or every 16.6-20 ms), any performance over that is a waste, so you're better off drawing more stuff, than getting FPS higher.</p>\n", "title": "How does data binding work in AngularJS?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "data-binding"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9682092/how-does-data-binding-work-in-angularjs/9693933#9693933", "question_id": 9682092, "answer_id": 9693933}, {"body": "<p>I wondered this myself for a while. Without setters how does AngularJS notice changes to the <code>$scope</code> object? Does it poll them?</p>\n\n<p>What it actually does is this: Any \"normal\" place you modify the model was already called from the guts of AngularJS, so it automatically calls <code>$apply</code> for you after your code runs. Say your controller has a method that's hooked up to <code>ng-click</code> on some element. Because AngularJS wires the calling of that method together for you, it has a chance to do an <code>$apply</code> in the appropriate place. Likewise for expressions that appear right in the views, those are executed by AngularJS so it does the <code>$apply</code>.</p>\n\n<p>When the documentation talk about having to call <code>$apply</code> manually for code <em>outside of AngularJS</em>, it's talking about code which, when run, doesn't stem from AngularJS itself in the call stack.</p>\n", "title": "How does data binding work in AngularJS?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "data-binding"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9682092/how-does-data-binding-work-in-angularjs/12252150#12252150", "question_id": 9682092, "answer_id": 12252150}, {"body": "<p>Misko already gave an excellent description of how the data bindings work, but I would like to add my view on the performance issue with the data binding.</p>\n\n<p>As Misko stated, around 2000 bindings is where you start to see problems, but you shouldn't have more than 2000 pieces of information on a page anyway. This may be true, but not every data-binding is visible to the user. Once you start building any sort of widget or data grid with two-way binding you can <em>easily</em> hit 2000 bindings, without having a bad ux.</p>\n\n<p>Consider, for example, a combobox where you can type text to filter the available options. This sort of control could have ~150 items and still be highly usable. If it has some extra feature (for example a specific class on the currently selected option) you start to get 3-5 bindings per option. Put three of these widgets on a page (e.g. one to select a country, the other to select a city in said country, and the third to select a hotel) and you are somewhere between 1000 and 2000 bindings already.</p>\n\n<p>Or consider a data-grid in a corporate web application. 50 rows per page is not unreasonable, each of which could have 10-20 columns. If you build this with ng-repeats, and/or have information in some cells which uses some bindings, you could be approaching 2000 bindings with this grid alone.</p>\n\n<p>I find this to be a <strong>huge</strong> problem when working with AngularJS, and the only solution I've been able to find so far is to construct widgets without using two-way binding, instead using ngOnce, deregistering watchers and similar tricks, or construct directives which builds the DOM with jQuery and DOM manipulation. I feel this defeats the purpose of using Angular in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I would love to hear suggestions on other ways to handle this, but then maybe I should write my own question.

For each $scope object, we iterate over its $$watchers array and evaluate all the expressions. If the new expression value is different from the last known value, the watcher's function is called. This function might recompile part of the DOM, recompute a value on $scope, trigger an AJAX request, anything you need it to do.</p>\n\n<p>Every scope is traversed and every watch expression evaluated and checked against the last value.</p>\n\n<h2>If a watcher is triggered, the $scope is dirty</h2>\n\n<p>If a watcher is triggered, the app knows something has changed, and the $scope is marked as dirty.</p>\n\n<p>Watcher functions can change other attributes on $scope or on a parent $scope.

For a developer this is a massive productivity boon, as you now need to write almost no wiring code, Angular will just notice if a value has changed.</p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of the machine though this is wildly inefficient and will slow our app down if we create too many watchers.

You can mitigate against this using features like one-time binding to compile a template without creating watchers.</p>\n", "title": "How does data binding work in AngularJS?", "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "data-binding"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9682092/how-does-data-binding-work-in-angularjs/30596164#30596164", "question_id": 9682092, "answer_id": 30596164}, {"body": "<p>Here is an example of data binding with AngularJS, using an input field.

When $digest() iterates over the watches, it checks if the value of the expression has changed. If the value\nhas changed, AngularJS calls the listener with the new value and the old value.\nThe $digest() function is called whenever AngularJS thinks it is necessary.

The $digest cycle starts as a result of a call to $scope.$digest(). Assume that you change a $scope model in a handler function through the ng-click directive. In that case AngularJS automatically triggers a $digest cycle by calling $digest().In addition to ng-click, there are several other built-in directives/services that let you change models (e.g. ng-model, $timeout, etc) and automatically trigger a $digest cycle.  The rough implementation of $digest looks like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Scope.prototype.$digest = function() {\n      var dirty;\n      do {\n          dirty = this.$$digestOnce();\n      } while (dirty);\n}\nScope.prototype.$$digestOnce = function() {\n   var self = this;\n   var newValue, oldValue, dirty;\n   _.forEach(this.$$watchers, function(watcher) {\n          newValue = watcher.watchFn(self);\n          oldValue = watcher.last;   // It just remembers the last value for dirty checking\n          if (newValue !== oldValue) { //Dirty checking of References \n   // For Deep checking the object , code of Value     \n   // based checking of Object should be implemented here\n             watcher.last = newValue;\n             watcher.listenerFn(newValue,\n                  (oldValue === initWatchVal ? newValue : oldValue),\n                   self);\n          dirty = true;\n          }\n     });\n   return dirty;\n };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If we use JavaScript\u2019s <strong>setTimeout()</strong> function to update a scope model, Angular has no way of knowing what you might change. In this case it\u2019s our responsibility to call $apply() manually, which triggers a $digest cycle. Similarly, if you have a directive that sets up a DOM event listener and changes some models inside the handler function, you need to call $apply() to ensure the changes take effect. The big idea of $apply is that we can execute some code that isn't aware of Angular, that code may still change things on the scope.

Once eliminated (using a <code>int ai=0;float a=ai;</code> and using <code>a</code> instead of <code>0</code>), the speed difference remains. So @Mysticial is right, the denormalized floats make the difference. This can be seen by testing values between <code>0</code> and <code>0.1f</code>. The turning point in the above code is approximately at <code>0.00000000000000000000000000000001</code>, when the loops suddenly takes 10 times as long.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update&lt;&lt;1</strong> </p>\n\n<p>A small visualisation of this interesting phenomenon:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Column 1: a float, divided by 2 for every iteration</li>\n<li>Column 2: the binary representation of this float</li>\n<li>Column 3: the time taken to sum this float 1e7 times</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can clearly see the exponent (the last 9 bits) change to its lowest value, when denormalization sets in.

This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of \"this is how you loop an array with <code>foreach</code>\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For a long time I assumed that <code>foreach</code> worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.</p>\n\n<p>Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9\">Test case 1</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  $array[] = $item;\n}\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh\">Test case 2</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nprint_r($array);\n\n/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5\n   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. <em>But...</em></p>\n\n<p>If we look in the <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php\">manual</a>, we find this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right... this seems to suggest that <code>foreach</code> relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're <em>not working with the source array</em>, right? Well, not entirely.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy\">Test case 3</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\nforeach ($array as $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n}\n\nvar_dump(each($array));\n\n/* Output\n  array(4) {\n    [1]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    [\"value\"]=&gt;\n    int(1)\n    [0]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n    [\"key\"]=&gt;\n    int(0)\n  }\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n  bool(false)\n*/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then <a href=\"http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9\">test case 1</a> would loop forever.</p>\n\n<p>The PHP manual also states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let's find out what that \"unexpected behavior\" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd\">Test case 4</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  each($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL\">Test case 5</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {\n  echo \"$item\\n\";\n  reset($array);\n}\n\n/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the \"copy of source\" theory.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is going on here?

In all other examples you modify either the contents or the internal array pointer. This is important when it comes to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP\">PHP</a> arrays because of the semantics of the assignment operator.</p>\n\n<p>The assignment operator for the arrays in PHP works more like a lazy clone. Assigning one variable to another that contains an array will clone the array, unlike most languages. However, the actual cloning will not be done unless it is needed. This means that the clone will take place only when either of the variables is modified (copy-on-write).</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$a = array(1,2,3);\n$b = $a;  // This is lazy cloning of $a. For the time\n          // being $a and $b point to the same internal\n          // data structure.\n\n$a[] = 3; // Here $a changes, which triggers the actual\n          // cloning. From now on, $a and $b are two\n          // different data structures. The same would\n          // happen if there were a change in $b.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Coming back to your test cases, you can easily imagine that <code>foreach</code> creates some kind of iterator with a reference to the array. This reference works exactly like the variable <code>$b</code> in my example. However, the iterator along with the reference live only during the loop and then, they are both discarded. Now you can see that, in all cases but 3, the array is modified during the loop, while this extra reference is alive. This triggers a clone, and that explains what's going on here!</p>\n\n<p>Here is an excellent article for another side effect of this copy-on-write behaviour: <a href=\"http://fabien.potencier.org/article/48/the-php-ternary-operator-fast-or-not\">The PHP Ternary Operator: Fast or not?</a></p>\n", "title": "How does &#39;foreach&#39; actually work?", "tags": ["php", "loops", "foreach", "iteration", "php-internals"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057671/how-does-foreach-actually-work/10058215#10058215", "question_id": 10057671, "answer_id": 10058215}, {"body": "<p>Some points to note when working with <code>foreach()</code>:</p>\n\n<p>a) <code>foreach</code> works on the <strong>prospected copy</strong> of the original array.\n    It means foreach() will have SHARED data storage until or unless a <code>prospected copy</code> is\n    not created <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php\">foreach Notes/User comments</a>.</p>\n\n<p>b) What triggers a <strong>prospected copy</strong>?\n    Prospected copy is created based on the policy of <code>copy-on-write</code>, that is, whenever\n    an array passed to foreach() is changed, a clone of original array is created.</p>\n\n<p>c) The original array and foreach() iterator will have <code>DISTINCT SENTINEL VARIABLES</code>, that is, one for the original array and other for foreach; see the test code below. <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/book.spl.php\">SPL</a> , <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/spl.iterators.php\">Iterators</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.arrayiterator.php\">Array Iterator</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Stack&nbsp;Overflow question <em><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2728709\">How to make sure the value is reset in a 'foreach' loop in PHP?</a></em> addresses the  cases (3,4,5) of your question.</p>\n\n<p>The following example show that each() and reset() DOES NOT affect <code>SENTINEL</code> variables\n<code>(for example, the current index variable)</code> of the foreach() iterator.</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n\nlist($key2, $val2) = each($array);\necho \"each() Original (outside): $key2 =&gt; $val2&lt;br/&gt;\";\n\nforeach($array as $key =&gt; $val){\n    echo \"foreach: $key =&gt; $val&lt;br/&gt;\";\n\n    list($key2,$val2) = each($array);\n    echo \"each() Original(inside): $key2 =&gt; $val2&lt;br/&gt;\";\n\n    echo \"--------Iteration--------&lt;br/&gt;\";\n    if ($key == 3){\n        echo \"Resetting original array pointer&lt;br/&gt;\";\n        reset($array);\n    }\n}\n\nlist($key2, $val2) = each($array);\necho \"each() Original (outside): $key2 =&gt; $val2&lt;br/&gt;\";\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>each() Original (outside): 0 =&gt; 1\nforeach: 0 =&gt; 1\neach() Original(inside): 1 =&gt; 2\n--------Iteration--------\nforeach: 1 =&gt; 2\neach() Original(inside): 2 =&gt; 3\n--------Iteration--------\nforeach: 2 =&gt; 3\neach() Original(inside): 3 =&gt; 4\n--------Iteration--------\nforeach: 3 =&gt; 4\neach() Original(inside): 4 =&gt; 5\n--------Iteration--------\nResetting original array pointer\nforeach: 4 =&gt; 5\neach() Original(inside): 0=&gt;1\n--------Iteration--------\neach() Original (outside): 1 =&gt; 2\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How does &#39;foreach&#39; actually work?", "tags": ["php", "loops", "foreach", "iteration", "php-internals"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057671/how-does-foreach-actually-work/10058358#10058358", "question_id": 10057671, "answer_id": 10058358}, {"body": "<p><code>foreach</code> supports iteration over three different kinds of values:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Arrays</li>\n<li>Normal objects</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://php.net/Traversable\"><code>Traversable</code></a> objects</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the following I will try to explain precisely how iteration works in the different cases. By far the simplest case are <code>Traversable</code> objects, as for these <code>foreach</code> is essentially only syntax sugar for code along these lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($it as $k =&gt; $v) { /* ... */ }\n\n/* translates to: */\n\nif ($it instanceof IteratorAggregate) {\n    $it = $it-&gt;getIterator();\n}\nfor ($it-&gt;rewind(); $it-&gt;valid(); $it-&gt;next()) {\n    $v = $it-&gt;current();\n    $k = $it-&gt;key();\n    /* ... */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For internal classes actual method calls are avoided by using an internal API that essentially just mirrors the <code>Iterator</code> interface on the C level.</p>\n\n<p>Iteration of arrays and plain objects is significantly more complicated. First of all, it should be noted that in PHP \"arrays\" are really ordered dictionaries and they will be traversed according to this order (which matches the insertion order as long as you didn't use something like <code>sort</code>). This is opposed to iterating by the natural order of the keys (how lists in other languages often work) or having no defined order at all (how dictionaries in other languages often work).</p>\n\n<p>The same also applies to objects, as the object properties can be seen as another (ordered) dictionary mapping property names to their values, plus some visibility handling. In the majority of cases the object properties are not actually stored in this rather inefficient way. However if you start iterating over an object, the packed representation that is normally used will be converted to a real dictionary. At that point, iteration of plain objects becomes very similar to iteration of arrays (which is why I'm not discussing plain-object iteration much in here).</p>\n\n<p>So far, so good. Iterating over a dictionary can't be too hard, right? The problems begin when you realize that an array/object can change during iteration. There are multiple ways this can happen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you iterate by reference using <code>foreach ($arr as &amp;$v)</code> then <code>$arr</code> is turned into a reference and you can change it during iteration.</li>\n<li>In PHP 5 the same applies even if you iterate by value, but the array was a reference beforehand: <code>$ref =&amp; $arr; foreach ($ref as $v)</code></li>\n<li>Objects have by-handle passing semantics, which for must practical purposes means that they behave like references. So objects can always be changed during iteration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem with allowing modifications during iteration is the case where the element you are currently on is removed. Say you use a pointer to keep track of which array element you are currently at. If this element is now freed, you are left with a dangling pointer (usually resulting in a segfault).</p>\n\n<p>There are different ways of solving this issue. PHP 5 and PHP 7 differ significantly in this regard and I'll describe both behaviors in the following. The summary is that PHP 5's approach was rather dumb and lead to all kinds of weird edge-case issues, while PHP 7's more involved approach results in more predictable and consistent behavior.</p>\n\n<p>As a last preliminary, it should be noted that PHP uses reference counting and copy-on-write to manage memory. This means that if you \"copy\" a value, you actually just reuse the old value and increment its reference count (refcount). Only once you perform some kind of modification a real copy (called a \"duplication\") will be done. See <a href=\"http://blog.golemon.com/2007/01/youre-being-lied-to.html\">You're being lied to</a> for a more extensive introduction on this topic.</p>\n\n<h2>PHP 5</h2>\n\n<h3>Internal array pointer and HashPointer</h3>\n\n<p>Arrays in PHP 5 have one dedicated \"internal array pointer\" (IAP), which properly supports modifications: Whenever an element is removed, there will be a check whether the IAP points to this element. If it does, it is advanced to the next element instead.</p>\n\n<p>While foreach does make use of the IAP, there is an additional complication: There is only one IAP, but one array can be be part of multiple foreach loops:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// Using by-ref iteration here to make sure that it's really\n// the same array in both loops and not a copy\nforeach ($arr as &amp;$v1) {\n    foreach ($arr as &amp;$v) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To support two simultaneous loops with only one internal array pointer, foreach performs the following schenanigans: Before the loop body is executed, foreach will back up a pointer to the current element and its hash into a per-foreach <code>HashPointer</code>. After the loop body runs, the IAP will be set back to this element if it still exists. If however the element has been removed, we'll just use whereever the IAP is currently at. This scheme mostly-kinda-sortof works, but there's a lot of weird behavior you can get out of it, some of which I'll demonstrate below.</p>\n\n<h3>Array duplication</h3>\n\n<p>The IAP is a visible feature of an array (exposed through the <code>current</code> family of functions), as such changes to the IAP count as modifications under copy-on-write semantics. This unfortunately means that foreach is in many cases forced to duplicate the array it is iterating over. The precise conditions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The array is not a reference (is_ref=0). If it's a reference, then changes to it are <em>supposed</em> to propagate, so it should not be duplicated.</li>\n<li>The array has refcount>1. If refcount is 1, then the array is not shared and we're free to modify it directly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If the array is not duplicated (is_ref=0, refcount=1), then only its refcount will be incremented (*). Additionally, if foreach by reference is used, then the (potentially duplicated) array will be turned into a reference.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this code as an example where duplication occurs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function iterate($arr) {\n    foreach ($arr as $v) {}\n}\n\n$outerArr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];\niterate($arr);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, <code>$arr</code> will be duplicated to prevent IAP changes on <code>$arr</code> from leaking to <code>$outerArr</code>. In terms of the conditions above, the array is not a reference (is_ref=0) and is used in two places (refcount=2). This requirement is unfortunate and an artifact of the suboptimal implementation (there is no concern of modification during iteration here, so we don't really need to use the IAP in the first place).</p>\n\n<p>(*) Incrementing the refcount here sounds innocuous, but violates copy-on-write (COW) semantics: This means that we are going to modify the IAP of a refcount=2 array, while COW dictates that modifications can only be performed on refcount=1 values. This violation results in user-visible behavior change (while COW is normally transparent), because the IAP change on the iterated array will be observable -- but only until the first non-IAP modification on the array. Instead, the three \"valid\" options would have been a) to always duplicate, b) to not increment the refcount and thus allowing the iterated array to be arbitrarily modified in the loop, or c) don't use the IAP at all (the PHP 7 solution).</p>\n\n<h3>Position advancement order</h3>\n\n<p>There is one last implementation detail that you have to be aware of to properly understand the code samples below. The \"normal\" way of looping through some data structure would look something like this in pseudocode:</p>\n\n<pre><code>reset(arr);\nwhile (get_current_data(arr, &amp;data) == SUCCESS) {\n    code();\n    move_forward(arr);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However <code>foreach</code>, being a rather special snowflake, chooses to do things slightly differently:</p>\n\n<pre><code>reset(arr);\nwhile (get_current_data(arr, &amp;data) == SUCCESS) {\n    move_forward(arr);\n    code();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Namely, the array pointer is already moved forward <em>before</em> the loop body runs. This means that while the loop body is working on element <code>$i</code>, the IAP is already at element <code>$i+1</code>. This is the reason why code samples showing modification during iteration will always unset the <em>next</em> element, rather than the current one.</p>\n\n<h3>Examples: Your test cases</h3>\n\n<p>The three aspects described above should provide you with a mostly complete impression of the idiosyncracies of the foreach implementation and we can move on to discussing some examples. </p>\n\n<p>The behavior of your test cases is simple to explain at this point:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In test cases 1 and 2 <code>$array</code> starts off with refcount=1, so it will not be duplicated by foreach: Only the refcount is incremented. When the loop body subsequently modifies the array (which has refcount=2 at that point), the duplication will occur at that point. Foreach will continue working on an unmodified copy of <code>$array</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>In test case 3, once again the array is not duplicated, thus foreach will be modifying the IAP of the <code>$array</code> variable. At the end of the iteration the IAP is NULL (meaning iteration done), which <code>each</code> indicates by returning <code>false</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>In test cases 4 and 5 both <code>each</code> and <code>reset</code> are by-reference functions. The <code>$array</code> has a <code>refcount=2</code> when it is passed to them, so it has to be duplicated. As such <code>foreach</code> will be working on a separate array again.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Examples: Effects of <code>current</code> in foreach</h3>\n\n<p>A good way to show the various duplication behaviors is to observe the behavior of the  <code>current()</code> function inside a foreach loop. Consider this example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as $val) {\n    var_dump(current($array));\n}\n/* Output: 2 2 2 2 2 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here you should know that <code>current()</code> is a by-ref function (actually: prefer-ref), even though it does not modify the array. It has to be in order to play nice with all the other functions like <code>next</code> which are all by-ref. By-reference passing implies that the array has to be separated and thus <code>$array</code> and the foreach-array will be different. The reason you get <code>2</code> instead of <code>1</code> is also mentioned above: <code>foreach</code> advances the array pointer <em>before</em> running the user code, not after. So even though the code is at the first element, foreach already advanced the pointer to the second.</p>\n\n<p>Now lets try a small modification:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ref = &amp;$array;\nforeach ($array as $val) {\n    var_dump(current($array));\n}\n/* Output: 2 3 4 5 false */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we have the is_ref=1 case, so the array is not copied (just like above). But now that it is a reference, the array no longer has to be duplicated when passing to the by-ref <code>current()</code> function. Thus <code>current()</code> and foreach work on the same array. You still see the off-by-one behavior though, due to the way <code>foreach</code> advances the pointer.</p>\n\n<p>You get the same behavior when doing by-ref iteration:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as &amp;$val) {\n    var_dump(current($array));\n}\n/* Output: 2 3 4 5 false */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here the important part is that foreach will make <code>$array</code> an is_ref=1 when it is iterated by reference, so basically you have the same situation as above.</p>\n\n<p>Another small variation, this time we'll assign the array to another variable:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$foo = $array;\nforeach ($array as $val) {\n    var_dump(current($array));\n}\n/* Output: 1 1 1 1 1 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here the refcount of the <code>$array</code> is 2 when the loop is started, so for once we actually have to do the duplication upfront. Thus <code>$array</code> and the array used by foreach will be completely separate from the outset. That's why you get the position of the IAP wherever it was before the loop (in this case it was at the first position).</p>\n\n<h3>Examples: Modification during iteration</h3>\n\n<p>Trying to account for modifications during iteration is where all our foreach troubles originated, so it serves to consider some examples for this case.</p>\n\n<p>Consider these nested loops over the same array (where by-ref iteration is used to make sure it really is the same one):</p>\n\n<pre><code>foreach ($array as &amp;$v1) {\n    foreach ($array as &amp;$v2) {\n        if ($v1 == 1 &amp;&amp; $v2 == 1) {\n            unset($array[1]);\n        }\n        echo \"($v1, $v2)\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Output: (1, 1) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The expected part here is that <code>(1, 2)</code> is missing from the output, because element <code>1</code> was removed. What's probably unexpected is that the outer loop stops after the first element. Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>The reason behind this is the nested-loop hack described above: Before the loop body runs, the current IAP position and hash is backed up into a <code>HashPointer</code>. After the loop body it will be restored, but only if the element still exists, otherwise the current IAP position (whatever it may be) is used instead. In the example above this is exactly the case: The current element of the outer loop has been remove, so it will use the IAP, which has already been marked as finished by the inner loop!</p>\n\n<p>Another consequence of the <code>HashPointer</code> backup+restore mechanism is that changes to the IAP though <code>reset()</code> etc. usually do not impact foreach. For example, the following code executes as if the <code>reset()</code> were not present at all:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nforeach ($array as &amp;$value) {\n    var_dump($value);\n    reset($array);\n}\n// output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The reason is that, while <code>reset()</code> temporarily modifies the IAP, it will be restored to the current foreach element after the loop body. To force <code>reset()</code> to make an effect on the loop, you have to additionally remove the current element, so that the backup/restore mechanism fails:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n$ref =&amp; $array;\nforeach ($array as $value) {\n    var_dump($value);\n    unset($array[1]);\n    reset($array);\n}\n// output: 1, 1, 3, 4, 5\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But, those examples are still sane. The real fun starts if you remember that the <code>HashPointer</code> restore uses a pointer to the element and its hash to determine whether it still exists. But: Hashes have collisions, and pointers can be reused! This means that, with a careful choice of array keys, we can make <code>foreach</code> believe that an element that has been removed still exists, so it will jump directly to it. An example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = ['EzEz' =&gt; 1, 'EzFY' =&gt; 2, 'FYEz' =&gt; 3];\n$ref =&amp; $array;\nforeach ($array as $value) {\n    unset($array['EzFY']);\n    $array['FYFY'] = 4;\n    reset($array);\n    var_dump($value);\n}\n// output: 1, 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we should normally expect the output <code>1, 1, 3, 4</code> according to the previous rules. How what happens is that <code>'FYFY'</code> has the same hash as the removed element <code>'EzFY'</code>, and the allocator happens to reuse the same memory location to store the element. So foreach ends up directly jumping to the newly inserted element, thus short-cutting the loop.</p>\n\n<h3>Substituting the iterated entity during the loop</h3>\n\n<p>One last odd case that I'd like to mention, is is that PHP allows you to substitute the iterated entity during the loop. So you can start iterating on one array and then replace it with another array halfway through. Or start iterating on an array and then replace it with an object:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n$obj = (object) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];\n\n$ref =&amp; $arr;\nforeach ($ref as $val) {\n    echo \"$val\\n\";\n    if ($val == 3) {\n        $ref = $obj;\n    }\n}\n/* Output: 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see in this case PHP will just start iterating the other entity from the start once the substitution has happened.</p>\n\n<h2>PHP 7</h2>\n\n<h3>Hashtable iterators</h3>\n\n<p>If you still remember, the main problem with array iteration was how to handle removal of elements mid-iteration. PHP 5 used a single internal array pointer (IAP) for this purpose, which was somewhat suboptimal, as one array pointer had to be stretched to support multiple simultaneous foreach loops <em>and</em> interaction with <code>reset()</code> etc. on top of that.</p>\n\n<p>PHP 7 uses a different approach, namely it supports creating an arbitrary amount of external, safe hashtable iterators. These iterators have to be registered in the array, from which point on they have the same semantics as the IAP: If an array element is removed, all hashtable iterators pointing to that element will be advanced to the next element.</p>\n\n<p>This means that foreach will no longer use the IAP <strong>at all</strong>. The foreach loop will be absolutely no effect on the results of <code>current()</code> etc. and its own behavior will never be influence by functions like  <code>reset()</code> etc.</p>\n\n<h3>Array duplication</h3>\n\n<p>Another important change between PHP 5 and PHP 7 relates to array duplication. Now that the IAP is no longer used, by-value array iteration will only do a refcount increment (instead of duplication the array) in all cases. If the array is modified during the foreach loop, at that point a duplication will occur (according to copy-on-write) and foreach will keep working on the old array.</p>\n\n<p>In most cases this change is transparent and has no other effect than better performance. However there is one occasion where it results in different behavior, namely the case where the array was a reference beforehand:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n$ref = &amp;$array;\nforeach ($array as $val) {\n    var_dump($val);\n    $array[2] = 0;\n}\n/* Old output: 1, 2, 0, 4, 5 */\n/* New output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Previously by-value iteration of reference-arrays was special cases. In this case no duplication occurred, so all modifications of the array during iteration would be reflected by the loop. In PHP 7 this special case is gone: A by-value iteration of an array will <strong>always</strong> keep working on the original elements, disregarding any modifications during the loop.</p>\n\n<p>This, of course, does not apply to by-reference iteration. If you iterate by-reference all modifications will be reflected by the loop. Interestingly, the same is true for by-value iteration of plain objects:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$obj = new stdClass;\n$obj-&gt;foo = 1;\n$obj-&gt;bar = 2;\nforeach ($obj as $val) {\n    var_dump($val);\n    $obj-&gt;bar = 42;\n}\n/* Old and new output: 1, 42 */\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This reflects by-handle semantics of objects (i.e. they behave reference-like even in by-value contexts).</p>\n\n<h3>Examples</h3>\n\n<p>Lets consider a few examples, starting with your test cases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Test cases 1 and 2 retain the same output: By-value array iteration always keeps working on the original elements. (In this case even refcounting and duplication behavior is exactly the same between PHP 5 and PHP 7).</p></li>\n<li><p>Test case 3 changes: Foreach no longer uses the IAP, so <code>each()</code> is not affected by the loop. It will have the same output before and after.</p></li>\n<li><p>Test cases 4 and 5 stay the same: <code>each()</code> and <code>reset()</code> will duplicate the array before changing the IAP, while foreach still uses the original array. (Not that the IAP change would have mattered, even if the array was shared.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The second set of examples was related to the behavior of <code>current()</code> under different reference/refcounting configurations. This no longer makes sense, as <code>current()</code> is completely unaffected by the loop, so its return value always stays the same.</p>\n\n<p>However, we get some interesting changes when considering modifications during iteration. I hope you will find the new behavior more sane. The first example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nforeach ($array as &amp;$v1) {\n    foreach ($array as &amp;$v2) {\n        if ($v1 == 1 &amp;&amp; $v2 == 1) {\n            unset($array[1]);\n        }\n        echo \"($v1, $v2)\\n\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Old output: (1, 1) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5)\n// New output: (1, 1) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5)\n//             (3, 1) (3, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5)\n//             (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 4) (4, 5)\n//             (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 5) \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see, the outer loop no longer aborts after the first iteration. The reason is that both loops now have entirely separate hashtable iterators, and there is no longer any cross-contamination of both loops through a shared IAP.</p>\n\n<p>Another weird edge case that is fixed now, is the odd effect you get when you remove and add elements that happen to have the same hash:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$array = ['EzEz' =&gt; 1, 'EzFY' =&gt; 2, 'FYEz' =&gt; 3];\nforeach ($array as &amp;$value) {\n    unset($array['EzFY']);\n    $array['FYFY'] = 4;\n    var_dump($value);\n}\n// Old output: 1, 4\n// New output: 1, 3, 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Previously the HashPointer restore mechanism jumped right to the new element, because it \"looked\" like it's the same as the remove element (due to colliding hash and pointer). As we no longer rely on the element hash for anything, this is no longer an issue.</p>\n", "title": "How does &#39;foreach&#39; actually work?", "tags": ["php", "loops", "foreach", "iteration", "php-internals"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057671/how-does-foreach-actually-work/14854568#14854568", "question_id": 10057671, "answer_id": 14854568}, {"body": "<p><strong>Explanation (quote from <a href=\"http://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">php.net</a>):</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first form loops over the array given by array_expression.

They were adapted from a real-life example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>interface IIndexed { int this[int index] { get; set; } }\nstruct StructArray : IIndexed { \n    public int[] Array;\n    public int this[int index] {\n        get { return Array[index]; }\n        set { Array[index] = value; }\n    }\n}\n\nstatic int Generic&lt;T&gt;(int length, T a, T b) where T : IIndexed {\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)\n        sum += a[i] * b[i];\n    return sum;\n}\nstatic int Specialized(int length, StructArray a, StructArray b) {\n    int sum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; length; i++)\n        sum += a[i] * b[i];\n    return sum;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>One is a generic version of the other. Replacing the generic type with <code>StructArray</code> would make the methods identical. Because <code>StructArray</code> is a value type, it gets its own compiled version of the generic method. Yet the actual running time is significantly longer than the specialized method's, but only for x86. For x64, the timings are pretty much identical. In other cases, I've observed differences for x64 as well.</p>\n", "title": "Try-catch speeding up my code?", "tags": ["c#", ".net", "clr", "try-catch", "performance-testing"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8928403/try-catch-speeding-up-my-code/8931311#8931311", "question_id": 8928403, "answer_id": 8931311}, {"body": "<p>I'd have put this in as a comment as I'm really not certain that this is likely to be the case, but as I recall it doesn't a try/except statement involve a modification to the way the garbage disposal mechanism of the compiler works, in that it clears up object memory allocations in a recursive way off the stack.

On an x86 core, the jitter has the ebx, edx, esi and edi register available for general purpose storage of local variables.  The ecx register becomes available in a static method, it doesn't have to store <em>this</em>.  The eax register often is needed for calculations.  But these are 32-bit registers, for variables of type long it must use a pair of registers.  Which are edx:eax for calculations and edi:ebx for storage.</p>\n\n<p>Which is what stands out in the disassembly for the slow version, neither edi nor ebx are used.</p>\n\n<p>When the jitter can't find enough registers to store local variables then it must generate code to load and store them from the stack frame.  That slows down code, it prevents a processor optimization named \"register renaming\", an internal processor core optimization trick that uses multiple copies of a register and allows super-scalar execution.  Which permits several instructions to run concurrently, even when they use the same register.  Not having enough registers is a common problem on x86 cores, addressed in x64 which has 8 extra registers (r9 through r15).</p>\n\n<p>The jitter will do its best to apply another code generation optimization, it will try to inline your Fibo() method.  In other words, not make a call to the method but generate the code for the method inline in the Main() method.  Pretty important optimization that, for one, makes properties of a C# class for free, giving them the perf of a field.  It avoids the overhead of making the method call and setting up its stack frame, saves a couple of nanoseconds.</p>\n\n<p>There are several rules that determine exactly when a method can be inlined.  They are not exactly documented but have been mentioned in blog posts.  One rule is that it won't happen when the method body is too large.  That defeats the gain from inlining, it generates too much code that doesn't fit as well in the L1 instruction cache.  Another hard rule that applies here is that a method won't be inlined when it contains a try/catch statement.  The background behind that one is an implementation detail of exceptions, they piggy-back onto Windows' built-in support for SEH (Structure Exception Handling) which is stack-frame based.</p>\n\n<p>One behavior of the register allocation algorithm in the jitter can be inferred from playing with this code.  It appears to be aware of when the jitter is trying to inline a method.  One rule it appears to use that only the edx:eax register pair can be used for inlined code that has local variables of type long.  But not edi:ebx.  No doubt because that would be too detrimental to the code generation for the calling method, both edi and ebx are important storage registers.</p>\n\n<p>So you get the fast version because the jitter knows up front that the method body contains try/catch statements.  It knows it can never be inlined so readily uses edi:ebx for storage for the long variable.  You got the slow version because the jitter didn't know up front that inlining wouldn't work.  It only found out <em>after</em> generating the code for the method body.</p>\n\n<p>The flaw then is that it didn't go back and <em>re-generate</em> the code for the method.  Which is understandable, given the time constraints it has to operate in.</p>\n\n<p>This slow-down doesn't occur on x64 because for one it has 8 more registers.  For another because it can store a long in just one register (like rax).  And the slow-down doesn't occur when you use int instead of long because the jitter has a lot more flexibility in picking registers.</p>\n", "title": "Try-catch speeding up my code?", "tags": ["c#", ".net", "clr", "try-catch", "performance-testing"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8928403/try-catch-speeding-up-my-code/11794106#11794106", "question_id": 8928403, "answer_id": 11794106}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8928403/try-catch-speeding-up-my-code", "question_id": 8928403}, {"body": "<p>One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing\">image processing</a>.

Here are some details about my implementation:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=\"http://opencv.org\">OpenCV</a> library.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV\">HSV</a> and filtering based on \"red\" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/ktdAB.png\" alt=\"Binarized image\">  </li>\n<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>\n<li>Using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector\">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.\n<img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/F9319.png\" alt=\"Contour detection\"></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0123725380\">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform\">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>\n<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>\n<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will \"learn\".</li>\n<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wxrT1.png\" alt=\"GHT\"></p>\n\n<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>\n\n<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>\n<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>\n<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>\n<li>In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Can you help me improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively OpenCV</strong> features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentioned?</p>\n\n<p>I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)</p>\n", "title": "Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for &#39;Coca-Cola Can&#39; Recognition", "tags": ["c++", "algorithm", "image-processing", "opencv"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>If you are not limited to just a camera which wasn't in one of your constraints perhaps you can move to using a range sensor like the Xbox <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kinect</a>.

This is significant because this logo is very distinctive, and it should have a characteristic, scale-invariant signature in the frequency domain, particularly in the red channel of RGB. That is to say, the alternating pattern of red-to-white-to-red encountered by a horizontal scan line (trained on a horizontally aligned logo) will have a distinctive \"rhythm\" as it passes through the central axis of the logo. That rhythm will \"speed up\" or \"slow down\" at different scales and orientations, but will remain proportionally equivalent.

I was in the midst of throwing my thoughts into a comment on those, but I believe my approach is too answer-shaped to not leave here.</p>\n\n<p>In short summary, you've identified an algorithm to determine that a Coca-Cola logo is present at a particular location in space. You're now trying to determine, for arbitrary orientations and arbitrary scaling factors, a heuristic suitable for distinguishing Coca-Cola <em>cans</em> from other objects, inclusive of: <em>bottles</em>, <em>billboards</em>, <em>advertisements</em>, and <em>Coca-Cola paraphernalia</em> all associated with this iconic logo. You didn't call out many of these additional cases in your problem statement, but I feel they're vital to the success of your algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>The secret here is determining what visual features a <em>can</em> contains or, through the negative space, what features are present for other Coke products that are not present for cans. To that end, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/10168923/517815\">the current top answer</a> sketches out a basic approach for selecting \"can\" if and only if \"bottle\" is not identified, either by the presence of a bottle cap, liquid, or other similar visual heuristics.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is this breaks down. A bottle could, for example, be empty and lack the presence of a cap, leading to a false positive. Or, it could be <em>a partial bottle</em> with additional features mangled, leading again to false detection. Needless to say, this isn't elegant, nor is it effective for our purposes.</p>\n\n<p>To this end, the most correct selection criteria for cans appear to be the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is the shape of the object silhouette, as <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/10168686/517815\">you sketched out in your question</a>, correct? If so, +1.</li>\n<li>If we assume the presence of natural or artificial light, do we detect a chrome outline to the bottle that signifies whether this is made of aluminum? If so, +1.</li>\n<li>Do we determine that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection\">specular properties</a> of the object are correct, relative to our light sources (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQhtzQ-UVbc\">illustrative video link</a> on <a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/34/28314/01265865.pdf?arnumber=1265865\">light source detection</a>)? If so, +1.</li>\n<li>Can we determine any other properties about the object that identify it as a can, including, but not limited to, the topological image skew of the logo, the orientation of the object, the juxtaposition of the object (for example, on a planar surface like a table or in the context of other cans), and the presence of a pull tab? If so, for each, +1.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Your classification might then look like the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>For each candidate match, if the presence of a Coca Cola logo was detected, draw a gray border.</li>\n<li>For each match over +2, draw a red border.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This visually highlights to the user what was detected, emphasizing weak positives that may, correctly, be detected as mangled cans.</p>\n\n<p>The detection of each property carries a very different time and space complexity, and for each approach, a quick pass through <a href=\"http://dsp.stackexchange.com\">http://dsp.stackexchange.com</a> is more than reasonable for determining the most correct and most efficient algorithm for your purposes. My intent here is, purely and simply, to emphasize that <em>detecting if something is a can by invalidating a small portion of the candidate detection space</em> isn't the most robust or effective solution to this problem, and ideally, you should take the appropriate actions accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>And hey, congrats on <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3846063\">the Hacker News posting!</a> On the whole, this is a pretty terrific question worthy of the publicity it received. :)</p>\n", "title": "Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for &#39;Coca-Cola Can&#39; Recognition", "tags": ["c++", "algorithm", "image-processing", "opencv"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10168686/image-processing-algorithm-improvement-for-coca-cola-can-recognition/10272868#10272868", "question_id": 10168686, "answer_id": 10272868}, {"body": "<p>There are a bunch of color descriptors used to recognise objects, the paper below compares a lot of them.

Then you only have to figure out the differences between what's <strong>around</strong> the logo. Additionally, we want to do as little extra as possible. I think this is actually this easy part...</p>\n\n<p>What <em>is</em> around the logo? For a can, we can see metal, which despite the effects of lighting, does not change whatsoever in its basic colour. As long as we know the angle of the label, we can tell what's directly above it, so we're looking at the difference between these:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tqB8d.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here, what's above and below the logo is completely dark, consistent in colour. Relatively easy in that respect.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/witbV.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></p>\n\n<p>Here, what's above and below is light, but still consistent in colour. It's all-silver, and all-silver metal actually seems pretty rare, as well as silver colours in general. Additionally, it's in a thin slither and close enough to the red that has already been identified so you could trace its shape for its entire length to calculate a percentage of what can be considered the metal ring of the can. Really, you only need a small fraction of that anywhere along the can to tell it is part of it, but you still need to find a balance that ensures it's not just an empty bottle with something metal behind it.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/u9w9i.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"133\"></p>\n\n<p>And finally, the tricky one. But not so tricky, once we're only going by what we can see directly above (and below) the red wrapper. Its transparent, which means it will show whatever is behind it. That's good, because things that are behind it aren't likely to be as consistent in colour as the silver circular metal of the can. There could be many different things behind it, which would tell us that it's an empty (or filled with clear liquid) bottle, or a consistent colour, which could either mean that it's filled with liquid or that the bottle is simply in front of a solid colour. We're working with what's closest to the top and bottom, and the chances of the right colours being in the right place are relatively slim. We know it's a bottle, because it hasn't got that key visual element of the can, which is relatively simplistic compared to what could be behind a bottle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(that last one was the best I could find of an empty large coca cola bottle - interestingly the cap AND ring are yellow, indicating that the redness of the cap probably shouldn't be relied upon)</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the rare circumstance that a similar shade of silver is behind the bottle, even after the abstraction of the plastic, or the bottle is somehow filled with the same shade of silver liquid, we can fall back on what we can roughly estimate as being the shape of the silver - which as I mentioned, is circular and follows the shape of the can. But even though I lack any certain knowledge in image processing, that sounds slow. Better yet, why not deduce this by for once checking around the <strong>sides</strong> of the logo to ensure there is nothing of the same silver colour there? Ah, but what if there's the same shade of silver behind a can? Then, we do indeed have to pay more attention to shapes, looking at the top and bottom of the can again. </p>\n\n<p>Depending on how flawless this all needs to be, it could be very slow, but I guess my basic concept is to check the easiest and closest things first. Go by colour differences around the already matched shape (which seems the most trivial part of this anyway) before going to the effort of working out the shape of the other elements. To list it, it goes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Find the main attraction (red logo background, and possibly the logo itself for orientation, though in case the can is turned away, you need to concentrate on the red alone)</li>\n<li>Verify the shape and orientation, yet again via the very distinctive redness</li>\n<li>Check colours around the shape (since it's quick and painless)</li>\n<li>Finally, if needed, verify the shape of those colours around the main attraction for the right roundness.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the event you can't do this, it probably means the top and bottom of the can are covered, and the only possible things that a human could have used to reliably make a distinction between the can and the bottle is the occlusion and reflection of the can, which would be a <strong>much</strong> harder battle to process. However, to go even further, you could follow the angle of the can/bottle to check for more bottle-like traits, using the semi-transparent scanning techniques mentioned in the other answers.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting additional nightmares might include a can conveniently sitting behind the bottle at such a distance that the metal of it just so happens to show above and below the label, which would still fail as long as you're scanning along the entire length of the red label - which is actually more of a problem because you're not detecting a can where you could have, as opposed to considering that you're actually detecting a bottle, including the can by accident. The glass is half empty, in that case!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As a disclaimer, I have no experience in nor have ever thought about image processing outside of this question, but it is so interesting that it got me thinking pretty deeply about it, and after reading all the other answers, I consider this to possibly be the easiest <strong>and</strong> most efficient way to get it done. Personally, I'm just glad I don't <em>actually</em> have to think about programming this!</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AglOz.png\" alt=\"bad drawing of a can in MS paint\">\nAdditionally, look at this drawing I did in MS Paint... It's absolutely awful and quite incomplete, but based on the shape and colours alone, you can guess what it's probably going to be. In essence, these are the only things that one needs to bother scanning for. When you look at that very distinctive shape and combination of colours so close, what else could it possibly be? The bit I didn't paint, the white background, should be considered \"anything inconsistent\". If it had a transparent background, it could go over almost any other image and you could still see it.</p>\n", "title": "Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for &#39;Coca-Cola Can&#39; Recognition", "tags": ["c++", "algorithm", "image-processing", "opencv"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10168686/image-processing-algorithm-improvement-for-coca-cola-can-recognition/24714828#24714828", "question_id": 10168686, "answer_id": 24714828}, {"body": "<p>As alternative to all these nice solutions, you can train your own classifier and make your application robust to errors.

If you actually install the 1.6 JRE, you can point to its installation (for example, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/jre/lib/rt.jar on Ubuntu, /usr/jdk/jdk1.6.0_60/jre/lib/rt.jar on SunOS apparently. Sorry, I don't know where it is on a Windows system). Like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>javac -source 1.6 -target 1.6 -bootclasspath /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-i386/jre/lib/rt.jar HelloWorld.java\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It looks like you can just download rt.jar from the Internet, and point to it.

Still, this macro can't be used as an initializer.  However, using by <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Statement-Exprs.html#Statement-Exprs\"><em>statement expressions</em></a> (another GCC C-extension), you can!</p>\n\n<pre><code>#define ANY_NUMBER_BUT_FIVE(number)                           \\\n    ({                                                        \\\n        typeof(number) n = (number);                          \\\n        extern void this_number_is_five(void) __attribute__(( \\\n                error(\"I told you not to give me a five!\"))); \\\n        if (n == 5)                                           \\\n            this_number_is_five();                            \\\n        n;                                                    \\\n    })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This macro will evaluate its parameter exactly once (in case it has side-effects) and create a compile-time error that says \"I told you not to give me a five!\" if the expression evaluates to five or is not a compile-time constant.</p>\n\n<p>So why aren't we using this instead of negative-sized bit-fields? Alas, there are currently many restrictions of the use of statement expressions, including their use as constant initializers (for enum constants, bit-field width, etc.) even if the statement expression is completely constant its self (i.e., can be fully evaluated at compile-time and otherwise passes the <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Other-Builtins.html#index-g_t_005f_005fbuiltin_005fconstant_005fp-3386\"><code>__builtin_constant_p()</code></a> test).  Further, they cannot be used outside of a function body.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully, GCC will amend these shortcomings soon and allow constant statement expressions to be used as constant initializers.  The challenge here is the language specification defining what is a legal constant expression.  C++11 added the constexpr keyword for just this type or thing, but no counterpart exists in C11.

I also learned that <a href=\"http://c-faq.com/stdio/scanfprobs.html\">scanf</a> and <a href=\"http://c-faq.com/stdio/getsvsfgets.html\">gets</a> are both UNSAFE and should NOT BE USED due to potential of buffer overflow.  So, I wrote this iteration using fgets, the safer alternative to gets.  Here are the pertinent lines for my fellow noobs:</p>\n\n<pre><code>char input_line[MAX_LINE];\nchar *result;\n\n//&lt;snip&gt;\n\nwhile((result = fgets(input_line, MAX_LINE, stdin )) != NULL)    \n    line_count++;\nif (ferror(stdin))\n    perror(\"Error reading stdin.\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, here are the results using an even larger file (100M lines; ~3.4GB) on a fast server with very fast disk, comparing the python, the unsynced cin, and the fgets approaches, as well as comparing with the wc utility.  [The scanf version segfaulted and I don't feel like troubleshooting it.]:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test.py \n0.03user 2.04system 0:28.06elapsed 7%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2464maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+182minor)pagefaults 0swaps\nRead 100000000 lines in 28 seconds.

I suspect that, at this point, other parts of the code will become the bottleneck, so I don't think optimizing to that level would even be worthwhile, even if possible (since, after all, I actually need to store the read lines in memory).  </p>\n\n<p>Also note that a small tradeoff with using a char * buffer and fgets vs unsynced cin to string is that the latter can read lines of any length, while the former requires limiting input to some finite number.  In practice, this is probably a non-issue for reading most line-based input files, as the buffer can be set to a very large value that would not be exceeded by valid input. </p>\n\n<p>This has been educational.  Thanks to all for your comments and suggestions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 6:</strong></p>\n\n<p>As suggested by J.F. Sebastian in the comments below, the GNU wc utility uses plain C read() (within the safe-read.c wrapper) to read chunks (of 16k bytes) at a time and count new lines.  Here's a python equivalent based on J.F.'s code (just showing the relevant snippet that replaces the python for loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>BUFFER_SIZE = 16384 \ncount = sum(chunk.count('\\n') for chunk in iter(partial(sys.stdin.read, BUFFER_SIZE), ''))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The performance of this version is quite fast (though still a bit slower than the raw c wc utility, of course:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ /usr/bin/time cat temp_big_file | readline_test3.py \n0.01user 1.16system 0:04.74elapsed 24%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 2448maxresident)k\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+181minor)pagefaults 0swaps\nRead 100000000 lines in 4.7275 seconds. LPS: 21152829\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, it's a bit silly for me to compare C++ fgets/cin and the first python code on the one hand to wc -l and this last python snippet on the other, as the latter two don't actually store the read lines but merely count newlines.  Still, it's interesting to explore all the different implementations and think about the performance implications.  Thanks again!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 7: Tiny benchmark addendum and recap</strong></p>\n\n<p>For completeness, I thought I'd update the read speed for the same file on the same box with the original (synced) C++ code.

IE: I don't even have to name the local branch, Git automatically copies the name of the remote branch for me. Thanks Git!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Also as <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/1783426/1020470\">the answer in this similar SO post</a> shows, if you don't name the local branch in <code>fetch</code>, you can still create it when you check it out by using the <code>-b</code> flag. <em>IE:</em> <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code> followed by <code>git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;</code> does exactly the same as my initial answer. And evidently if your repo has <em>only one</em> remote, then you can just do <code>git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</code> after <code>fetch</code> and it will create a local branch for you. <em>EG:</em> You just cloned a repo and want to check out additional branches from the remote.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that some of the documentation for <code>fetch</code> may have been copied verbatim from <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html\"><code>pull</code></a>. In particular the section on <code>&lt;refspec&gt;</code> in <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html#_options\">options</a> is the same. However, I do not believe that <code>fetch</code> will ever <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html\"><code>merge</code></a>, so that if you leave the destination side of the colon empty <code>fetch</code> <strong>should do nothing</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: That <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt; &lt;refspec&gt;</code> is short for <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt; &lt;refspec&gt;:</code> which would therefore do nothing, but <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt; &lt;tag&gt;</code> is the same as <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt; &lt;tag&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;</code> which should copy the remote <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> locally.</p>\n\n<p>I guess this is only helpful if you want to copy a remote branch locally, but not necessarily check it out right away. Otherwise I now would use <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/9537923/1020470\">the accepted answer above</a>, which is explained in detail in the first section of the <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html#_description\">checkout description</a> and later in the <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-checkout.html#_options\">options</a> section under the explanation of <code>--track</code>, since it's a 1-liner. <em>Well...</em> sort of a 1-liner, because you would <em>still</em> have to run <code>git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</code> first.</p>\n\n<p>FYI: The order of the <code>&lt;refspecs&gt;</code> (source:destination) explains the bizarre pre Git-1.7 method for <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches#Deleting-Remote-Branches\">deleting remote branches</a>.

You need to work out the selector to the hidden menu option and then set it to display as block when the appropriate <code>li</code> tag is hovered over. Taking the example from the twitter bootstrap page, the selector would be as follows:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>ul.nav li.dropdown:hover &gt; ul.dropdown-menu {\n    display: block;    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, if you are using Bootstrap's responsive features, you will not want this functionality on a collapsed navbar (on smaller screens). To avoid this, wrap the code above in a media query:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@media (min-width: 979px) {\n  ul.nav li.dropdown:hover &gt; ul.dropdown-menu {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To hide the arrow (caret) this is done in different ways depending on whether you are using Twitter Bootstrap version 2 and lower or version 3:</p>\n\n<p><b>Bootstrap 3</b></p>\n\n<p>To remove the caret in version 3 you just need to remove the HTML <code>&lt;b class=\"caret\"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</code> from the <code>.dropdown-toggle</code> anchor element:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;a class=\"dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\" href=\"#\"&gt;\n    Dropdown\n    &lt;b class=\"caret\"&gt;&lt;/b&gt;    &lt;-- remove this line\n&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><b>Bootstrap 2 &amp; lower</b></p>\n\n<p>To remove the caret in version 2 you need a little more insight into CSS and I suggest looking at how the <code>:after</code> pseudo element works in more detail. To get you started on your way to understanding, to target and remove the arrows in the twitter bootstrap example, you would use the following CSS selector and code:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>a.menu:after, .dropdown-toggle:after {\n    content: none;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It will work in your favour if you look further into how these work and not just use the answers that I have given you.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Thanks to @CocaAkat for pointing out that we were missing the \">\" child combinator to prevent sub menus being shown on the parent hover</em></strong></p>\n", "title": "How to make twitter bootstrap menu dropdown on hover rather than click", "tags": ["css", "drop-down-menu", "twitter-bootstrap"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8878033/how-to-make-twitter-bootstrap-menu-dropdown-on-hover-rather-than-click/8878666#8878666", "question_id": 8878033, "answer_id": 8878666}, {"body": "<p>In addition to the answer from \"My Head Hurts\" (which was great):</p>\n\n<pre><code>ul.nav li.dropdown:hover ul.dropdown-menu{\n    display: block;    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are 2 lingering issues:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Clicking on the dropdown link will open the dropdown-menu.

Then it just works. When you stop hovering on either the parent li with the dropdown class or the child ul/li's, it removes the open class. Obviously, this is only one of many solutions, and you can add to it to make it work on only specific instances of .dropdown. Or add a transition to either parent or child.</p>\n", "title": "How to make twitter bootstrap menu dropdown on hover rather than click", "tags": ["css", "drop-down-menu", "twitter-bootstrap"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8878033/how-to-make-twitter-bootstrap-menu-dropdown-on-hover-rather-than-click/21486327#21486327", "question_id": 8878033, "answer_id": 21486327}, {"body": "<p>Here's my technique that adds a slight delay before the menu is closed after you stop hovering on the menu or the toggle button.

This is very simple, just use this javascript/jquery code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$(document).ready(function () {\n    $('.dropdown-toggle').mouseover(function() {\n        $('.dropdown-menu').show();\n    })\n\n    $('.dropdown-toggle').mouseout(function() {\n        t = setTimeout(function() {\n            $('.dropdown-menu').hide();\n        }, 100);\n\n        $('.dropdown-menu').on('mouseenter', function() {\n            $('.dropdown-menu').show();\n            clearTimeout(t);\n        }).on('mouseleave', function() {\n            $('.dropdown-menu').hide();\n        })\n    })\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This works very well and here is the explanation: we have a button, and a menu. When we hover the button we display the menu, and when we mouseout of the button we hide the menu after 100ms. If you wonder why i use that, is because you need time to drag the cursor from the button over the menu. When you are on the menu, the time is reset and you can stay there as many time as you want. When you exit the menu, we will hide the menu instantly without any timeout.</p>\n\n<p>I've used this code in many projects, if you encounter any problem using it, feel free to ask me questions.</p>\n", "title": "How to make twitter bootstrap menu dropdown on hover rather than click", "tags": ["css", "drop-down-menu", "twitter-bootstrap"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8878033/how-to-make-twitter-bootstrap-menu-dropdown-on-hover-rather-than-click/22353173#22353173", "question_id": 8878033, "answer_id": 22353173}, {"body": "<p>Simply customize your CSS style in three lines of code</p>\n\n<pre><code>.dropdown:hover .dropdown-menu {\n   display: block;\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to make twitter bootstrap menu dropdown on hover rather than click", "tags": ["css", "drop-down-menu", "twitter-bootstrap"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8878033/how-to-make-twitter-bootstrap-menu-dropdown-on-hover-rather-than-click/22877385#22877385", "question_id": 8878033, "answer_id": 22877385}, {"body": "<p>Also added margin-top:0 to reset the bootstrap css margin for .dropdown-menu so the menu list dosen't dissapear when the user hovers slowly from drop down menu to the menu list.</p>\n\n<pre><code>ul.nav li.dropdown:hover &gt; ul.dropdown-menu {\n    display: block;    \n}\n\n.nav .dropdown-menu {\n    margin-top: 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How to make twitter bootstrap menu dropdown on hover rather than click", "tags": ["css", "drop-down-menu", "twitter-bootstrap"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8878033/how-to-make-twitter-bootstrap-menu-dropdown-on-hover-rather-than-click/23654267#23654267", "question_id": 8878033, "answer_id": 23654267}, {"body": "<p>We saw, <strong>In addition to the answer from</strong> \"<em>My Head Hurts</em>\", \"<em>Cory Price</em>\" found out 2 problems</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Clicking on the dropdown link will open the dropdown-menu.

These patterns were analyzed and extracted for the rest of us by the Gang of Four, when they published their book: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\">Design Patterns</a>.

They show us a complete set of patterns that we may choose from and implement in our different components that will together form the whole system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So what is Apache Camel?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Apache Camel offers you the interfaces for the EIPs, the base objects, commonly needed implementations, debugging tools, a configuration system, and many other helpers which will save you a ton of time when you want to implement your solution to follow the EIPs.</p>\n\n<p>Take MVC. MVC is pretty simple in theory and we could implement it without any framework help.

So there\nis a root node, edges going out of it leading to new nodes, and\nfurther edges going out of those, and so forth</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>But</strong>: Unlike in a search trie, the edge labels are not single\ncharacters. Instead, each edge is labeled using a pair of integers\n<code>[from,to]</code>. These are pointers into the text. In this sense, each\nedge carries a string label of arbitrary length, but takes only O(1)\nspace (two pointers).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Basic principle</h2>\n\n<p>I would like to first demonstrate how to create the suffix tree of a\nparticularly simple string, a string with no repeated characters:</p>\n\n<pre><code>abc\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The algorithm <strong>works in steps, from left to right</strong>. There is <strong>one step for every character of the string</strong>. Each step might involve more than one individual operation, but we will see (see the final observations at the end) that the total number of operations is O(n).</p>\n\n<p>So, we start from the <em>left</em>, and first insert only the single character\n<code>a</code> by creating an edge from the root node (on the left) to a leaf,\nand labeling it as <code>[0,#]</code>, which means the edge represents the\nsubstring starting at position 0 and ending at <em>the current end</em>. I\nuse the symbol <code>#</code> to mean <em>the current end</em>, which is at position 1\n(right after <code>a</code>).</p>\n\n<p>So we have an initial tree, which looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/aOwIL.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>And what it means is this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/SZH4k.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Now we progress to position 2 (right after <code>b</code>). <strong>Our goal at each step</strong>\nis to insert <strong>all suffixes up to the current position</strong>. We do this\nby</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>expanding the existing <code>a</code>-edge to <code>ab</code></li>\n<li>inserting one new edge for <code>b</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In our representation this looks like</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/onmqt.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>And what it means is:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/tchAx.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>We observe</strong> two things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The edge representation for <code>ab</code> is <strong>the same</strong> as it used to be\nin the initial tree: <code>[0,#]</code>. Its meaning has automatically changed\nbecause we updated the current position <code>#</code> from 1 to 2.</li>\n<li>Each edge consumes O(1) space, because it consists of only two\npointers into the text, regardless of how many characters it\nrepresents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Next we increment the position again and update the tree by appending\na <code>c</code> to every existing edge and inserting one new edge for the new\nsuffix <code>c</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In our representation this looks like</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wCEdI.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>And what it means is:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/UpUFw.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>We observe:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The tree is the correct suffix tree <em>up to the current position</em>\nafter each step</li>\n<li>There are as many steps as there are characters in the text</li>\n<li>The amount of work in each step is O(1), because all existing edges\nare updated automatically by incrementing <code>#</code>, and inserting the\none new edge for the final character can be done in O(1)\ntime. Hence for a string of length n, only O(n) time is required.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>First extension: Simple repetitions</h2>\n\n<p>Of course this works so nicely only because our string does not\ncontain any repetitions. We now look at a more realistic string:</p>\n\n<pre><code>abcabxabcd\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It starts with <code>abc</code> as in the previous example, then <code>ab</code> is repeated\nand followed by <code>x</code>, and then <code>abc</code> is repeated followed by <code>d</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Steps 1 through 3:</strong> After the first 3 steps we have the tree from the previous example:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/AclCh.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> We move <code>#</code> to position 4. This implicitly updates all existing\nedges to this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xhVMY.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>and we need to insert the final suffix of the current step, <code>a</code>, at\nthe root.</p>\n\n<p>Before we do this, we introduce <strong>two more variables</strong> (in addition to\n<code>#</code>), which of course have been there all the time but we haven't used\nthem so far:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>active point</strong>, which is a triple\n<code>(active_node,active_edge,active_length)</code></li>\n<li>The <code>remainder</code>, which is an integer indicating how many new suffixes\nwe need to insert</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The exact meaning of these two will become clear soon, but for now\nlet's just say:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the simple <code>abc</code> example, the active point was always\n<code>(root,'\\0x',0)</code>, i.e. <code>active_node</code> was the root node, <code>active_edge</code> was specified as the null character <code>'\\0x'</code>, and <code>active_length</code> was zero. The effect of this was that the one new edge that\nwe inserted in every step was inserted at the root node as a\nfreshly created edge. We will see soon why a triple is necessary to\nrepresent this information.</li>\n<li>The <code>remainder</code> was always set to 1 at the beginning of each\nstep. The meaning of this was that the number of suffixes we had to\nactively insert at the end of each step was 1 (always just the\nfinal character).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now this is going to change. When we insert the current final\ncharacter <code>a</code> at the root, we notice that there is already an outgoing\nedge starting with <code>a</code>, specifically: <code>abca</code>. Here is what we do in\nsuch a case:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We <strong>do not</strong> insert a fresh edge <code>[4,#]</code> at the root node. Instead we\nsimply notice that the suffix <code>a</code> is already in our\ntree. It ends in the middle of a longer edge, but we are not\nbothered by that. We just leave things the way they are.</li>\n<li>We <strong>set the active point</strong> to <code>(root,'a',1)</code>. That means the active\npoint is now somewhere in the middle of outgoing edge of the root node that starts with <code>a</code>, specifically, after position 1 on that edge. We\nnotice that the edge is specified simply by its first\ncharacter <code>a</code>. That suffices because there can be <em>only one</em> edge\nstarting with any particular character (confirm that this is true after reading through the entire description).</li>\n<li>We also increment <code>remainder</code>, so at the beginning of the next step\nit will be 2.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Observation:</strong> When the final <strong>suffix we need to insert is found to\nexist in the tree already</strong>, the tree itself is <strong>not changed</strong> at all (we only update the active point and <code>remainder</code>). The tree\nis then not an accurate representation of the suffix tree <em>up to the\ncurrent position</em> any more, but it <strong>contains</strong> all suffixes (because the final\nsuffix <code>a</code> is contained <em>implicitly</em>). Hence, apart from updating the\nvariables (which are all of fixed length, so this is O(1)), there was\n<strong>no work</strong> done in this step.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> We update the current position <code>#</code> to 5. This\nautomatically updates the tree to this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XL6bg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>And <strong>because <code>remainder</code> is 2</strong>, we need to insert two final\nsuffixes of the current position: <code>ab</code> and <code>b</code>. This is basically because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>a</code> suffix from the previous step has never been properly\ninserted. So it has <em>remained</em>, and since we have progressed one\nstep, it has now grown from <code>a</code> to <code>ab</code>.</li>\n<li>And we need to insert the new final edge <code>b</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In practice this means that we go to the active point (which points to\nbehind the <code>a</code> on what is now the <code>abcab</code> edge), and insert the\ncurrent final character <code>b</code>. <strong>But:</strong> Again, it turns out that <code>b</code> is\nalso already present on that same edge.</p>\n\n<p>So, again, we do not change the tree. We simply:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Update the active point to <code>(root,'a',2)</code> (same node and edge\nas before, but now we point to behind the <code>b</code>)</li>\n<li>Increment the <code>remainder</code> to 3 because we still have not properly\ninserted the final edge from the previous step, and we don't insert\nthe current final edge either.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To be clear: We had to insert <code>ab</code> and <code>b</code> in the current step, but\nbecause <code>ab</code> was already found, we updated the active point and did\nnot even attempt to insert <code>b</code>. Why? Because if <code>ab</code> is in the tree,\n<strong>every suffix</strong> of it (including <code>b</code>) must be in the tree,\ntoo. Perhaps only <em>implicitly</em>, but it must be there, because of the\nway we have built the tree so far.</p>\n\n<p>We proceed to <strong>step 6</strong> by incrementing <code>#</code>. The tree is\nautomatically updated to:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/bLLT9.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Because <strong><code>remainder</code> is 3</strong>, we have to insert <code>abx</code>, <code>bx</code> and\n<code>x</code>. The active point tells us where <code>ab</code> ends, so we only need to\njump there and insert the <code>x</code>. Indeed, <code>x</code> is not there yet, so we\nsplit the <code>abcabx</code> edge and insert an internal node:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/6HYtR.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The edge representations are still pointers into the text, so\nsplitting and inserting an internal node can be done in O(1) time.</p>\n\n<p>So we have dealt with <code>abx</code> and decrement <code>remainder</code> to 2. Now we\nneed to insert the next remaining suffix, <code>bx</code>. But before we do that\nwe need to update the active point. The rule for this, after splitting\nand inserting an edge, will be called <strong>Rule 1</strong> below, and it applies whenever the\n<code>active_node</code> is root (we will learn rule 3 for other cases further\nbelow). Here is rule 1:</p>\n\n<p>After an insertion from root,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>active_node</code> remains root</li>\n<li><code>active_edge</code> is set to the first character of the new suffix we\nneed to insert, i.e. <code>b</code></li>\n<li><code>active_length</code> is reduced by 1</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hence, the new active-point triple <code>(root,'b',1)</code> indicates that the\nnext insert has to be made at the <code>bcabx</code> edge, behind 1 character,\ni.e. behind <code>b</code>. We can identify the insertion point in O(1) time and\ncheck whether <code>x</code> is already present or not. If it was present, we\nwould end the current step and leave everything the way it is. But <code>x</code>\nis not present, so we insert it by splitting the edge:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/YVvbJ.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Again, this took O(1) time and we update <code>remainder</code> to 1 and the\nactive point to <code>(root,'x',0)</code> as rule 1 states.</p>\n\n<p>But there is one more thing we need to do. We'll call this <strong>Rule 2:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If we split an edge and insert a new node, and if that is <em>not the\n  first node</em> created during the current step, we connect the previously\n  inserted node and the new node through a special pointer, a <strong>suffix\n  link</strong>. We will later see why that is useful. Here is what we get, the\n  suffix link is represented as a dotted edge:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zL9yl.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>We still need to insert the final suffix of the current step,\n<code>x</code>. Since the <code>active_length</code> component of the active node has fallen\nto 0, the final insert is made at the root directly. Since there is no\noutgoing edge at the root node starting with <code>x</code>, we insert a new\nedge:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/992gV.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>As we can see, in the current step all remaining inserts were made.</p>\n\n<p>We proceed to <strong>step 7</strong> by setting <code>#</code>=7, which automatically appends the next character,\n<code>a</code>, to all leaf edges, as always. Then we attempt to insert the new final\ncharacter to the active point (the root), and find that it is there\nalready. So we end the current step without inserting anything and\nupdate the active point to <code>(root,'a',1)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In <strong>step 8</strong>,, <code>#</code>=8, we append <code>b</code>, and as seen before, this only\nmeans we update the active point to <code>(root,'a',2)</code> and increment <code>remainder</code> without doing\nanything else, because <code>b</code> is already present. <strong>However,</strong> we notice (in O(1) time) that the active point\nis now at the end of an edge. We reflect this by re-setting it to\n<code>(node1,'\\0x',0)</code>. Here, I use <code>node1</code> to refer to the\ninternal node the <code>ab</code> edge ends at.</p>\n\n<p>Then, in <strong>step <code>#</code>=9</strong>, we need to insert 'c' and this will help us to\nunderstand the final trick:</p>\n\n<h2>Second extension: Using suffix links</h2>\n\n<p>As always, the <code>#</code> update appends <code>c</code> automatically to the leaf edges\nand we go to the active point to see if we can insert 'c'. It turns\nout 'c' exists already at that edge, so we set the active point to\n<code>(node1,'c',1)</code>, increment <code>remainder</code> and do nothing else.</p>\n\n<p>Now in <strong>step <code>#</code>=10</strong>, <code>remainder is 4</code>, and so we first need to insert\n<code>abcd</code> (which remains from 3 steps ago) by inserting <code>d</code> at the active\npoint.</p>\n\n<p>Attempting to insert <code>d</code> at the active point causes an edge split in\nO(1) time:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Rkdzd.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>The <code>active_node</code>, from which the split was initiated, is marked in\nred above. Here is the final rule, <strong>Rule 3:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After splitting an edge from an <code>active_node</code> that is not the root\n  node, we follow the suffix link going out of that node, if there is\n  any, and reset the <code>active_node</code> to the node it points to. If there is\n  no suffix link, we set the <code>active_node</code> to the root. <code>active_edge</code>\n  and <code>active_length</code> remain unchanged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the active point is now <code>(node2,'c',1)</code>, and <code>node2</code> is marked in\nred below:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0IS5C.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>Since the insertion of <code>abcd</code> is complete, we decrement <code>remainder</code> to\n3 and consider the next remaining suffix of the current step,\n<code>bcd</code>. Rule 3 has set the active point to just the right node and edge\nso inserting <code>bcd</code> can be done by simply inserting its final character\n<code>d</code> at the active point.</p>\n\n<p>Doing this causes another edge split, and <strong>because of rule 2</strong>, we\nmust create a suffix link from the previously inserted node to the new\none:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNVQO.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>We observe:</strong> Suffix links enable us to reset the active point so we\n  can make the next <em>remaining insert</em> at O(1) effort. Look at the\n  graph above to confirm that indeed node at label <code>ab</code> is linked to\n  the node at <code>b</code> (its suffix), and the node at <code>abc</code> is linked to\n  <code>bc</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The current step is not finished yet. <code>remainder</code> is now 2, and we\nneed to follow rule 3 to reset the active point again. Since the\ncurrent <code>active_node</code> (red above) has no suffix link, we reset to\nroot. The active point is now <code>(root,'c',1)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Hence the next insert occurs at the one outgoing edge of the root node\nwhose label starts with <code>c</code>: <code>cabxabcd</code>, behind the first character,\ni.e. behind <code>c</code>. This causes another split:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/wZ7Bj.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>And since this involves the creation of a new internal node,we follow\nrule 2 and set a new suffix link from the previously created internal\nnode:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/urgol.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>(I am using <a href=\"http://www.graphviz.org/\">Graphviz Dot</a> for these little\ngraphs. The new suffix link caused dot to re-arrange the existing\nedges, so check carefully to confirm that the only thing that was\ninserted above is a new suffix link.)</p>\n\n<p>With this, <code>remainder</code> can be set to 1 and since the <code>active_node</code> is\nroot, we use rule 1 to update the active point to <code>(root,'d',0)</code>. This\nmeans the final insert of the current step is to insert a single <code>d</code>\nat root:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/TPxLe.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>That was the final step and we are done. There are number of <strong>final\nobservations</strong>, though:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In each step we move <code>#</code> forward by 1 position. This automatically\nupdates all leaf nodes in O(1) time.</p></li>\n<li><p>But it does not deal with a) any suffixes <em>remaining</em> from previous\nsteps, and b) with the one final character of the current step.</p></li>\n<li><p><code>remainder</code> tells us how many additional inserts we need to\nmake. These inserts correspond one-to-one to the final suffixes of\nthe string that ends at the current position <code>#</code>. We consider one\nafter the other and make the insert. <strong>Important:</strong> Each insert is\ndone in O(1) time since the active point tells us exactly where to\ngo, and we need to add only one single character at the active\npoint. Why? Because the other characters are <em>contained implicitly</em>\n(otherwise the active point would not be where it is).</p></li>\n<li><p>After each such insert, we decrement <code>remainder</code> and follow the\nsuffix link if there is any. If not we go to root (rule 3). If we\nare at root already, we modify the active point using rule 1. In\nany case, it takes only O(1) time.</p></li>\n<li><p>If, during one of these inserts, we find that the character we want\nto insert is already there, we don't do anything and end the\ncurrent step, even if <code>remainder</code>>0. The reason is that any\ninserts that remain will be suffixes of the one we just tried to\nmake. Hence they are all <em>implicit</em> in the current tree. The fact\nthat <code>remainder</code>>0 makes sure we deal with the remaining suffixes\nlater.</p></li>\n<li><p>What if at the end of the algorithm <code>remainder</code>>0? This will be the\ncase whenever the end of the text is a substring that occurred\nsomewhere before. In that case we must append one extra character\nat the end of the string that has not occurred before. In the\nliterature, usually the dollar sign <code>$</code> is used as a symbol for\nthat. <strong>Why does that matter?</strong> --> If later we use the completed suffix tree to search for suffixes, we must accept matches only if they <em>end at a leaf</em>. Otherwise we would get a lot of spurious matches, because there are <em>many</em> strings <em>implicitly</em> contained in the tree that are not actual suffixes of the main string. Forcing <code>remainder</code> to be 0 at the end is essentially a way to ensure that all suffixes end at a leaf node. <strong>However,</strong> if we want to use the tree to search for <em>general substrings</em>, not only <em>suffixes</em> of the main string, this final step is indeed not required, as suggested by the OP's comment below.</p></li>\n<li><p>So what is the complexity of the entire algorithm? If the text is n\ncharacters in length, there are obviously n steps (or n+1 if we add\nthe dollar sign). In each step we either do nothing (other than\nupdating the variables), or we make <code>remainder</code> inserts, each taking O(1)\ntime. Since <code>remainder</code> indicates how many times we have done nothing\nin previous steps, and is decremented for every insert that we make\nnow, the total number of times we do something is exactly n (or\nn+1). Hence, the total complexity is O(n).</p></li>\n<li><p>However, there is one small thing that I did not properly explain:\nIt can happen that we follow a suffix link, update the active\npoint, and then find that its <code>active_length</code> component does not\nwork well with the new <code>active_node</code>. For example, consider a situation\nlike this:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/7t0dg.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>(The dashed lines indicate the rest of the tree. The dotted line is a\nsuffix link.)</p>\n\n<p>Now let the active point be <code>(red,'d',3)</code>, so it points to the place\nbehind the <code>f</code> on the <code>defg</code> edge. Now assume we made the necessary\nupdates and now follow the suffix link to update the active point\naccording to rule 3. The new active point is <code>(green,'d',3)</code>. However,\nthe <code>d</code>-edge going out of the green node is <code>de</code>, so it has only 2\ncharacters. In order to find the correct active point, we obviously\nneed to follow that edge to the blue node and reset to <code>(blue,'f',1)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In a particularly bad case, the <code>active_length</code> could be as large as\n<code>remainder</code>, which can be as large as n. And it might very well happen\nthat to find the correct active point, we need not only jump over one\ninternal node, but perhaps many, up to n in the worst case. Does that\nmean the algorithm has a hidden O(n<sup>2</sup>) complexity, because\nin each step <code>remainder</code> is generally O(n), and the post-adjustments\nto the active node after following a suffix link could be O(n), too?</p>\n\n<p>No. The reason is that if indeed we have to adjust the active point\n(e.g. from green to blue as above), that brings us to a new node that\nhas its own suffix link, and <code>active_length</code> will be reduced. As\nwe follow down the chain of suffix links we make the remaining inserts, <code>active_length</code> can only\ndecrease, and the number of active-point adjustments we can make on\nthe way can't be larger than <code>active_length</code> at any given time. Since\n<code>active_length</code> can never be larger than <code>remainder</code>, and <code>remainder</code>\nis O(n) not only in every single step, but the total sum of increments\never made to <code>remainder</code> over the course of the entire process is\nO(n) too, the number of active point adjustments is also bounded by\nO(n).</p>\n", "title": "Ukkonen&#39;s suffix tree algorithm in plain English?", "tags": ["algorithm", "search", "suffix-tree"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9452701/ukkonens-suffix-tree-algorithm-in-plain-english/9513423#9513423", "question_id": 9452701, "answer_id": 9513423}, {"body": "<p>I tried to implement the Suffix Tree with the approach given in jogojapan's answer, but it didn't work for some cases due to wording used for the rules.

If there is no a suffix link, set the <em>active node</em> to the <em>root</em> node. Either way, <em>active edge</em> and <em>active length</em> stay unchanged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this definition of <code>Rule 3</code> we also consider the inserts of leaf nodes (not only split-nodes).</p>\n\n<p><strong>And finally, Observation 3:</strong></p>\n\n<p>When the symbol we want to add to the tree is already on the edge, we, according to <code>Observation 1</code>, update only <code>active point</code> and <code>remainder</code>, leaving the tree unchanged. <strong>BUT</strong> if there is an <em>internal node</em> marked as <em>needing suffix link</em>, we must connect that node with our current <code>active node</code> through a suffix link.</p>\n\n<p>Let's look at the example of a suffix tree for <strong>cdddcdc</strong> if we add a suffix link in such case and if we don't:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If we <strong>DON'T</strong> connect the nodes through a suffix link:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>before adding the last letter <strong>c</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/zPiF1.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>after adding the last letter <strong>c</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/5fsmd.png\" alt=\"\"></p></li>\n<li><p>If we <strong>DO</strong> connect the nodes through a suffix link:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>before adding the last letter <strong>c</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lZrAF.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>after adding the last letter <strong>c</strong>:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/XUFjk.png\" alt=\"\"></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Seems like there is no significant difference: in the second case there are two more suffix links. But these suffix links are <em>correct</em>, and one of them - from the blue node to the red one - is very <strong>important</strong> for our approach with <strong>active point</strong>. The problem is that if we don't put a suffix link here, later, when we add some new letters to the tree, we might omit adding some nodes to the tree due to the <code>Rule 3</code>, because, according to it, if there's no a suffix link, then we must put the <code>active_node</code> to the root.</p>\n\n<p>When we were adding the last letter to the tree, the red node had <strong>already existed</strong> before we made an insert from the blue node (the edge labled <strong>'c'</strong>). As there was an insert from the blue node, we mark it as <em>needing a suffix link</em>. Then, relying on the <strong>active point</strong> approach, the <code>active node</code> was set to the red node. But we don't make an insert from the red node, as the letter <strong>'c'</strong> is already on the edge. Does it mean that the blue node must be left without a suffix link? No, we must connect the blue node with the red one through a suffix link. Why is it correct? Because the <strong>active point</strong> approach guarantees that we get to a right place, i.e., to the next place where we must process an insert of a <strong>shorter</strong> suffix.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, here are my implementations of the Suffix Tree:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://pastie.org/10904255\" rel=\"nofollow\">Java</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://pastie.org/10904259\" rel=\"nofollow\">C++</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Hope that this \"overview\" combined with jogojapan's detailed answer will help somebody to implement his own Suffix Tree.</p>\n", "title": "Ukkonen&#39;s suffix tree algorithm in plain English?", "tags": ["algorithm", "search", "suffix-tree"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9452701/ukkonens-suffix-tree-algorithm-in-plain-english/14580102#14580102", "question_id": 9452701, "answer_id": 14580102}, {"body": "<p>Hi i have tried to implement the above explained implementation in ruby , please check it out.\nit seems to work fine.</p>\n\n<p>the only difference in the implementation is that , i have tried to use the edge object instead of just using symbols.</p>\n\n<p>its also present at <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/suchitpuri/9304856\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/suchitpuri/9304856</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>    require 'pry'\n\n\nclass Edge\n    attr_accessor :data , :edges , :suffix_link\n    def initialize data\n        @data = data\n        @edges = []\n        @suffix_link = nil\n    end\n\n    def find_edge element\n        self.edges.each do |edge|\n            return edge if edge.data.start_with? element\n        end\n        return nil\n    end\nend\n\nclass SuffixTrees\n    attr_accessor :root , :active_point , :remainder , :pending_prefixes , :last_split_edge , :remainder\n\n    def initialize\n        @root = Edge.new nil\n        @active_point = { active_node: @root , active_edge: nil , active_length: 0}\n        @remainder = 0\n        @pending_prefixes = []\n        @last_split_edge = nil\n        @remainder = 1\n    end\n\n    def build string\n        string.split(\"\").each_with_index do |element , index|\n\n\n            add_to_edges @root , element        \n\n            update_pending_prefix element                           \n            add_pending_elements_to_tree element\n            active_length = @active_point[:active_length]\n\n            # if(@active_point[:active_edge] &amp;&amp;

If you put your scripts in the HEAD then it means the entire page is blocked from rendering until all stylesheets and all scripts are downloaded. While it makes sense to block all rendering for stylesheets (so you get the correct styling the first time and avoid the flash of unstyled content FOUC), it doesn't make sense to block rendering of the entire page for scripts.

There are various arguments regarding why you might link to your scripts in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> versus the end of the document, but that's outside the scope of this answer.  This is strictly about whether <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>s should go before <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>s in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In modern DESKTOP browsers,</strong> it looks like linking to CSS first <strong>never</strong> provides a performance gain.  Putting CSS after script gets you a trivial amount of gain when both CSS and script are delayed, but gives you large gains when CSS is delayed.  (Shown by the <code>last</code> columns in the first set of results.)</p>\n\n<p>Given that linking to CSS last does not seem to hurt performance but <em>can</em> provide gains under certain circumstances, <strong>you should link to external stylesheets <em>after</em> you link to external scripts <em>only on desktop browsers</em></strong> if the performance of old browsers is not a concern.  <strong>Read on for the mobile situation.</strong></p>\n\n<h1>Why?</h1>\n\n<p>Historically, when a browser encountered a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag pointing to an external resource, the browser would <strong>stop</strong> parsing the HTML, retrieve the script, execute it, then continue parsing the HTML.  In contrast, if the browser encountered a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> for an external stylesheet, it would <em>continue</em> parsing the HTML while it fetched the CSS file (in parallel).</p>\n\n<p>Hence, the widely-repeated advice to put stylesheets first &ndash; they would download first, and the first script to download could be loaded in parallel.</p>\n\n<p>However, modern browsers (including all of the browsers I tested with above) have implemented <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=speculative+parsing\"><em>speculative parsing</em></a>, where the browser \"looks ahead\" in the HTML and begins downloading resources <em>before</em> scripts download and execute.</p>\n\n<p>In old browsers without speculative parsing, putting scripts first will affect performance since they will not download in parallel.</p>\n\n<h2>Browser Support</h2>\n\n<p>Speculative parsing was first implemented in: (along with the percentage of worldwide desktop browser users using this version or greater as of Jan 2012)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome 1 (WebKit 525) (100%)</li>\n<li>IE 8 (75%)</li>\n<li>Firefox 3.5 (96%)</li>\n<li>Safari 4 (99%)</li>\n<li>Opera 11.60 (85%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In total, roughly 85% of desktop browsers in use today support speculative loading.  Putting scripts before CSS will have a performance penalty on 15% of users <em>globally</em>; YMMV based on your site's specific audience.  (And remember that number is shrinking.)</p>\n\n<p>On mobile browsers, it's a little harder to get definitive numbers simply due to how heterogeneous the mobile browser and OS landscape is.  Since speculative rendering was implemented in WebKit 525 (released Mar 2008), and just about every worthwhile mobile browser is based on WebKit, we can conclude that \"most\" mobile browsers <em>should</em> support it.

Previously when looking at memcached vs redis you might have been inclined to choose memcached due to the 3rd party clustering tools available. Now redis offers clustering, and unlike memcached support is provided out-of-the-box. Being built-in provides a more robust solution that is easier to administrate. Combined with other high availability tools in-the-box like replication and Sentinel (monitoring), redis clearly has the more compelling scaling story today.</p>\n\n<p>As of today every major feature and strength memcached offers are now a subset of redis' features and strengths. Any use case you might use memcached for redis can solve equally well. They are both lightning fast as volatile caches. While that's <em>all</em> that memcached is its only the tip of the redis iceberg.</p>\n\n<p>Memcached is a volatile in-memory key/value store. Redis can act like one (and do that job as well as memcached), but it is a <strong>data structure server</strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Redis Superset</h2>\n\n<p>Here are a few of the features that redis offers which memcached doesn't and allows redis to be used as a \"real\" data store instead of just a cache.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Powerful data types and powerful commands to leverage them. Hashes, Sorted Sets, Lists, and more.</strong></li>\n<li>Persistence to disk, by default.</li>\n<li>Transactions with optimistic locking (WATCH/MULTI/EXEC)</li>\n<li>Pub/sub. Extremely fast.</li>\n<li>Values up to 512MB in size (memcached limited to 1MB per key)</li>\n<li>Lua scripting (as of 2.6)</li>\n<li>Built in clustering (as of <a href=\"http://antirez.com/news/79\">3.0</a>)</li>\n<li>Extremely fast at everything. Benchmarks are often conflicting, but this much is clear: when used like memcached Redis falls somewhere between nearly as fast or maybe even a little faster. Like memcached it is often bound by available network or memory bandwidth instead of CPU or other bottlenecks and will rarely be the culprit when your app is slowing down.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The powerful data types are particularly important. They allow redis to provide a fantastic shared queue (<a href=\"http://redis.io/commands#list\">lists</a>), a great messaging solution (<a href=\"http://redis.io/commands#pubsub\">pub/sub</a>), a good place for storing sessions (<a href=\"http://redis.io/commands#hash\">hashes</a>), and a compelling place for high score tracking (<a href=\"http://redis.io/commands#sorted_set\">sorted sets</a>). These are just a few examples that scratch the surface.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>To answer your original question: The performance and memory usage of Redis compared to memcached should be relatively similar. Close enough that for most uses any performance difference in either direction is academic as neither is likely to be the bottleneck.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you already have a large investment in memcached, going forward redis is the obvious solution. For solutions both tools would solve, go with the one that offers more flexibility for new use cases and also provides better out-of-the-box availability, scalability, and administration: redis.</p>\n\n<p>Not only is redis the better option for places you might use memcached, it enables whole new types of use cases and usage patterns.</p>\n\n<p>Memcached is a fine piece of software that is stable and hardened. If you already have a large investment in memcached then you may want to stick with it. There are many use cases where redis is as-good-as memcached but isn't better. Evaluate the benefits of redis (if any) and compare that to the cost of switching.

The <code>maxmemory</code> option does not strictly enforces upper memory limit usage. As you work with cache, keys are evicted and expired; chances are your keys are not all the same size, so internal memory fragmentation occurs.</p>\n\n<p>By default redis uses <a href=\"http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/\">jemalloc</a> memory allocator, which tries its best to be both memory-compact and fast, but it is a general purpose memory allocator and it cannot keep up with lots of allocations and object purging occuring at a high rate. Because of this, on some load patterns redis process can apparently leak memory because of internal fragmentation. For example, if you have a server with 7 Gb RAM and you want to use redis as non-persistent LRU cache, you may find that redis process with <code>maxmemory</code> set to 5Gb over time would use more and more memory, eventually hitting total RAM limit until out-of-memory killer interferes.</p>\n\n<p>memcached is a better fit to scenario described above, as it manages its memory in a completely different way. memcached allocates one big chunk of memory \u2014\u00a0everything it will ever need\u00a0\u2014 and then manages this memory by itself, using its own implemented <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_allocation\">slab allocator</a>. Moreover, memcached tries hard to keep internal fragmentation low, as it actually <a href=\"https://www.adayinthelifeof.nl/2011/02/06/memcache-internals/\">uses per-slab LRU algorithm</a>, when LRU evictions are done with object size considered.</p>\n\n<p>With that said, memcached still has a strong position in environments, where memory usage has to be enforced and/or be predictable. We've tried to use latest stable redis (2.8.19) as a drop-in non-persistent LRU-based memcached replacement in workload of 10-15k op/s, and it leaked memory A LOT; the same workload was crashing Amazon's ElastiCache redis instances in a day or so because of the same reasons.</p>\n", "title": "Memcached vs. Redis?", "tags": ["caching", "web-applications", "memcached", "redis"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10558465/memcached-vs-redis/28808386#28808386", "question_id": 10558465, "answer_id": 28808386}, {"body": "<p>I'd say redis, as it's much faster than memcached, even though it runs on a single core of a machine, and memcached can be run in parallel, it'd take a lot of processing to hit redis's upper limit when configured correctly</p>\n", "title": "Memcached vs. Redis?", "tags": ["caching", "web-applications", "memcached", "redis"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10558465/memcached-vs-redis/29007438#29007438", "question_id": 10558465, "answer_id": 29007438}, {"body": "<p>It would not be wrong, if we say that redis is combination of (cache + data structure) while memcached is just a cache.</p>\n", "title": "Memcached vs. Redis?", "tags": ["caching", "web-applications", "memcached", "redis"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10558465/memcached-vs-redis/30859661#30859661", "question_id": 10558465, "answer_id": 30859661}, {"body": "<p>I got the opportunity to use both memcached and redis together in the caching proxy that i have worked on , let me share you where exactly i have used what and reason behind same....</p>\n\n<p>Redis ></p>\n\n<p>1) Used for indexing the cache content , over the cluster .

What&#39;s distinguishing about Heroku", "tags": ["ruby-on-rails", "heroku", "amazon-web-services"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>First things first, AWS and Heroku are different things. AWS offer Infrastructure as a Service (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29\">IaaS</a>) whereas Heroku offer a Platform as a Service (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service\">PaaS</a>).</p>\n\n<p>What's the difference? Very approximately, IaaS gives you components you need in order to build things on top of it; PaaS gives you an environment where you just push code and some basic configuration and get a running application. IaaS can give you more power and flexibility, at the cost of having to build and maintain more yourself.</p>\n\n<p>To get your code running on AWS and looking a bit like a Heroku deployment, you'll want some EC2 instances - you'll want a load balancer / caching layer installed on them (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.varnish-cache.org/\">Varnish</a>), you'll want instances running something like <a href=\"http://www.modrails.com/\">Passenger</a> and <a href=\"http://nginx.org/\">nginx</a> to serve your code, you'll want to deploy and configure a clustered database instance of something like <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a>. You'll want a deployment system with something like <a href=\"https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki\">Capistrano</a>, and something doing log aggregation. </p>\n\n<p>That's not an insignificant amount of work to set up and maintain. With Heroku, the effort required to get to that sort of stage is maybe a few lines of application code and a <code>git push</code>. </p>\n\n<p>So you're this far, and you want to scale up. Great. You're using <a href=\"http://puppetlabs.com/\">Puppet</a> for your EC2 deployment, right? So now you configure your Capistrano files to spin up/down instances as needed; you re-jig your Puppet config so Varnish is aware of web-worker instances and will automatically pool between them. Or you <code>heroku scale web:+5</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that gives you an idea of the comparison between the two. Now to address your specific points:</p>\n\n<h2>Speed</h2>\n\n<p>Currently Heroku only runs on AWS instances in <code>us-east</code> and <code>eu-west</code>. For you, this sounds like what you want anyway. For others, it's potentially more of a consideration.</p>\n\n<h2>Security</h2>\n\n<p>I've seen a lot of internally-maintained production servers that are way behind on security updates, or just generally poorly put together. With Heroku, you have someone else managing that sort of thing, which is either a blessing or a curse depending on how you look at it! </p>\n\n<p>When you deploy, you're effectively handing your code straight over to Heroku. This may be an issue for you. Their article on <a href=\"http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-isolation\">Dyno Isolation</a> details their isolation technologies (it seems as though multiple dynos are run on individual EC2 instances). Several colleagues have expressed issues with these technologies and the strength of their isolation; I am alas not in a position of enough knowledge / experience to really comment, but my current Heroku deployments consider that \"good enough\". It may be an issue for you, I don't know.</p>\n\n<h2>Scaling</h2>\n\n<p>I touched on how one might implement this in my IaaS vs PaaS comparison above. Approximately, your application has a <code>Procfile</code>, which has lines of the form <code>dyno_type: command_to_run</code>, so for example (cribbed from <a href=\"http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/process-model\">http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/process-model</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>web:    bundle exec rails server\nworker: bundle exec rake jobs:work\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This, with a:</p>\n\n<pre><code>heroku scale web:2 worker:10\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will result in you having 2 <code>web</code> dynos and 10 <code>worker</code> dynos running. Nice, simple, easy. Note that <code>web</code> is a special dyno type, which has access to the outside world, and is behind their nice web traffic multiplexer (probably some sort of Varnish / nginx combination) that will route traffic accordingly. Your workers probably interact with a message queue for similar routing, from which they'll get the location via a URL in the environment.</p>\n\n<h2>Cost Efficiency</h2>\n\n<p>Lots of people have lots of different opinions about this. Currently it's $0.05/hr for a dyno hour, compared to $0.025/hr for an AWS micro instance or $0.09/hr for an AWS small instance.</p>\n\n<p>Heroku's <a href=\"http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos\">dyno documentation</a> says you have about 512MB of RAM, so it's probably not <em>too</em> unreasonable to consider a dyno as a bit like an EC2 micro instance. Is it worth double the price? How much do you value your time? The amount of time and effort required to build on top of an IaaS offering to get it to this standard is definitely not cheap. I can't really answer this question for you, but don't underestimate the 'hidden costs' of setup and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p>(A bit of an aside, but if I connect to a dyno from here (<code>heroku run bash</code>), a cursory look shows 4 cores in <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> and 36GB of RAM - this leads me to believe that I'm on a <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">\"High-Memory Double Extra Large Instance\"</a>. The Heroku <a href=\"http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos\">dyno documentation</a> says each dyno receives 512MB of RAM, so I'm potentially sharing with up to 71 other dynos. (I don't have enough data about the homogeny of Heroku's AWS instances, so your milage may vary))</p>\n\n<h2>How do they fare against their competitors?</h2>\n\n<p>This, I'm afraid I can't really help you with. The only competitor I've ever really looked at was <a href=\"http://code.google.com/appengine/\">Google App Engine</a> - at the time I was looking to deploy Java applications, and <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/wiki/WillItPlayInJava\">the amount of restrictions on usable frameworks and technologies</a> was incredibly off-putting. This is more than \"just a Java thing\" - the amount of general restrictions and necessary considerations (<a href=\"http://code.google.com/appengine/kb/general.html\">the FAQ</a> hints at several) seemed less than convenient. In contrast, deploying to Heroku has been a dream.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>I hope this answers your questions (please comment if there are gaps / other areas you'd like addressed). I feel I should offer my personal position. I love Heroku for \"quick deployments\". When I'm starting an application, and I want some cheap hosting (the Heroku free tier is awesome - essentially if you only need one web dyno and 5MB of PostgreSQL, it's free to host an application), Heroku is my go-to position. For \"Serious Production Deployment\" with several paying customers, with a service-level-agreement, with dedicated time to spend on ops, et cetera, I can't quite bring myself to offload that much control to Heroku, and then either AWS or our own servers have been the hosting platform of choice.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, it's about what works best for you. You say you're \"a beginner programmer\" - it might just be that using Heroku will let you focus on writing Ruby, and not have to spend time getting all the other infrastructure around your code built up. I'd definitely give it a try.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note, AWS does actually have a PaaS offering, <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/\">Elastic Beanstalk</a>, that supports Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Python, .NET and Java. I think generally most people, when they see \"AWS\", jump to things like EC2 and S3 and EBS, which are definitely IaaS offerings</p>\n", "title": "Why do people use Heroku when AWS is present?

Yet PHP has 2 major issues when it comes to real time applications: </p>\n\n<p>1) PHP started as a very basic CGI. PHP has progressed very far since it's early stage, but it happened in small steps. PHP already had many millions of users by the time it became the embed-able and flexible C library that it is today, most of whom were dependent on it's earlier model of execution, so it hasn't yet made a solid attempt to escape the cgi model internally. Even the commandline interface invokes the PHP library (libphp5.so on linux, php5ts.dll on windows, etc) as if it still a cgi processing a GET/POST request. It still executes code as if it just has to build a \"page\" and then end it's life cycle. As a result, it has very little support for multi-thread or event driven programming (within PHP userspace), making it currently unpractical for real time, multi-user applications. </p>\n\n<p>Note that PHP does have extensions to provide event loops (such as libevent) and threads (such as pthreads) in PHP userspace, but very, very, few of the applications use these.</p>\n\n<p>2) PHP still has significant issues with garbage collection. Although these issues have been consistently improving (likely it's greatest step to end the life cycle as described above), even the best attempts at creating long running PHP applications require being restarted on a regular basis. This also make it unpractical for real time applications.</p>\n\n<p>PHP 7 will be a great step to fix these issues as well, and seems very promising as a platform for real-time applications. </p>\n", "title": "What are Long-Polling, Websockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE) and Comet?", "tags": ["php", "websocket", "comet", "long-polling", "server-sent-events"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11077857/what-are-long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events-sse-and-comet/26354684#26354684", "question_id": 11077857, "answer_id": 26354684}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11077857/what-are-long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events-sse-and-comet", "question_id": 11077857}, {"body": "<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Possible Duplicate:</strong><br>\n  <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3573623/is-it-possible-to-preview-stash-appplication-in-git\">Is it possible to preview stash appplication in git?</a>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I see <a href=\"http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Stashing\">here</a> you can apply/unapply a stash and even create a new branch off of a stash.

As per <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.1\">\u00a79.1</a>, converting an object (in this case an array) to a primitive returns its default value, which for objects with a valid <code>toString()</code> method is the result of calling <code>object.toString()</code> (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.12.8\">\u00a78.12.8</a>). For arrays this is the same as calling <code>array.join()</code> (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.4.2\">\u00a715.4.4.2</a>). Joining an empty array results in an empty string, so step #7 of the addition operator returns the concatenation of two empty strings, which is the empty string.</p></li>\n<li><h3><code>[] + {}</code></h3>\n\n<p>Similar to <code>[] + []</code>, both operands are converted to primitives first. For \"Object objects\" (\u00a715.2), this is again the result of calling <code>object.toString()</code>, which for non-null, non-undefined objects is <code>\"[object Object]\"</code> (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.2.4.2\">\u00a715.2.4.2</a>).</p></li>\n<li><h3><code>{} + []</code></h3>\n\n<p>The <code>{}</code> here is not parsed as an object, but instead as an empty block (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-12.1\">\u00a712.1</a>, at least as long as you're not forcing that statement to be an expression, but more about that later). The return value of empty blocks is empty, so the result of that statement is the same as <code>+[]</code>. The unary <code>+</code> operator (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.4.6\">\u00a711.4.6</a>) returns <code>ToNumber(ToPrimitive(operand))</code>. As we already know, <code>ToPrimitive([])</code> is the empty string, and according to <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.3.1\">\u00a79.3.1</a>, <code>ToNumber(\"\")</code> is 0.</p></li>\n<li><h3><code>{} + {}</code></h3>\n\n<p>Similar to the previous case, the first <code>{}</code> is parsed as a block with empty return value. Again, <code>+{}</code> is the same as <code>ToNumber(ToPrimitive({}))</code>, and <code>ToPrimitive({})</code> is <code>\"[object Object]\"</code> (see <code>[] + {}</code>). So to get the result of <code>+{}</code>, we have to apply <code>ToNumber</code> on the string <code>\"[object Object]\"</code>. When following the steps from <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.3.1\">\u00a79.3.1</a>, we get <code>NaN</code> as a result:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the grammar cannot interpret the String as an expansion of <em>StringNumericLiteral</em>, then the result of <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.3\">ToNumber</a> is <strong>NaN</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><h3><code>Array(16).join(\"wat\" - 1)</code></h3>\n\n<p>As per <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.1.1\">\u00a715.4.1.1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.2.2\">\u00a715.4.2.2</a>, <code>Array(16)</code> creates a new array with length 16. To get the value of the argument to join, <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.6.2\">\u00a711.6.2</a> steps #5 and #6 show that we have to convert both operands to a number using <code>ToNumber</code>. <code>ToNumber(1)</code> is simply 1 (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.3\">\u00a79.3</a>), whereas <code>ToNumber(\"wat\")</code> again is <code>NaN</code> as per <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.3.1\">\u00a79.3.1</a>. Following step 7 of <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.6.2\">\u00a711.6.2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.6.3\">\u00a711.6.3</a> dictates that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If either operand is <strong>NaN</strong>, the result is <strong>NaN</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the argument to <code>Array(16).join</code> is <code>NaN</code>. Following \u00a715.4.4.5 (<code>Array.prototype.join</code>), we have to call <code>ToString</code> on the argument, which is <code>\"NaN\"</code> (<a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.8.1\">\u00a79.8.1</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If <em>m</em> is <strong>NaN</strong>, return the String <strong><code>\"NaN\"</code></strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Following step 10 of <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.4.4.5\">\u00a715.4.4.5</a>, we get 15 repetitions of the concatenation of <code>\"NaN\"</code> and the empty string, which equals the result you're seeing.\nWhen using <code>\"wat\" + 1</code> instead of <code>\"wat\" - 1</code> as argument, the addition operator converts <code>1</code> to a string instead of converting <code>\"wat\"</code> to a number, so it effectively calls <code>Array(16).join(\"wat1\")</code>.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As to why you're seeing different results for the <code>{} + []</code> case: When using it as a function argument, you're forcing the statement to be an <em>ExpressionStatement</em>, which makes it impossible to parse <code>{}</code> as empty block, so it's instead parsed as an empty object literal.</p>\n", "title": "What is the explanation for these bizarre JavaScript behaviours mentioned in the &#39;Wat&#39; talk for CodeMash 2012?", "tags": ["javascript"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9032856/what-is-the-explanation-for-these-bizarre-javascript-behaviours-mentioned-in-the/9033306#9033306", "question_id": 9032856, "answer_id": 9033306}, {"body": "<p>I second @Ventero\u2019s solution.

If it returns a primitive, you are done. Direct instances of <code>Object</code> and arrays return themselves, so you are not done yet.</li>\n<li>Call <code>obj.toString()</code>. If it returns a primitive, you are done. <code>{}</code> and <code>[]</code> both return a string, so you are done.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, throw a <code>TypeError</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For dates, step 1 and 2 are swapped. You can observe the conversion behavior as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var obj = {\n    valueOf: function () {\n        console.log(\"valueOf\");\n        return {}; // not a primitive\n    },\n    toString: function () {\n        console.log(\"toString\");\n        return {}; // not a primitive\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Interaction (<code>Number()</code> first converts to primitive then to number):</p>\n\n<pre><code>&gt; Number(obj)\nvalueOf\ntoString\nTypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Second step (\u00a711.6.1):</strong> If one of the operands is a string, the other operand is also converted to string and the result is produced by concatenating two strings. Otherwise, both operands are converted to numbers and the result is produced by adding them.</p>\n\n<p>More detailed explanation of the conversion process: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.2ality.com/2012/01/object-plus-object.html\">What is {} + {} in JavaScript?</a>\u201d</p>\n", "title": "What is the explanation for these bizarre JavaScript behaviours mentioned in the &#39;Wat&#39; talk for CodeMash 2012?", "tags": ["javascript"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9032856/what-is-the-explanation-for-these-bizarre-javascript-behaviours-mentioned-in-the/9059527#9059527", "question_id": 9032856, "answer_id": 9059527}, {"body": "<p>We may refer to the specification and that's great and most accurate, but most of the cases can also be explained in a more comprehensible way with the following statements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>+</code> and <code>-</code> operators work only with primitive values.

This one deserves more explanation (see Ventero answer). In that case, curly braces are treated not as an object but as an empty block, so it turns out to be same as <code>+[]</code>. Unary <code>+</code> works only with numbers, so the implementation tries to get a number out of <code>[]</code>. First it tries <code>valueOf</code> which in the case of arrays returns the same object, so then it tries the last resort: conversion of a <code>toString</code> result to a number.

I wanted to correct your JSFiddle code. However, I posted this on Hacker News and someone suggested that I repost it here.</p>\n\n<p>The problem in the JSFiddle code is that <code>({})</code> (opening braces inside of parentheses) is not the same as <code>{}</code> (opening braces as the start of a line of code). So when you type <code>out({} + [])</code> you are forcing the <code>{}</code> to be something which it is not when you type <code>{} + []</code>. This is part of the overall 'wat'-ness of Javascript.</p>\n\n<p>The basic idea was simple JavaScript wanted to allow both of these forms:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (u)\n    v;\n\nif (x) {\n    y;\n    z;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To do so, two interpretations were made of the opening brace: 1. it is <em>not required</em> and 2. it can appear <em>anywhere</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This was a wrong move. Real code doesn't have an opening brace appearing in the middle of nowhere, and real code also tends to be more fragile when it uses the first form rather than the second. (About once every other month at my last job, I'd get called to a coworker's desk when their modifications to my code weren't working, and the problem was that they'd added a line to the \"if\" without adding curly braces. I eventually just adopted the habit that the curly braces are always required, even when you're only writing one line.)</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately in many cases eval() will replicate the full wat-ness of JavaScript. The JSFiddle code should read:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function out(code) {\n    function format(x) {\n        return typeof x === \"string\" ?\n            JSON.stringify(x) : x;\n    }   \n    document.writeln('&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ' + code);\n    document.writeln(format(eval(code)));\n}\ndocument.writeln(\"&lt;pre&gt;\");\nout('[] + []');\nout('[] + {}');\nout('{} + []');\nout('{} + {}');\nout('Array(16).join(\"wat\" + 1)');\nout('Array(16).join(\"wat - 1\")');\nout('Array(16).join(\"wat\" - 1) + \" Batman!\"');\ndocument.writeln(\"&lt;/pre&gt;\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>[Also that is the first time I have written document.writeln in many many many years, and I feel a little dirty writing anything involving both document.writeln() and eval().]</p>\n", "title": "What is the explanation for these bizarre JavaScript behaviours mentioned in the &#39;Wat&#39; talk for CodeMash 2012?", "tags": ["javascript"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9032856/what-is-the-explanation-for-these-bizarre-javascript-behaviours-mentioned-in-the/9068992#9068992", "question_id": 9032856, "answer_id": 9068992}, {"body": "<p>To buttress what has been shared earlier.</p>\n\n<p>The underlying cause of this behaviour is partly due to the weakly-typed nature of JavaScript.

Here's the bytecode for the function's loop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &gt;&gt;   13 FOR_ITER                 6 (to 22)   # get next value from iterator\n         16 STORE_FAST               0 (x)       # set local variable\n         19 JUMP_ABSOLUTE           13           # back to FOR_ITER\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Normally when a programme is run, Python executes each opcode one after the other, keeping track of the a stack and preforming other checks on the stack frame after each opcode is executed. Opcode prediction means that in certain cases Python is able to jump directly to the next opcode, thus avoiding some of this overhead.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, every time Python sees <code>FOR_ITER</code> (the top of the loop), it will \"predict\" that <code>STORE_FAST</code> is the next opcode it has to execute. Python then peeks at the next opcode and, if the prediction was correct, it jumps straight to <code>STORE_FAST</code>. This has the effect of squeezing the two opcodes into a single opcode.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the <code>STORE_NAME</code> opcode is used in the loop at the global level. Python does <em>not</em> make similar predictions when it sees this opcode. Instead, it must go back to the top of the evaluation-loop which has obvious implications for the speed at which the loop is executed.</p>\n\n<p>To give some more technical detail about this optimisation, here's a quote from the <a href=\"https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/45b1ae1ef318/Python/ceval.c#l784\"><code>ceval.c</code></a> file (the \"engine\" of Python's virtual machine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some opcodes tend to come in pairs thus making it possible to\n   predict the second code when the first is run.  For example,\n   <code>GET_ITER</code> is often followed by <code>FOR_ITER</code>. And <strong><code>FOR_ITER</code> is often\n   followed by <code>STORE_FAST</code></strong> or <code>UNPACK_SEQUENCE</code>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Verifying the prediction costs a single high-speed test of a register\n      variable against a constant.  If the pairing was good, then the\n      processor's own internal branch predication has a high likelihood of\n      success, resulting in a nearly zero-overhead transition to the\n      next opcode.  A successful prediction saves a trip through the eval-loop\n      including its two unpredictable branches, the <code>HAS_ARG</code> test and the\n      switch-case.  Combined with the processor's internal branch prediction,\n      a successful <code>PREDICT</code> has the effect of making the two opcodes run as if\n      they were a single new opcode with the bodies combined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can see in the source code for the <a href=\"https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/45b1ae1ef318/Python/ceval.c#l2493\"><code>FOR_ITER</code></a> opcode exactly where the prediction for <code>STORE_FAST</code> is made:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-C prettyprint-override\"><code>case FOR_ITER:                         // the FOR_ITER opcode case\n    v = TOP();\n    x = (*v-&gt;ob_type-&gt;tp_iternext)(v); // x is the next value from iterator\n    if (x != NULL) {                     \n        PUSH(x);                       // put x on top of the stack\n        PREDICT(STORE_FAST);           // predict STORE_FAST will follow - success!\n        PREDICT(UNPACK_SEQUENCE);      // this and everything below is skipped\n        continue;\n    }\n    // error-checking and more code for when the iterator ends normally                                     \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>PREDICT</code> function expands to <code>if (*next_instr == op) goto PRED_##op</code> i.e. we just jump to the start of the predicted opcode.

The objectivity of the author of your quote is questionable, as evidenced by the fact that it ends with</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>or I will stab you</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, be aware that signals (by default) throw exceptions, and normally long-running processes are terminated through a signal, so catching Exception and not terminating on signal exceptions will make your program very hard to stop.  So don't do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/ruby\n\nwhile true do\n  begin\n    line = STDIN.gets\n    # heavy processing\n  rescue Exception =&gt; e\n    puts \"caught exception #{e}! ohnoes!\"\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>No, really, don't do it.  Don't even run that to see if it works.</p>\n\n<p>However, say you have a threaded server and you want all exceptions to not:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>be ignored (the default)</li>\n<li>stop the server (which happens if you say <code>thread.abort_on_exception = true</code>).  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Then this is perfectly acceptable in your connection handling thread:</p>\n\n<pre><code>begin\n  # do stuff\nrescue Exception =&gt; e\n  myLogger.error(\"uncaught #{e} exception while handling connection: #{e.message}\")\n    myLogger.error(\"Stack trace: #{backtrace.map {|l| \"  #{l}\\n\"}.join}\")\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above works out to a variation of Ruby's default exception handler, with the advantage that it doesn't also kill your program.  Rails does this in its request handler.</p>\n\n<p>Signal exceptions are raised in the main thread.  Background threads won't get them, so there is no point in trying to catch them there.</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly useful in a production environment, where you do <em>not</em> want your program to simply stop whenever something goes wrong. Then you can take the stack dumps in your logs and add to your code to deal with specific exception further down the call chain and in a more graceful manner.</p>\n\n<p>Note also that there is another Ruby idiom which has much the same effect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a = do_something rescue \"something else\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this line, if <code>do_something</code> raises an exception, it is caught by Ruby, thrown away, and <code>a</code> is assigned <code>\"something else\"</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, don't do that, except in special cases where you <em>know</em> you don't need to worry.  One example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>debugger rescue nil\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The <code>debugger</code> function is a rather nice way to set a breakpoint in your code, but if running outside a debugger, and Rails, it raises an exception.  Now theoretically you shouldn't be leaving debug code lying around in your program (pff! nobody does that!)  but you might want to keep it there for a while for some reason, but not continually run your debugger.</p>\n\n<p>Note:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If you've run someone else's program that catches signal exceptions and ignores them, (say the code above) then:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>in Linux, in a shell, type <code>pgrep ruby</code>, or <code>ps | grep ruby</code>, look for your offending program's PID, and then run <code>kill -9 &lt;PID&gt;</code>.   </li>\n<li>in Windows, use the Task Manager (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd>ESC</kbd>), go to the \"processes\" tab, find your process, right click it and select \"End process\".</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>If you are working with someone else's program which is, for whatever reason, peppered with these ignore-exception blocks, then putting this at the top of the mainline is one possible cop-out:</p>\n\n<pre><code>%W/INT QUIT TERM/.each { |sig| trap sig,\"SYSTEM_DEFAULT\" }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This causes the program to respond to the normal termination signals by immediately terminating, bypassing exception handlers,  <em>with no cleanup</em>.  So it could cause data loss or similar.  Be careful!</p></li>\n<li><p>If you need to do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>begin\n  do_something\nrescue Exception =&gt; e\n  critical_cleanup\n  raise\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>you can actually do this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>begin\n  do_something\nensure\n  critical_cleanup\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the second case, <code>critical cleanup</code> will be called every time, whether or not an exception is thrown.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "Why is it bad style to `rescue Exception =&gt; e` in Ruby?", "tags": ["ruby", "exception-handling"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10048173/why-is-it-bad-style-to-rescue-exception-e-in-ruby/10052064#10052064", "question_id": 10048173, "answer_id": 10052064}, {"body": "<p>Let's say you are in a car (running Ruby).

A half-full can of Coke spills over the papers. The groceries in the back are crushed, and most are covered in egg yolk and milk. The car needs serious repair and cleaning. (Data Loss) </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully you have insurance (Backups). Oh yeah - because the airbag didn't inflate, you're probably hurt (getting fired, etc).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But wait! There's <del>more</del> reasons why you might want to use <code>rescue Exception =&gt; e</code>!</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you're that car, and you want to make sure the airbag inflates if the car is going more than 5mph before stopping.</p>\n\n<pre><code> begin \n    # do driving stuff\n rescue Exception =&gt; e\n    self.airbags.inflate if self.speed &gt;= 5.mph \n    raise\n end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here's the exception to the rule: You can catch <code>Exception</code> <strong>only if you re-raise the exception</strong>. So, a better rule is to never swallow <code>Exception</code>, and always re-raise the error.</p>\n\n<p>But adding rescue is both easy to forget in a language like Ruby, and putting a rescue statement right before re-raising an issue feels a little non-DRY. And you <strong>do not</strong> want to forget the <code>raise</code> statement. And if you do, good luck trying to find that error.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, Ruby is awesome, you can just use the <code>ensure</code> keyword, which makes sure the code runs. The <code>ensure</code> keyword will run the code no matter what - if an exception is thrown, if one isn't, the only exception being if the world ends (or other unlikely events).</p>\n\n<pre><code> begin \n    # do driving stuff\n ensure\n    self.airbags.inflate if self.speed &gt;= 5.mph \n end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Boom! And that code should run anyways. The only reason you should use <code>rescue Exception =&gt; e</code> is if you need access to the exception, or if you only want code to run on an exception. And remember to re-raise the error. Every time. Or you will have 3 people stabbing you (including your boss).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n\n<p>Don't <code>rescue Exception =&gt; e</code> (and not re-raise the exception) - or you <em>might</em> drive off a bridge.</p>\n", "title": "Why is it bad style to `rescue Exception =&gt; e` in Ruby?", "tags": ["ruby", "exception-handling"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10048173/why-is-it-bad-style-to-rescue-exception-e-in-ruby/35121040#35121040", "question_id": 10048173, "answer_id": 35121040}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10048173/why-is-it-bad-style-to-rescue-exception-e-in-ruby", "question_id": 10048173}, {"body": "<p>How can I reset the auto-increment of a field?

The steps are same as above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>use weather</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>db.dropDatabase()</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you like to know more about it, please have a look \n<a href=\"http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/dropDatabase/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/command/dropDatabase/</a></p>\n", "title": "How do I drop a MongoDB database from the command line?", "tags": ["mongodb"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8857276/how-do-i-drop-a-mongodb-database-from-the-command-line/32024334#32024334", "question_id": 8857276, "answer_id": 32024334}, {"body": "<p>Using Javascript, you can easily create a script.js to drop your database:</p>\n\n<h1>script.js</h1>\n\n<pre><code>use bad_db\ndb.dropDatabase()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Than run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mongo &lt; script.js\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "How do I drop a MongoDB database from the command line?", "tags": ["mongodb"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8857276/how-do-i-drop-a-mongodb-database-from-the-command-line/39047289#39047289", "question_id": 8857276, "answer_id": 39047289}, {"body": "<p>connect with <code>mongoDB</code> using your <code>terminal</code> or <code>command prompt</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>run <code>mongo</code> command, this will start the connection.</li>\n<li>then run <code>show dbs</code> command, this will show all the available/created/existing <code>databases</code> you have.</li>\n<li>then <code>select</code> the <code>database</code> you want to <code>drop/delete</code> with this command , ex : think your database name is <code>myfirst</code> then run <code>use myfirst</code>. this will switch to <code>myfirst</code> database.</li>\n<li>Now you can delete the database with this command, run <code>db.dropDatabase()</code>.this will delete selected database.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>hope this will help to you.</p>\n", "title": "How do I drop a MongoDB database from the command line?", "tags": ["mongodb"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8857276/how-do-i-drop-a-mongodb-database-from-the-command-line/39071965#39071965", "question_id": 8857276, "answer_id": 39071965}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8857276/how-do-i-drop-a-mongodb-database-from-the-command-line", "question_id": 8857276}, {"body": "<p>I had a problem with my mac where I couldn't save any kind of file on the disk anymore.\nI had to reboot OSX lion and reset the permissions on files and acls.</p>\n\n<p>But now when I want to commit a repository I get the following error from ssh:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Permissions 0777 for '/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.\nIt is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.\nThis private key will be ignored.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What permissions levels should i give to the id_rsa file?</p>\n", "title": "ssh &quot;permissions are too open&quot; error", "tags": ["permissions", "ssh"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>0600 is what mine is set at (and it's working)</p>\n", "title": "ssh &quot;permissions are too open&quot; error", "tags": ["permissions", "ssh"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9270734/ssh-permissions-are-too-open-error/9270752#9270752", "question_id": 9270734, "answer_id": 9270752}, {"body": "<p>Keys need to be only readable by you:</p>\n\n<pre><code>chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>edit:</strong> <em>600</em> appears to be fine as well (in fact better, per comment), have a peek at <a href=\"http://bodhizazen.net/Tutorials/SSH_keys\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>edit again:</strong>\nThe relevant portion from the manpage (<code>man ssh</code>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code> ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n         Contains the private key for authentication.

From my perspective, and I work with both Solr(Cloud and non-Cloud) and ElasticSearch on a daily basis, here are some interesting differences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Community: Solr has a bigger, more mature user, dev, and contributor community.  ES has a smaller, but active community of users and a growing community of contributors</li>\n<li>Maturity: Solr is more mature, but ES has grown rapidly and I consider it stable</li>\n<li>Performance: hard to judge.  I/we have not done direct performance benchmarks.  A person at LinkedIn did compare Solr vs. ES vs. Sensei once, but the initial results should be ignored because they used non-expert setup for both Solr and ES.</li>\n<li>Design: People love Solr.  The Java API is somewhat verbose, but people like how it's put together.  Solr code is unfortunately not always very pretty.  Also, ES has sharding, real-time replication, document and routing built-in.  While some of this exists in Solr, too, it feels a bit like an after-thought.</li>\n<li>Support: there are companies providing tech and consulting support for both Solr and ElasticSearch.  I think the only company that provides support for both is Sematext (disclosure: I'm Sematext founder)</li>\n<li>Scalability: both can be scaled to very large clusters.  ES is easier to scale than pre-Solr 4.0 version of Solr, but with Solr 4.0 that's no longer the case.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more thorough coverage of Solr vs. ElasticSearch topic have a look at <a href=\"http://blog.sematext.com/2012/08/23/solr-vs-elasticsearch-part-1-overview/\">http://blog.sematext.com/2012/08/23/solr-vs-elasticsearch-part-1-overview/</a> .

That being said, some of the code felt non-intuitive to me. So, I reached out to one component of the ELK stack, Kibana, from an open source perspective, and found that I could generate the somewhat cryptic code of elasticsearch very easily in Kibana. Also, I could pull Chrome Sense es queries into Kibana as well. If you use Kibana to evaluate es, it will further speed up your evaluation. What took hours to run on other platforms was up and running in JSON in Sense on top of elasticsearch (RESTful interface) in a few minutes at worst (largest data sets); in seconds at best. The documentation for elasticsearch, while 700+ pages, didn't answer questions I had that normally would be resolved in SOLR or other Lucene documentation, which obviously took more time to analyze. Also, you may want to take a look at Aggregates in elastic-search, which have taken Faceting to a new level. </p>\n\n<p>Bigger picture: if you're doing data science, text analytics, or computational linguistics, elasticsearch has some ranking algorithms that seem to innovate well in the information retrieval area. If you're using any TF/IDF algorithms, Text Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency, elasticsearch extends this 1960's algorithm to a new level, even using BM25, Best Match 25, and other Relevancy Ranking algorithms. So, if you are scoring or ranking words, phrases or sentences, elasticsearch does this scoring on the fly, without the large overhead of other data analytics approaches that take hours--another elasticsearch time savings. \nWith es, combining some of the strengths of bucketing from aggregations with the real-time JSON data relevancy scoring and ranking, you could find a winning combination, depending on either your agile (stories) or architectural(use cases) approach.</p>\n\n<p>Note: did see a similar discussion on aggregations above, but not on aggregations and relevancy scoring--my apology for any overlap.\nDisclosure: I don't work for elastic and won't be able to benefit in the near future from their excellent work due to a different architecural path, unless I do some charity work with elasticsearch, which wouldn't be a bad idea</p>\n", "title": "Solr vs. ElasticSearch", "tags": ["search", "solr", "lucene", "elasticsearch"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10213009/solr-vs-elasticsearch/35166184#35166184", "question_id": 10213009, "answer_id": 35166184}, {"body": "<p>I have use Elasticsearch for 3 years and Solr for about a month, I feel elasticsearch cluster is quite easy to install as compared to Solr installation.

If so, execute all ready handlers.</li>\n<li>If we haven't installed event listeners yet to know when the document becomes ready, then install them now.</li>\n<li>If <code>document.addEventListener</code> exists, then install event handlers using <code>.addEventListener()</code> for both <code>\"DOMContentLoaded\"</code> and <code>\"load\"</code> events.  The \"load\" is a backup event for safety and should not be needed.</li>\n<li>If <code>document.addEventListener</code> doesn't exist, then install event handlers using <code>.attachEvent()</code> for <code>\"onreadystatechange\"</code> and <code>\"onload\"</code> events.</li>\n<li>In the <code>onreadystatechange</code> event, check to see if the <code>document.readyState === \"complete\"</code> and if so, call a function to fire all the ready handlers.</li>\n<li>In all the other event handlers, call a function to fire all the ready handlers.</li>\n<li>In the function to call all the ready handlers, check a state variable to see if we've already fired.

For various reasons that function may become part of the Java JDK through the JCP (Java Community Process)</p>\n\n<p>Hibernate (in 2003) provided a way to abstract SQL and allow developers to think more in terms of persisting objects (ORM). You notify hibernate about your Entity objects and it automatically generates the strategy to persist them. Hibernate provided an implementation to do this and the API to drive the implementation either through XML config or annotations.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental issue now is that your code becomes tightly coupled with a specific vendor(Hibernate) for what a lot of people thought should be more generic. Hence the need for a generic persistence API.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the JCP with a lot of input from Hibernate and other ORM tool vendors was developing JSR 220 (Java Specification Request) which resulted in JPA 1.0 (2006) and eventually JSR 317 which is JPA 2.0 (2009). These are specifications of a generic Java Persistence API. The API is provided in the JDK as a set of interfaces so that your classes can depend on the javax.persistence and not worry about the particular vendor that is doing the work of persisting your objects. This is only the API and not the implementation. Hibernate now becomes one of the many vendors that implement the JPA 2.0 specification. You can code toward JPA and pick whatever compliant ORM vendor suits your needs.</p>\n\n<p>There are cases where Hibernate may give you features that are not codified in JPA. In this case, you can choose to insert a Hibernate specific annotation directly in your class since JPA does not provide the interface to do that thing.</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/16ovek/understanding_when_to_use_jpa_vs_hibernate/\">http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/16ovek/understanding_when_to_use_jpa_vs_hibernate/</a></p>\n", "title": "What&#39;s the difference between JPA and Hibernate?", "tags": ["java", "hibernate", "java-ee", "orm", "jpa-2.0"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9881611/whats-the-difference-between-jpa-and-hibernate/21993987#21993987", "question_id": 9881611, "answer_id": 21993987}, {"body": "<p>JPA is just a specification.In market there are many vendors which implements JPA.

Is this the correct way to build a self-signed certificate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Its easy to create a self signed certificate. You just use the <code>openssl req</code> command. It can be tricky to create one that can be consumed by the largest selection of clients, like browsers and command line tools.</p>\n\n<p>Its difficult because the browsers have their own set of requirements, and they are more restrictive than the IETF. The requirements used by browsers are documented at the <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/\">CA/Browser Forums</a> (see references below). The restrictions arise in two key areas: (1) trust anchors, and (2) DNS names.</p>\n\n<p>Modern browsers (like the warez we're using in 2014/2015) want a certificate that chains back to a trust anchor, and they want DNS names to be presented in particular ways in the certificate. And Browsers are actively moving against self signed server certificates</p>\n\n<p>Some browsers don't exactly make it easy to import a self signed server certificate. In fact, you can't with some browsers, like Android's browser. So the complete solution is to become your own authority.</p>\n\n<p>In the absence of becoming your own authority, you have to get the DNS names right to give the certificate the greatest chance of success. But I would encourage you to become your own authority. Its easy to become your own authority and it will side step all the trust issues (who better to trust than yourself?).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is probably not the site you are looking for!<br>\n  The site's security certificate is not trusted!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is because browsers use a predefined list of trust anchors to validate server certificates. A self signed certificate does not chain back to a trusted anchor.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to avoid this is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create your own authority (i.e, become a CA)</li>\n<li>Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the server</li>\n<li>Sign the server's CSR with your CA key</li>\n<li>Install the server certificate on the server</li>\n<li>Install the CA certificate on the client</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Step 1 - <em>Create your own authority</em> just means to create a self signed certificate with <code>CA: true</code> and proper key usage. That means the Subject and Issuer are the same entity, CA is set to true in Basic Constraints (it should also be marked as critical), key usage is <code>keyCertSign</code> and <code>crlSign</code> (if you are using CRLs), and the Subject Key Identifier (SKI) is the same as the Authority Key Identifier (AKI).</p>\n\n<p>To become your own certificate authority, see <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/21340898/608639\">How do you sign Certificate Signing Request with your Certification Authority?</a> on Stack Overflow. Then, import your CA into the Trust Store used by the browser.</p>\n\n<p>Steps 2 - 4 are roughly what you do now for a public facing server when you enlist the services of a CA like <a href=\"https://www.startssl.com/\">Startcom</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cacert.org/\">CAcert</a>. Steps 1 and 5 allows you to avoid the third party authority, and act as your own authority (who better to trust than yourself?).</p>\n\n<p>The next best way to avoid the browser warning is to trust the server's certificate. But some browsers, like Android's default browser, do not let you do it. So it will never work on the platform.</p>\n\n<p>The issue of browsers (and other similar user agents) <em>not</em> trusting self signed certificates is going to be a big problem in the Internet of Things (IoT). For example, what is going to happen when you connect to your thermostat or refrigerator to program it? The answer is, nothing good as far as the user experience is concerned.</p>\n\n<p>The W3C's WebAppSec Working Group is starting to look at the issue.  See, for example, <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2014Dec/0203.html\">Proposal: Marking HTTP As Non-Secure</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How to create a self-signed certificate with openssl?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The commands below and the configuration file create a self signed certificate (it also shows you how to create a signing request). They differ from other answers in one respect: the DNS names used for the self signed certificate are in the <em>Subject Alternate Name (SAN)</em>, and not the <em>Common Name (CN)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The DNS names are placed in the SAN through the configuration file with the line <code>subjectAltName = @alternate_names</code> (there's no way to do it through the command line). Then there's an <code>alternate_names</code> section in the configuration file (you should tune this to suit your taste):</p>\n\n<pre><code>[ alternate_names ]\n\nDNS.1       = example.com\nDNS.2       = www.example.com\nDNS.3       = mail.example.com\nDNS.4       = ftp.example.com\n\n# Add these if you need them. But usually you don't want them or\n#   need them in production. You may need them for development.\n# DNS.5       = localhost\n# DNS.6       = localhost.localdomain\n# DNS.7       = 127.0.0.1\n\n# IPv6 localhost\n# DNS.8     = ::1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Its important to put DNS name in the SAN and not the CN because <em>both</em> the IETF and the CA/Browser Forums specify the practice. They also specify that DNS names in the CN are deprecated (but not prohibited). <em>If</em> you put a DNS name in the CN, then it <em>must</em> be included in the SAN under the CA/B policies. So you can't avoid using the Subject Alternate Name.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't do put DNS names in the SAN, then the certificate will fail to validate under a browser and other user agents which follow the CA/Browser Forum guidelines.</p>\n\n<p>Related: browsers follow the CA/Browser Forum policies; and not the IETF policies. That's one of the reasons a certificate created with OpenSSL (which generally follows the IETF) sometimes does not validate under a Browser (browsers follow the CA/B). They are different standards, they have different issuing policies and different validation requirements.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Create a self signed certificate</strong> (notice the addition of <code>-x509</code> option):</p>\n\n<pre><code>openssl req -config example-com.conf -new -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \\\n    -keyout example-com.key.pem -days 365 -out example-com.cert.pem\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Create a signing request</strong> (notice the lack of <code>-x509</code> option):</p>\n\n<pre><code>openssl req -config example-com.conf -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \\\n    -keyout example-com.key.pem -days 365 -out example-com.req.pem\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Print a self signed certificate</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>openssl x509 -in example-com.cert.pem -text -noout\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Print a signing request</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>openssl req -in example-com.req.pem -text -noout\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Configuration file (passed via <code>-config</code> option)</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>[ req ]\ndefault_bits        = 2048\ndefault_keyfile     = server-key.pem\ndistinguished_name  = subject\nreq_extensions      = req_ext\nx509_extensions     = x509_ext\nstring_mask         = utf8only\n\n# The Subject DN can be formed using X501 or RFC 4514 (see RFC 4519 for a description).\n#   Its sort of a mashup.

(An <em>origin</em> is a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/19542686/710446\">domain, plus a scheme and port number</a>.)  By default, Site B's pages are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy\">not accessible to any other origin</a>; using the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header opens a door for cross-origin access by specific requesting origins.</p>\n\n<p>For each resource/page that Site B wants to make accessible to Site A, Site B should serve its pages with the response header:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://siteA.com\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Modern browsers will not block cross-domain requests outright.  If Site A requests a page from Site B, the browser will actually fetch the requested page <em>on the network level</em> and check if the response headers list Site A as a permitted requester domain.  If Site B has not indicated that Site A is allowed to access this page, the browser will trigger the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>'s <code>error</code> event and  deny the response data to the requesting JavaScript code.</p>\n\n<h1>Non-simple requests</h1>\n\n<p>What happens on the network level can be <em>slightly</em> more complex than explained above. If the request is a <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-handling-a-not-so-simple-request\">\"non-simple\" request</a>, the browser first sends a data-less \"preflight\" OPTIONS request, to verify that the server will accept the request. A request is non-simple when either (or both):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>using an HTTP verb other than GET or POST (e.g. PUT, DELETE)</li>\n<li>using non-simple request headers; the only simple requests headers are:\n<ul>\n<li><code>Accept</code></li>\n<li><code>Accept-Language</code></li>\n<li><code>Content-Language</code></li>\n<li><code>Content-Type</code> (this is only simple when its value is <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>multipart/form-data</code>, or <code>text/plain</code>)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the server responds to the OPTIONS preflight with appropriate response headers (<code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> for non-simple headers, <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> for non-simple verbs) that match the non-simple verb and/or non-simple headers, then the browser sends the actual request.</p>\n\n<p>Supposing that Site A wants to send a PUT request for <code>/somePage</code>, with a non-simple <code>Content-Type</code> value of <code>application/json</code>, the browser would first send a preflight request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OPTIONS /somePage HTTP/1.1\nOrigin: http://siteA.com\nAccess-Control-Request-Method: PUT\nAccess-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code> <code>and Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> are added by the browser automatically; you do not need to add them.

Cross-Domain AJAX request) is an issue that most web developers might encounter, according to Same-Origin-Policy, browsers restrict client JavaScript in a security sandbox, usually JS cannot directly communicate with a remote server from a different domain. In the past developers created many tricky ways to achieve Cross-Domain resource request, most commonly using ways are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use Flash/Silverlight or server side as a \"proxy\" to communicate\nwith remote. </li>\n<li>JSON With Padding (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP\">JSONP</a>). </li>\n<li>Embeds remote server in an iframe and communicate through fragment or window.name, refer <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-crossdomaincomm/#N10120\">here</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Those tricky ways have more or less some issues, for example JSONP might result in security hole if developers simply \"eval\" it, and #3 above, although it works, both domains should build strict contract between each other, it neither flexible nor elegant IMHO:)</p>\n\n<p>W3C had introduced Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) as a standard solution to provide a safe, flexible and a recommended standard way to solve this issue. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The Mechanism</strong></p>\n\n<p>From a high level we can simply deem CORS is a contract between client AJAX call from domain A and a page hosted on domain B, a typical Cross-Origin request/response would be:</p>\n\n<p><strong>DomainA AJAX request headers</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Host DomainB.com\nUser-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0\nAccept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8,application/json\nAccept-Language en-us;\nAccept-Encoding gzip, deflate\nKeep-Alive 115\nOrigin http://DomainA.com \n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>DomainB response headers</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>Cache-Control private\nContent-Type application/json; charset=utf-8\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin DomainA.com\nContent-Length 87\nProxy-Connection Keep-Alive\nConnection Keep-Alive\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The blue parts I marked above were the kernal facts, \"Origin\" request header \"indicates where the cross-origin request or preflight request originates from\", the \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" response header indicates this page allows remote request from DomainA (if the value is * indicate allows remote requests from any domain).</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned above, W3 recommended browser to implement a \"<strong>preflight request</strong>\" before submiting the actually Cross-Origin HTTP request, in a nutshell it is an HTTP <code>OPTIONS</code> request:</p>\n\n<pre><code>OPTIONS DomainB.com/foo.aspx HTTP/1.1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If foo.aspx supports OPTIONS HTTP verb, it might return response like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 01 Mar 2011 15:38:19 GMT\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://DomainA.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With\nAccess-Control-Max-Age: 1728000\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nContent-Type: application/json\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Only if the response contains \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" AND its value is \"*\" or contain the domain who submitted the CORS request, by satisfying this mandtory condition browser will submit the actual Cross-Domain request, and cache the result in \"<strong>Preflight-Result-Cache</strong>\".</p>\n\n<p>I blogged about CORS three years ago: <a href=\"http://wayneye.com/Blog/Ajax-Cross-Origin-HTTP-request\">AJAX Cross-Origin HTTP request</a></p>\n", "title": "How does Access-Control-Allow-Origin header work?", "tags": ["javascript", "cross-domain", "cors"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10636611/how-does-access-control-allow-origin-header-work/21310171#21310171", "question_id": 10636611, "answer_id": 21310171}, {"body": "<p><em>1.

And, when the browser requests MyCode.js, it sends an Origin: header saying \"Origin: <a href=\"http://siteZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://siteZ</a>\", because it can see that you're requesting to siteA and siteZ != siteA.

It means, Only siteB is allowed to do this request.  So your request for MyCode.js from siteZ gets an error instead, and the browser typically gives you nothing.  But if you make your server return A-C-A-O: siteZ instead, you'll get MyCode.js .  Or if it sends '*', that'll work, that'll let everybody in.  Or if the server always sends the string from the Origin: header... but... for security, if you're afraid of hackers, your server should only allow origins on a shortlist, that are allowed to make those requests.</p>\n\n<p>Then, MyCode.js comes from siteA.  When it makes requests to siteB, they are all cross-origin, the browser sends Origin: siteA, and siteB has to take the siteA, recognize it's on the short list of allowed requesters, and send back A-C-A-O: siteA.

JavaScript or jQuery solutions are both acceptable.</p>\n\n<h3>Related: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/840781/easiest-way-to-find-duplicate-values-in-a-javascript-array\">Easiest way to find duplicate values in a JavaScript array</a></h3>\n", "title": "Remove Duplicates from JavaScript Array", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "duplicate-removal"], "answers": [{"body": "<p><strong>Vanilla JS: Remove duplicates using an Object like a Set</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can always try putting it into an object, and then iterating through its keys:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function remove_duplicates(arr) {\n    var obj = {};\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {\n        obj[arr[i]] = true;\n    }\n    arr = [];\n    for (var key in obj) {\n        arr.push(key);\n    }\n    return arr;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Vanilla JS: Remove duplicates by tracking already seen values (order safe)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Or, for an order-safe version, use an object to store all previously seen values, and check values against it before before adding to an array.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function remove_duplicates_safe(arr) {\n    var seen = {};\n    var arr2 = [];\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {\n        if (!(arr[i] in seen)) {\n            arr2.push(arr[i]);\n            seen[arr[i]] = true;\n        }\n    }\n    return arr2;\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Example usage:</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>a = [\"Mike\",\"Matt\",\"Nancy\",\"Adam\",\"Jenny\",\"Nancy\",\"Carl\"];\n\nb = remove_duplicates(a);\n// b:\n// [\"Adam\", \"Carl\", \"Jenny\", \"Matt\", \"Mike\", \"Nancy\"]\n\nc = remove_duplicates_safe(a);\n// c:\n// [\"Mike\", \"Matt\", \"Nancy\", \"Adam\", \"Jenny\", \"Carl\"]\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Remove Duplicates from JavaScript Array", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "duplicate-removal"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicates-from-javascript-array/9229784#9229784", "question_id": 9229645, "answer_id": 9229784}, {"body": "<h2>\"Smart\" but na\u00efve way</h2>\n\n<pre><code>uniqueArray = a.filter(function(item, pos) {\n    return a.indexOf(item) == pos;\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically, we iterate over the array and, for each element, check if the first position of this element in the array is equal to the current position. Obviously, these two positions are different for duplicate elements.</p>\n\n<p>Using the 3rd (\"this array\") parameter of the filter callback we can avoid a closure of the array variable:</p>\n\n<pre><code>uniqueArray = a.filter(function(item, pos, self) {\n    return self.indexOf(item) == pos;\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Although concise, this algorithm is not particularly efficient for large arrays (quadratic time).</p>\n\n<h2>Hashtables to the rescue</h2>\n\n<pre><code>function uniq(a) {\n    var seen = {};\n    return a.filter(function(item) {\n        return seen.hasOwnProperty(item) ? false : (seen[item] = true);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how it's usually done. The idea is to place each element in a hashtable and then check for its presence instantly. This gives us linear time, but has at least two drawbacks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>since hash keys can only be strings in Javascript, this code doesn't distinguish numbers and \"numeric strings\". That is, <code>uniq([1,\"1\"])</code> will return just <code>[1]</code></li>\n<li>for the same reason, all objects will be considered equal: <code>uniq([{foo:1},{foo:2}])</code> will return just <code>[{foo:1}]</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That said, if your arrays contain only primitives and you don't care about types (e.g. it's always numbers), this solution is optimal.</p>\n\n<h2>The best from two worlds</h2>\n\n<p>An universal solution combines both approaches: it uses hash lookups for primitives and linear search for objects.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function uniq(a) {\n    var prims = {\"boolean\":{}, \"number\":{}, \"string\":{}}, objs = [];\n\n    return a.filter(function(item) {\n        var type = typeof item;\n        if(type in prims)\n            return prims[type].hasOwnProperty(item) ? false : (prims[type][item] = true);\n        else\n            return objs.indexOf(item) &gt;= 0 ? false : objs.push(item);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>sort | uniq</h2>\n\n<p>Another option is to sort the array first, and then remove each element equal to the preceding one:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function uniq(a) {\n    return a.sort().filter(function(item, pos, ary) {\n        return !pos || item != ary[pos - 1];\n    })\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, this doesn't work with objects (because all objects are equal for <code>sort</code>), unless a special compare function can be provided. Additionally, this method silently changes the original array as a side effect - not good! However, if your input is already sorted, this is the way to go (just remove <code>sort</code> from the above).</p>\n\n<h2>Unique by...</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes it's desired to uniquify a list based on some criteria other than just equality, for example, to filter out objects that are different, but share some property. This can be done elegantly by passing a callback. This \"key\" callback is applied to each element, and elements with equal \"keys\" are removed. Since <code>key</code> is expected to return a primitive, hash table will work fine here:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function uniqBy(a, key) {\n    var seen = {};\n    return a.filter(function(item) {\n        var k = key(item);\n        return seen.hasOwnProperty(k) ? false : (seen[k] = true);\n    })\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A particularly useful <code>key()</code> is <code>JSON.stringify</code> which will remove objects that are physically different, but \"look\" the same:</p>\n\n<pre><code>a = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [1,2,3]]\nb = uniqBy(a, JSON.stringify)\nconsole.log(b) // [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Libraries</h2>\n\n<p>Both <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/#uniq\">underscore</a> and <a href=\"https://lodash.com/docs#uniq\">Lo-Dash</a> provide <code>uniq</code> methods. Their algorithms are basically similar to the first snippet above and boil down to this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var result = [];\na.forEach(function(item) {\n     if(result.indexOf(item) &lt; 0) {\n         result.push(item);\n     }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is quadratic, but there are nice additional goodies, like wrapping native <code>indexOf</code>, ability to uniqify by a key (<code>iteratee</code> in their parlance), and optimizations for already sorted arrays.</p>\n\n<p>If you're using jQuery and can't stand anything without a dollar before it, it goes like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  $.uniqArray = function(a) {\n        return $.grep(a, function(item, pos) {\n            return $.inArray(item, a) === pos;\n        });\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is, again, a variation of the first snippet.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n<p>Function calls are expensive in Javascript, therefore the above solutions, as concise as they are, are not particularly efficient. For maximal performance, replace <code>filter</code> with a loop and get rid of other function calls:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function uniq_fast(a) {\n    var seen = {};\n    var out = [];\n    var len = a.length;\n    var j = 0;\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\n         var item = a[i];\n         if(seen[item] !== 1) {\n               seen[item] = 1;\n               out[j++] = item;\n         }\n    }\n    return out;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This chunk of ugly code does the same as the snippet #3 above, but an order of magnitude faster:</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"true\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code snippet-currently-hidden\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function uniq(a) {\r\n    var seen = {};\r\n    return a.filter(function(item) {\r\n        return seen.hasOwnProperty(item) ? false : (seen[item] = true);\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction uniq_fast(a) {\r\n    var seen = {};\r\n    var out = [];\r\n    var len = a.length;\r\n    var j = 0;\r\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {\r\n         var item = a[i];\r\n         if(seen[item] !== 1) {\r\n               seen[item] = 1;\r\n               out[j++] = item;\r\n         }\r\n    }\r\n    return out;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/////\r\n\r\nvar r = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],\r\n    a = [],\r\n    LEN = 1000,\r\n    LOOPS = 1000;\r\n\r\nwhile(LEN--)\r\n    a = a.concat(r);\r\n\r\nvar d = new Date();\r\nfor(var i = 0; i &lt; LOOPS; i++)\r\n    uniq(a);\r\ndocument.write('&lt;br&gt;uniq, ms/loop: ' + (new Date() - d)/LOOPS)\r\n\r\nvar d = new Date();\r\nfor(var i = 0; i &lt; LOOPS; i++)\r\n    uniq_fast(a);\r\ndocument.write('&lt;br&gt;uniq_fast, ms/loop: ' + (new Date() - d)/LOOPS)</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<h2>ES6</h2>\n\n<p>ES6 provides the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set\">Set</a> object, which makes things a whole lot easier:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function uniq(a) {\n   return Array.from(new Set(a));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that, unlike in python, ES6 sets are iterated in insertion order, so this code preserves the order of the original array.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you need an array with unique elements, why not use sets right from the beginning?</p>\n", "title": "Remove Duplicates from JavaScript Array", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "duplicate-removal"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicates-from-javascript-array/9229821#9229821", "question_id": 9229645, "answer_id": 9229821}, {"body": "<p>You could also use the <code>Array.unique()</code> method from the <a href=\"http://www.jslab.dk/library/Array.unique\">JavaScript Lab library</a> \u2013 or steal an idea from there.</p>\n\n<p>However, the code there isn\u2019t very well written, since it declares the <code>unique()</code> method as a property of the Array prototype, thus adding it to every Array, breaking the <code>for...in</code> functionality (because a <code>for...in</code> loop will always iterate over the <code>unique</code> variable, too).</p>\n", "title": "Remove Duplicates from JavaScript Array", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "duplicate-removal"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicates-from-javascript-array/9229823#9229823", "question_id": 9229645, "answer_id": 9229823}, {"body": "<p>Quick and dirty using jQuery:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var names = [\"Mike\",\"Matt\",\"Nancy\",\"Adam\",\"Jenny\",\"Nancy\",\"Carl\"];\nvar uniqueNames = [];\n$.each(names, function(i, el){\n    if($.inArray(el, uniqueNames) === -1) uniqueNames.push(el);\n});\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Remove Duplicates from JavaScript Array", "tags": ["javascript", "arrays", "duplicate-removal"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9229645/remove-duplicates-from-javascript-array/9229932#9229932", "question_id": 9229645, "answer_id": 9229932}, {"body": "<h2>Use <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore.js</a></h2>\n\n<p>It's a library with a host of functions for manipulating arrays. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux, and Backbone.js's\n  suspenders.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/#uniq\">_.uniq</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>_.uniq(array, [isSorted], [iterator])</code> <em>Alias:</em> <strong>unique</strong><br>\n  Produces a duplicate-free version of the <strong>array</strong>, using === to test object\n  equality.

How about if we fill the array in size 100 with random numbers 0..9999. Let's now see Map playing at home. This time an Array of 100K items but random number range is 0..100M.

The former can cause serious performance problems as raised by @numan. That is because the event will bubble down through <strong>all</strong> scopes. </p>\n\n<p>However, the latter (using <code>$rootScope.$emit</code> + <code>$rootScope.$on</code>) does <strong>not</strong> suffer from this and can therefore be used as a fast communication channel!</p>\n\n<p>From the angular documentation of <code>$emit</code>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dispatches an event name upwards through the scope hierarchy notifying the registered</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since there is no scope above <code>$rootScope</code>, there is no bubbling happening. It is totally safe to use <code>$rootScope.$emit()</code>/ <code>$rootScope.$on()</code> as an EventBus.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is one gotcha when using it from within Controllers. If you directly bind to <code>$rootScope.$on()</code> from within a controller, you'll have to clean up the binding yourself when  your local <code>$scope</code> gets destroyed. This is because controllers (in contrast to services) can get instantiated multiple times over the lifetime of an application which would result into bindings summing up eventually creating memory leaks all over the place :)</p>\n\n<p>To unregister, just listen on your <code>$scope</code>'s <code>$destroy</code> event and then call the function that was returned by <code>$rootScope.$on</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular\n    .module('MyApp')\n    .controller('MyController', ['$scope', '$rootScope', function MyController($scope, $rootScope) {\n\n            var unbind = $rootScope.$on('someComponent.someCrazyEvent', function(){\n                console.log('foo');\n            });\n\n            $scope.$on('$destroy', unbind);\n        }\n    ]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I would say, that's not really an angular specific thing as it applies to other EventBus implementations as well, that you have to clean up resources.</p>\n\n<p>However, you <em>can</em> make your life easier for those cases. For instance, you could monkey patch <code>$rootScope</code> and give it a <code>$onRootScope</code> that subscribes to events emitted on the <code>$rootScope</code> but also directly cleans up the handler when the local <code>$scope</code> gets destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>The cleanest way to monkey patch the <code>$rootScope</code> to provide such <code>$onRootScope</code> method would be through a decorator (a run block will probably do it just fine as well but pssst, don't tell anybody)</p>\n\n<p>To make sure the <code>$onRootScope</code> property doesn't show up unexpected when enumerating over <code>$scope</code> we use <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> and set <code>enumerable</code> to <code>false</code>. Keep in mind that you might need an ES5 shim.</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular\n    .module('MyApp')\n    .config(['$provide', function($provide){\n        $provide.decorator('$rootScope', ['$delegate', function($delegate){\n\n            Object.defineProperty($delegate.constructor.prototype, '$onRootScope', {\n                value: function(name, listener){\n                    var unsubscribe = $delegate.$on(name, listener);\n                    this.$on('$destroy', unsubscribe);\n\n                    return unsubscribe;\n                },\n                enumerable: false\n            });\n\n\n            return $delegate;\n        }]);\n    }]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With this method in place the controller code from above can be simplified to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular\n    .module('MyApp')\n    .controller('MyController', ['$scope', function MyController($scope) {\n\n            $scope.$onRootScope('someComponent.someCrazyEvent', function(){\n                console.log('foo');\n            });\n        }\n    ]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So as a final outcome of all this I highly advise you to use <code>$rootScope.$emit</code> + <code>$scope.$onRootScope</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, I'm trying to convince the angular team to address the problem within angular core.

Many people take this advice (including Dave Abrahams') beyond the domain it applies to, and simplify it to apply to <em>all</em> <code>std::string</code> parameters -- <em>Always</em> passing <code>std::string</code> by value is not a \"best practice\" for any and all arbitrary parameters and applications because the optimizations these talks/articles focus on apply <em>only to a restricted set of cases</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If you're returning a value, mutating the parameter, or taking the value, then passing by value could save expensive copying and offer syntactical convenience.</p>\n\n<p>As ever, passing by const reference saves much copying <em>when you don't need a copy</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Now to the specific example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However inval is still quite a lot larger than the size of a reference (which is usually implemented as a pointer). This is because a std::string has various components including a pointer into the heap and a member char[] for short string optimization. So it seems to me that passing by reference is still a good idea. Can anyone explain why Herb might have said this?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If stack size is a concern (and assuming this is not inlined/optimized), <code>return_val</code> + <code>inval</code> > <code>return_val</code> -- IOW, peak stack usage can be <em>reduced</em> by passing by value here (note: oversimplification of ABIs). Meanwhile, passing by const reference can disable the optimizations. The primary reason here is not to avoid stack growth, but to ensure the optimization can be performed <em>where it is applicable</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The days of passing by const reference aren't over -- the rules just more complicated than they once were.

Argument <code>bundle</code>s are protected by Android, and hence are guaranteed to be <strong>persistent</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>One way to set this bundle is by using a static <code>newInstance</code> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static YourFragment newInstance (int data) {\n    YourFragment yf = new YourFragment()\n    /* See this code gets executed immediately on your object construction, same as above */\n    Bundle args = new Bundle();\n    args.putInt(\"data\", data);\n    yf.setArguments(args);\n    return yf;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>However, a constructor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public YourFragment(int data) {\n    Bundle args = new Bundle();\n    args.putInt(\"data\", data);\n    setArguments(args);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>can do exactly the same thing as the <code>newInstance</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, this would fail, and is one of the reasons Android wants you to use the <code>newInstance</code> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public YourFragment(int data) {\n    this.data = data; // Don't do this\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As further explaination, here's Android's Fragment Class:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/**\n     * Supply the construction arguments for this fragment.  This can only\n     * be called before the fragment has been attached to its activity; that\n     * is, you should call it immediately after constructing the fragment.  The\n     * arguments supplied here will be retained across fragment destroy and\n     * creation.\n     */\n    public void setArguments(Bundle args) {\n        if (mIndex &gt;= 0) {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Fragment already active\");\n        }\n        mArguments = args;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that Android asks that the arguments be set <strong>only</strong> at construction, and guarantees that these will be retained.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Android doesn't allow using an overloaded constructor for fragments anymore. You must use the <code>newInstance</code> method.</p>\n", "title": "Best practice for instantiating a new Android Fragment", "tags": ["android", "android-fragments"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9245408/best-practice-for-instantiating-a-new-android-fragment/30867846#30867846", "question_id": 9245408, "answer_id": 30867846}, {"body": "<p>Best way to instantiate the fragment is use default <strong>Fragment.instantiate</strong> method or create factory method to instantiate the the fragment\n<br>\nCaution: always create one empty constructor in fragment other while restoring fragment memory will throw run-time exception.</p>\n", "title": "Best practice for instantiating a new Android Fragment", "tags": ["android", "android-fragments"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9245408/best-practice-for-instantiating-a-new-android-fragment/31134616#31134616", "question_id": 9245408, "answer_id": 31134616}, {"body": "<p>Best practice to instance fragments with arguments in android is to have static factory method in your fragment.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static MyFragment newInstance(String name, int age) {\n    Bundle bundle = new Bundle();\n    bundle.putString(\"name\", name);\n    bundle.putInt(\"age\", age);\n\n    MyFragment fragment = new MyFragment();\n    fragment.setArguments(bundle);\n\n    return fragment;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You should avoid setting your fields with the instance of a fragment.

Of course I don't know how Facebook or Twitter justified it, but here is my own thought process for what it's worth. </p>\n\n<p>In the end, I concluded that this practice is not that unsemantic (is that a word?). In fact, besides shortness and the nice association of \"i is for icon,\" I think it's actually the most semantic choice for an icon when a straightforward <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is not practical.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The usage is consistent with the spec.</strong></p>\n\n<p>While it may not be what the W3 mainly had in mind, it seems to me the official spec for <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> could accommodate an icon pretty easily. After all, the reply-arrow symbol is saying \"reply\" in another way. It expresses a technical term that may be unfamiliar to the reader and would be typically italicized. (\"Here at Twitter, this is what we call a <em>reply arrow</em>.\") And it is a term from another language: a symbolic language. </p>\n\n<p>If, instead of the arrow symbol, Twitter used <code>&lt;i&gt;shout out&lt;/i&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;i&gt;[Japanese character for reply]&lt;/i&gt;</code> (on an English page), that would be consistent with the spec. Then why not <code>&lt;i&gt;[reply arrow]&lt;/i&gt;</code>? (I'm talking strictly HTML semantics here, not accessibility, which I'll get to.)</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can see, the only part of the spec explicitly violated by icon usage is the \"span of text\" phrase (when the tag doesn't contain text also). It is clear that the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag is mainly meant for text, but that's a pretty small detail compared with the overall intent of the tag. The important question for this tag is not what format of content it contains, but what the meaning of that content is. </p>\n\n<p>This is especially true when you consider that the line between \"text\" and \"icon\" can be almost nonexistent on websites. Text may look like more like an icon (as in the Japanese example) or an icon may look like text (as in a jpg button that says \"Submit\" or a cat photo with an overlaid caption) or text may be replaced or enhanced with an image via CSS. Text, image - who cares? It's all content. As long as everyone - humans with impairments, browsers with impairments, search engine spiders, and other machines of various kinds can understand that meaning, we've done our job.</p>\n\n<p>So the fact that the writers of the spec didn't think (or choose) to clarify this shouldn't tie our hands from doing what makes sense and is consistent with the spirit of the tag. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag was originally intended to take the user somewhere else, but now it might pop up a lightbox. Big whoop, right? If someone had figured out how to pop up a lightbox on click before the spec caught up, they still should have used the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, not a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, even if it wasn't entirely consistent with the current definition - because it came the closest  and was still consistent with the spirit of the tag (\"something will happen when you click here\"). Same deal with <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> - whatever type of thing you put inside it, or however creatively you use it, it expresses the general idea of an alternate or set-apart term.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag <em>adds</em> semantic meaning to an icon element.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The alternative option to carry an icon class by itself is <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, which of course has no semantic meaning whatsoever. When a machine asks the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> what it contains, it says, \"I dunno. Could be anything.\" But the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag says, \"I contain a different way of saying something than the usual way, or maybe an unfamiliar term.\" That's not the same as \"I contain an icon,\" but it's a lot closer to it than <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> got! </p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Eventually, common usage makes right.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In addition to the above, it's worth considering that machine readers (whether search engine, screen reader, or whatever) may at any time begin to take into account that Facebook, Twitter, and other websites use the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag for icons. They don't care about the spec as much as they care about extracting meaning from code by whatever means necessary. So they might use this knowledge of common usage to simply record that \"there may be an icon here\" or do something more advanced like triggering a look into the CSS for a hint to meaning, or who knows what. So if you choose to use the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for icons on your website, you may be providing more meaning than the spec does.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, if this usage becomes widespread, it will likely be included in the spec in the future. Then you'll be going through your code, replacing <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s with <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>'s! So it may make sense to get on board with what seems to be the direction of the spec, especially when it doesn't clearly conflict with the current spec. Common usage tends to dictate language rules more than the other way around. If you're old enough, do you remember that \"Web site\" was the official spelling when the word was new? Dictionaries insisted there must be a space and Web must be capitalized. There were semantic reasons for that. But common usage said, \"Whatever, that's stupid. I'm using 'website' because it's more concise and looks better.\" And before long, dictionaries officially acknowledged that spelling as correct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. So I'm going ahead and using it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> provides more meaning to machines because of the spec, it provides more meaning to humans because we easily associate \"i\" with \"icon\", <em>and</em> it's only one letter long. Win! And if you make sure to include equivalent text either inside the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag or right next to it (as Twitter does), then screen readers understand where to click to reply, the link is usable if CSS doesn't load, and human readers with good eyesight and a decent browser see a pretty icon. With all this in mind, I don't see the downside. </p>\n", "title": "Should I use &lt;i&gt; tag for icons instead of &lt;span&gt;?", "tags": ["html", "html5", "semantic-markup"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11135261/should-i-use-i-tag-for-icons-instead-of-span/14555422#14555422", "question_id": 11135261, "answer_id": 14555422}, {"body": "<p>I also found this to be useful when i wanted to place an icon with absolute positioning inside a link <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. </p>\n\n<p>I thought about the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag first, but default styling of those tags inside links typically have border styling and/or shadow effects.

Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>In computer science, the time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the string representing the input.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Big O notation</h2>\n\n<p>The time complexity of an algorithm is commonly expressed using big O notation, which excludes coefficients and lower order terms. When expressed this way, the time complexity is said to be described asymptotically, i.e., as the input size goes to infinity. </p>\n\n<p>For example, if the time required by an algorithm on all inputs of size n is at most 5n<sup>3</sup> + 3n, the asymptotic time complexity is O(n<sup>3</sup>). More on that later.</p>\n\n<p>Few more Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 = O(n)</li>\n<li>n = O(n2)</li>\n<li>log(n) = O(n)</li>\n<li>2 n + 1 = O(n)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>3. O(1) Constant Time:</h2>\n\n<p>An algorithm is said to run in constant time if it requires the same amount of time regardless of the input size. </p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>array: accessing any element</li>\n<li>fixed-size stack: push and pop methods</li>\n<li>fixed-size queue: enqueue and dequeue methods</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>4. O(n) Linear Time</h2>\n\n<p>An algorithm is said to run in linear time if its time execution is directly proportional to the input size, i.e. time grows linearly as input size increases.</p>\n\n<p>Consider the following examples, below I am linearly searching for an element, this has a time complexity of O(n).</p>\n\n<pre><code>int find = 66;\nvar numbers = new int[] { 33, 435, 36, 37, 43, 45, 66, 656, 2232 };\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; numbers.Length - 1; i++)\n{\n    if(find == numbers[i])\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>More Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Array: Linear Search, Traversing, Find minimum etc</li>\n<li>ArrayList: contains method </li>\n<li>Queue: contains method</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>5. O(log n) Logarithmic Time:</h2>\n\n<p>An algorithm is said to run in logarithmic time if its time execution is proportional to the logarithm of the input size.</p>\n\n<p>Example: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search\">Binary Search</a></p>\n\n<p>Recall the \"twenty questions\" game - the task is to guess the value of a hidden number in an interval. Each time you make a guess, you are told whether your guess is too high or too low. Twenty questions game implies a strategy that uses your guess number to halve the interval size. This is an example of the general problem-solving method known as binary search</p>\n\n<h2>6. O(n2) Quadratic Time</h2>\n\n<p>An algorithm is said to run in quadratic time if its time execution is proportional to the square of the input size. </p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort\">Bubble Sort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort\">Selection Sort</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_Sort\">Insertion Sort</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>7.

Thus, its big oh is still constant T(n) = O(1).</p>\n\n<p>3 - Looping (for, while, repeat): Running time for this statement is the number of looping multiplied by the number of operations inside that looping.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>total = 0;                                  // 1\nfor i = 1 to n do begin                     // (1+1)*n = 2n\n      total = total + i;                    // (1+1)*n = 2n\nend;\nwriteln(total);                             // 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, its complexity is T(n) = 1+4n+1 = 4n + 2. Thus, T(n) = O(n).</p>\n\n<p>4 - Nested Loop (looping inside looping): Since there is at least one looping inside the main looping, running time of this statement used O(n^2) or O(n^3).</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>for i = 1 to n do begin                     // (1+1)*n  = 2n\n   for j = 1 to n do begin                  // (1+1)n*n = 2n^2\n       x = x + 1;                           // (1+1)n*n = 2n^2\n       print(x);                            // (n*n)    = n^2\n   end;\nend;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Common Running Time</h2>\n\n<p>There are some common running times when analyzing an algorithm:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>O(1) \u2013 Constant Time\nConstant time means the running time is constant, it\u2019s <em>not affected by the input size</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>O(n) \u2013 Linear Time\nWhen an algorithm accepts n input size, it would perform n operations as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>O(log n) \u2013 Logarithmic Time\nAlgorithm that has running time O(log n) is slight faster than O(n).

As the number of attendees <code>N</code> increases, the time/work it will take you to shake everyone's hand increases as <code>O(N)</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why <code>O(N)</code> and not <code>cN</code>?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There's variation in the amount of time it takes to shake hands with people. You could average this out and capture it in a constant <code>c</code>. But the fundamental operation here --- shaking hands with everyone --- would always be proportional to <code>O(N)</code>, no matter what <code>c</code> was. When debating whether we should go to a cocktail party, we're often more interested in the fact that we'll have to meet everyone than in the minute details of what those meetings look like.</p>\n\n<p><strong>O(N^2)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The host of the cocktail party wants you to play a silly game where everyone meets everyone else. Therefore, you must meet <code>N-1</code> other people and, because the next person has already met you, they must meet <code>N-2</code> people, and so on. The sum of this series is <code>x^2/2+x/2</code>. As the number of attendees grows, the <code>x^2</code> term gets big <em>fast</em>, so we just drop everything else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>O(N^3)</strong></p>\n\n<p>You have to meet everyone else and, during each meeting, you must talk about everyone else in the room.</p>\n\n<p><strong>O(1)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The host wants to announce something. They ding a wineglass and speak loudly. Everyone hears them. It turns out it doesn't matter how many attendees there are, this operation always takes the same amount of time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>O(log N)</strong></p>\n\n<p>The host has laid everyone out at the table in alphabetical order. Where is Dan? You reason that he must be somewhere between Adam and Mandy (certainly not between Mandy and Zach!). Given that, is he between George and Mandy? No. He must be between Adam and Fred, and between Cindy and Fred. And so on... we can efficiently locate Dan by looking at half the set and then half of that set. Ultimately, we look at <strong>O(log_2 N)</strong> individuals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>O(N log N)</strong></p>\n\n<p>You could find where to sit down at the table using the algorithm above. If a large number of people came to the table, one at a time, and all did this, that would take <strong>O(N log N)</strong> time. This turns out to be how long it takes to sort any collection of items when they must be compared.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Best/Worst Case</strong></p>\n\n<p>You arrive at the party and need to find Inigo - how long will it take? It depends on when you arrive. If everyone is milling around you've hit the worst-case: it will take <code>O(N)</code> time. However, if everyone is sitting down at the table, it will take only <code>O(log N)</code> time. Or maybe you can leverage the host's wineglass-shouting power and it will take only <code>O(1)</code> time.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming the host is unavailable, we can say that the Inigo-finding algorithm has a lower-bound of <code>O(log N)</code> and an upper-bound of <code>O(N)</code>, depending on the state of the party when you arrive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Space &amp; Communication</strong></p>\n\n<p>The same ideas can be applied to understanding how algorithms use space or communication.</p>\n\n<p>Knuth has written a nice paper about the former entitled <a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/arvindn/misc/knuth_song_complexity.pdf\">\"The Complexity of Songs\"</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Theorem 2: There exist arbitrarily long songs of complexity O(1).</p>\n  \n  <p>PROOF: (due to Casey and the Sunshine Band).

(Note that you can't use visibility: hidden, because a truly invisible element is unclickable, too, and we need the  to remain clickable)</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "Twitter Bootstrap Form File Element upload button", "tags": ["forms", "twitter-bootstrap", "css3"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11235206/twitter-bootstrap-form-file-element-upload-button/11235385#11235385", "question_id": 11235206, "answer_id": 11235385}, {"body": "<p>It's included in Jasny's fork of bootstrap.</p>\n\n<p>A simple upload button can be created using</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;span class=\"btn btn-file\"&gt;Upload&lt;input type=\"file\" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>With the fileupload plugin you can create more advanced widgets.

The just-in-time compiler consults a table with internally implemented methods and compiles the call to the C++ function directly.</p>\n\n<p>Having a look at the code requires the source code for the CLR. You can get that from the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=4917\">SSCLI20 distribution</a>. It was written around the .NET 2.0 time frame, I've found the low-level implementations, like <code>Math.Pow()</code> to be still largely accurate for later versions of the CLR.</p>\n\n<p>The lookup table is located in clr/src/vm/ecall.cpp. The section that's relevant to <code>Math.Pow()</code> looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>FCFuncStart(gMathFuncs)\n    FCIntrinsic(\"Sin\", COMDouble::Sin, CORINFO_INTRINSIC_Sin)\n    FCIntrinsic(\"Cos\", COMDouble::Cos, CORINFO_INTRINSIC_Cos)\n    FCIntrinsic(\"Sqrt\", COMDouble::Sqrt, CORINFO_INTRINSIC_Sqrt)\n    FCIntrinsic(\"Round\", COMDouble::Round, CORINFO_INTRINSIC_Round)\n    FCIntrinsicSig(\"Abs\", &amp;gsig_SM_Flt_RetFlt, COMDouble::AbsFlt, CORINFO_INTRINSIC_Abs)\n    FCIntrinsicSig(\"Abs\", &amp;gsig_SM_Dbl_RetDbl, COMDouble::AbsDbl, CORINFO_INTRINSIC_Abs)\n    FCFuncElement(\"Exp\", COMDouble::Exp)\n    FCFuncElement(\"Pow\", COMDouble::Pow)\n    // etc..\nFCFuncEnd()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Searching for \"COMDouble\" takes you to clr/src/classlibnative/float/comfloat.cpp. I'll spare you the code, just have a look for yourself. It basically checks for corner cases, then calls the CRT's version of <code>pow()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The only other implementation detail that's interesting is the FCIntrinsic macro in the table. That's a hint that the jitter may implement the function as an intrinsic. In other words, substitute the function call with a floating point machine code instruction. Which is not the case for <code>Pow()</code>, there is no FPU instruction for it. But certainly for the other simple operations. Notable is that this can make floating point math in C# substantially faster than the same code in C++, check <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/686483/c-sharp-vs-c-big-performance-difference/687741#687741\">this answer</a> for the reason why.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, the source code for the CRT is also available if you have the full version of Visual Studio vc/crt/src directory. You'll hit the wall on <code>pow()</code> though, Microsoft purchased that code from Intel. Doing a better job than the Intel engineers is unlikely.  Although my high-school book's identity was twice as fast when I tried it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static double FasterPow(double x, double y) {\n    return Math.Exp(y * Math.Log(x));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But not a true substitute because it accumulates error from 3 floating point operations and doesn't deal with the weirdo domain problems that Pow() has.
