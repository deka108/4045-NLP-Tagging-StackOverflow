Views are (declarative) HTML that contain AngularJS <strong>directives</strong>. Directives set up the event handlers behind the scenes for us and give us dynamic databinding. Selectors are rarely used, so the need for IDs (and some types of classes) is greatly diminished. Views are tied to <strong>models</strong> (via scopes). Views are a projection of the model.

Don't design your page, and then change it with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model\">DOM</a> manipulations</h1>\n\n<p>In jQuery, you design a page, and then you make it dynamic. This is because jQuery was designed for augmentation and has grown incredibly from that simple premise.</p>\n\n<p>But in AngularJS, you must start from the ground up with your architecture in mind. Instead of starting by thinking \"I have this piece of the DOM and I want to make it do X\", you have to start with what you want to accomplish, then go about designing your application, and then finally go about designing your view.</p>\n\n<h1>2. Don't augment jQuery with AngularJS</h1>\n\n<p>Similarly, don't start with the idea that jQuery does X, Y, and Z, so I'll just add AngularJS on top of that for models and controllers. This is <em>really</em> tempting when you're just starting out, which is why I always recommend that new AngularJS developers don't use jQuery at all, at least until they get used to doing things the \"Angular Way\".</p>\n\n<p>I've seen many developers here and on the mailing list create these elaborate solutions with jQuery plugins of 150 or 200 lines of code that they then glue into AngularJS with a collection of callbacks and <code>$apply</code>s that are confusing and convoluted; but they eventually get it working! The problem is that in <strong>most</strong> cases that jQuery plugin could be rewritten in AngularJS in a fraction of the code, where suddenly everything becomes comprehensible and straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is this: when solutioning, first \"think in AngularJS\"; if you can't think of a solution, ask the community; if after all of that there is no easy solution, <em>then</em> feel free to reach for the jQuery. But don't let jQuery become a crutch or you'll never master AngularJS.</p>\n\n<h1>3. Always think in terms of architecture</h1>\n\n<p>First know that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application\">single-page applications</a> are <em>applications</em>. They're <em>not</em> webpages. So we need to think like a server-side developer <em>in addition</em> to thinking like a client-side developer. We have to think about how to divide our application into individual, extensible, testable components.</p>\n\n<p>So then <em>how</em> do you do that? How do you \"think in AngularJS\"? Here are some general principles, contrasted with jQuery.</p>\n\n<h2>The view is the \"official record\"</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery, we programmatically change the view. We could have a dropdown menu defined as a <code>ul</code> like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"main-menu\"&gt;\n    &lt;li class=\"active\"&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#/home\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#/menu1\"&gt;Menu 1&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#/sm1\"&gt;Submenu 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#/sm2\"&gt;Submenu 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"#/sm3\"&gt;Submenu 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;\n        &lt;a href=\"#/home\"&gt;Menu 2&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In jQuery, in our application logic, we would activate it with something like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$('.main-menu').dropdownMenu();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When we just look at the view, it's not immediately obvious that there is any functionality here. For small applications, that's fine. But for non-trivial applications, things quickly get confusing and hard to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, though, the view is the official record of view-based functionality. Our <code>ul</code> declaration would look like this instead:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"main-menu\" dropdown-menu&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These two do the same thing, but in the AngularJS version anyone looking at the template knows what's supposed to happen. Whenever a new member of the development team comes on board, she can look at this and then <em>know</em> that there is a directive called <code>dropdownMenu</code> operating on it; she doesn't need to intuit the right answer or sift through any code. The view told us what was supposed to happen. Much cleaner.</p>\n\n<p>Developers new to AngularJS often ask a question like: how do I find all links of a specific kind and add a directive onto them. The developer is always flabbergasted when we reply: you don't. But the reason you don't do that is that this is like half-jQuery, half-AngularJS, and no good. The problem here is that the developer is trying to \"do jQuery\" in the context of AngularJS. That's never going to work well. The view <em>is</em> the official record. Outside of a directive (more on this below), you never, ever, <em>never</em> change the DOM. And directives are applied <em>in the view</em>, so intent is clear.</p>\n\n<p>Remember: don't design, and then mark up. You must architect, and then design.</p>\n\n<h2>Data binding</h2>\n\n<p>This is by far one of the most awesome features of AngularJS and cuts out a lot of the need to do the kinds of DOM manipulations I mentioned in the previous section. AngularJS will automatically update your view so you don't have to! In jQuery, we respond to events and then update content. Something like:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$.ajax({\n  url: '/myEndpoint.json',\n  success: function ( data, status ) {\n    $('ul#log').append('&lt;li&gt;Data Received!&lt;/li&gt;');\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For a view that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"messages\" id=\"log\"&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Apart from mixing concerns, we also have the same problems of signifying intent that I mentioned before. But more importantly, we had to manually reference and update a DOM node. And if we want to delete a log entry, we have to code against the DOM for that too. How do we test the logic apart from the DOM? And what if we want to change the presentation?</p>\n\n<p>This a little messy and a trifle frail. But in AngularJS, we can do this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$http( '/myEndpoint.json' ).then( function ( response ) {\n    $scope.log.push( { msg: 'Data Received!' } );\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And our view can look like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;ul class=\"messages\"&gt;\n    &lt;li ng-repeat=\"entry in log\"&gt;{{ entry.msg }}&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But for that matter, our view could look like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;div class=\"messages\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"alert\" ng-repeat=\"entry in log\"&gt;\n        {{ entry.msg }}\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now instead of using an unordered list, we're using Bootstrap alert boxes. And we never had to change the controller code! But more importantly, no matter <em>where</em> or <em>how</em> the log gets updated, the view will change too. Automatically. Neat!</p>\n\n<p>Though I didn't show it here, the data binding is two-way. So those log messages could also be editable in the view just by doing this: <code>&lt;input ng-model=\"entry.msg\" /&gt;</code>. And there was much rejoicing.</p>\n\n<h2>Distinct model layer</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery, the DOM is kind of like the model. But in AngularJS, we have a separate model layer that we can manage in any way we want, completely independently from the view. This helps for the above data binding, maintains <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">separation of concerns</a>, and introduces far greater testability. Other answers mentioned this point, so I'll just leave it at that.</p>\n\n<h2>Separation of concerns</h2>\n\n<p>And all of the above tie into this over-arching theme: keep your concerns separate. Your view acts as the official record of what is supposed to happen (for the most part); your model represents your data; you have a service layer to perform reusable tasks; you do DOM manipulation and augment your view with directives; and you glue it all together with controllers. This was also mentioned in other answers, and the only thing I would add pertains to testability, which I discuss in another section below.</p>\n\n<h2>Dependency injection</h2>\n\n<p>To help us out with separation of concerns is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\">dependency injection</a> (DI). If you come from a server-side language (from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29\">Java</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP\">PHP</a>) you're probably familiar with this concept already, but if you're a client-side guy coming from jQuery, this concept can seem anything from silly to superfluous to hipster. But it's not. :-)</p>\n\n<p>From a broad perspective, DI means that you can declare components very freely and then from any other component, just ask for an instance of it and it will be granted. You don't have to know about loading order, or file locations, or anything like that. The power may not immediately be visible, but I'll provide just one (common) example: testing.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say in our application, we require a service that implements server-side storage through a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer\">REST</a> API and, depending on application state, local storage as well. When running tests on our controllers, we don't want to have to communicate with the server - we're testing the <em>controller</em>, after all. We can just add a mock service of the same name as our original component, and the injector will ensure that our controller gets the fake one automatically - our controller doesn't and needn't know the difference.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of testing...</p>\n\n<h1>4. Test-driven development - <em>always</em></h1>\n\n<p>This is really part of section 3 on architecture, but it's so important that I'm putting it as its own top-level section.</p>\n\n<p>Out of all of the many jQuery plugins you've seen, used, or written, how many of them had an accompanying test suite? Not very many because jQuery isn't very amenable to that. But AngularJS is.</p>\n\n<p>In jQuery, the only way to test is often to create the component independently with a sample/demo page against which our tests can perform DOM manipulation. So then we have to develop a component separately and <em>then</em> integrate it into our application. How inconvenient! So much of the time, when developing with jQuery, we opt for iterative instead of test-driven development. And who could blame us?</p>\n\n<p>But because we have separation of concerns, we can do test-driven development iteratively in AngularJS! For example, let's say we want a super-simple directive to indicate in our menu what our current route is. We can declare what we want in the view of our application:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;a href=\"/hello\" when-active&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Okay, now we can write a test for the non-existent <code>when-active</code> directive:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>it( 'should add \"active\" when the route changes', inject(function() {\n    var elm = $compile( '&lt;a href=\"/hello\" when-active&gt;Hello&lt;/a&gt;' )( $scope );\n\n    $location.path('/not-matching');\n    expect( elm.hasClass('active') ).toBeFalsey();\n\n    $location.path( '/hello' );\n    expect( elm.hasClass('active') ).toBeTruthy();\n}));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And when we run our test, we can confirm that it fails. Only now should we create our directive:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>.directive( 'whenActive', function ( $location ) {\n    return {\n        scope: true,\n        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {\n            scope.$on( '$routeChangeSuccess', function () {\n                if ( $location.path() == element.attr( 'href' ) ) {\n                    element.addClass( 'active' );\n                }\n                else {\n                    element.removeClass( 'active' );\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Our test now passes <em>and</em> our menu performs as requested. Our development is <em>both</em> iterative <em>and</em> test-driven. Wicked-cool.</p>\n\n<h1>5. Conceptually, directives are <em>not</em> packaged jQuery</h1>\n\n<p>You'll often hear \"only do DOM manipulation in a directive\". <strong>This is a necessity.</strong> Treat it with due deference!</p>\n\n<p>But let's dive a little deeper...</p>\n\n<p>Some directives just decorate what's already in the view (think <code>ngClass</code>) and therefore sometimes do DOM manipulation straight away and then are basically done. But if a directive is like a \"widget\" and has a template, it should <em>also</em> respect separation of concerns. That is, the template <em>too</em> should remain largely independent from its implementation in the link and controller functions.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS comes with an entire set of tools to make this very easy; with <code>ngClass</code> we can dynamically update the class; <code>ngModel</code> allows two-way data binding; <code>ngShow</code> and <code>ngHide</code> programmatically show or hide an element; and many more - including the ones we write ourselves. In other words, we can do all kinds of awesomeness <em>without</em> DOM manipulation. The less DOM manipulation, the easier directives are to test, the easier they are to style, the easier they are to change in the future, and the more re-usable and distributable they are.</p>\n\n<p>I see lots of developers new to AngularJS using directives as the place to throw a bunch of jQuery. In other words, they think \"since I can't do DOM manipulation in the controller, I'll take that code put it in a directive\". While that certainly is much better, it's often <em>still wrong</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Think of the logger we programmed in section 3. Even if we put that in a directive, we <em>still</em> want to do it the \"Angular Way\". It <em>still</em> doesn't take any DOM manipulation! There are lots of times when DOM manipulation is necessary, but it's a <em>lot</em> rarer than you think! Before doing DOM manipulation <em>anywhere</em> in your application, ask yourself if you really need to. There might be a better way.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a quick example that shows the pattern I see most frequently. We want a toggleable button. (Note: this example is a little contrived and a skosh verbose to represent more complicated cases that are solved in exactly the same way.)</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>.directive( 'myDirective', function () {\n    return {\n        template: '&lt;a class=\"btn\"&gt;Toggle me!&lt;/a&gt;',\n        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {\n            var on = false;\n\n            $(element).click( function () {\n                on = !on;\n                $(element).toggleClass('active', on);\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are a few things wrong with this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First, jQuery was never necessary. There's nothing we did here that needed jQuery at all!</li>\n<li>Second, even if we already have jQuery on our page, there's no reason to use it here; we can simply use <code>angular.element</code> and our component will still work when dropped into a project that doesn't have jQuery.</li>\n<li>Third, even assuming jQuery <em>was</em> required for this directive to work, jqLite (<code>angular.element</code>) will <em>always</em> use jQuery if it was loaded! So we needn't use the <code>$</code> - we can just use <code>angular.element</code>.</li>\n<li>Fourth, closely related to the third, is that jqLite elements needn't be wrapped in <code>$</code> - the <code>element</code> that is passed to the <code>link</code> function would <em>already be</em> a jQuery element! </li>\n<li>And fifth, which we've mentioned in previous sections, why are we mixing template stuff into our logic?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This directive can be rewritten (even for very complicated cases!) much more simply like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>.directive( 'myDirective', function () {\n    return {\n        scope: true,\n        template: '&lt;a class=\"btn\" ng-class=\"{active: on}\" ng-click=\"toggle()\"&gt;Toggle me!&lt;/a&gt;',\n        link: function ( scope, element, attrs ) {\n            scope.on = false;\n\n            scope.toggle = function () {\n                scope.on = !scope.on;\n            };\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again, the template stuff is in the template, so you (or your users) can easily swap it out for one that meets any style necessary, and the <strong>logic</strong> never had to be touched. Reusability - boom!</p>\n\n<p>And there are still all those other benefits, like testing - it's easy! No matter what's in the template, the directive's internal API is never touched, so refactoring is easy. You can change the template as much as you want without touching the directive. And no matter what you change, your tests still pass.</p>\n\n<p>w00t!</p>\n\n<p>So if directives aren't just collections of jQuery-like functions, what are they? Directives are actually <strong>extensions of HTML</strong>. If HTML doesn't do something you need it to do, you write a directive to do it for you, and then use it just as if it was part of HTML.</p>\n\n<p>Put another way, if AngularJS doesn't do something out of the box, think how the team would accomplish it to fit right in with <code>ngClick</code>, <code>ngClass</code>, et al.</p>\n\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n\n<p>Don't even use jQuery. Don't even include it. It will hold you back. And when you come to a problem that you think you know how to solve in jQuery already, before you reach for the <code>$</code>, try to think about how to do it within the confines the AngularJS. If you don't know, ask! 19 times out of 20, the best way to do it doesn't need jQuery and to try to solve it with jQuery results in more work for you.</p>\n", "title": "&quot;Thinking in AngularJS&quot; if I have a jQuery background?", "answer_id": 15012542, "question_id": 14994391, "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "angularjs", "design"]}, {"body": "<p>They're apples and oranges.

So, I guess my answer to this question would essentially boil down to, \"think like someone who never learned jQuery\" and avoid any temptation to incorporate jQuery directly (obviously AngularJS uses it to some extent behind the scenes).</p>\n", "title": "&quot;Thinking in AngularJS&quot; if I have a jQuery background?", "answer_id": 18775818, "question_id": 14994391, "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "angularjs", "design"]}, {"body": "<p>jQuery is a DOM manipulation library.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS is an MV* framework.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, AngularJS is one of the few JavaScript MV* frameworks (many JavaScript MVC tools still fall under the category library).</p>\n\n<p>Being a framework, it hosts your code and takes ownership of decisions about what to call and when!</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS itself includes a jQuery-lite edition within it.

FIND' where in the DOM you want to place this data, the '2. UPDATE/APPEND' it there by creating a new node or just setting its <a href=\"http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascript-innerHTML.php\">innerHTML</a>. Then when you want to update this view, you then '3. FIND' the location and '4. UPDATE'. This cycle of find and update all done within the same context of getting and formatting data from server is gone in AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>With AngularJS you have your model (JavaScript objects you are already used to) and the value of the model tells you about the model (obviously) and about the view, and an operation on the model automatically propagates to the view, so you don't have to think about it. You will find yourself in AngularJS no longer finding things in the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>To put in another way, in jQuery, you need to think about CSS selectors, that is, where is the <code>div</code> or <code>td</code> that has a class or attribute, etc., so that I can get their HTML or color or value, but in AngularJS, you will find yourself thinking like this: what model am I dealing with, I will set the model's value to true. You are not bothering yourself of whether the view reflecting this value is a checked box or resides in a <code>td</code> element (details you would have often needed to think about in jQuery).</p>\n\n<p>And with DOM manipulation in AngularJS, you find yourself adding directives and filters, which you can think of as valid HTML extensions.</p>\n\n<p>One more thing you will experience in AngularJS: in jQuery you call the jQuery functions a lot, in AngularJS, AngularJS will call your functions, so AngularJS will 'tell you how to do things', but the benefits are worth it, so learning AngularJS usually means learning what AngularJS wants or the way AngularJS requires that you present your functions and it will call it accordingly.

If you're coming from jQuery you may find some of the differences surprising. Angular may make you angry.</p>\n\n<p>This is normal, you should push through. Angular is worth it.</p>\n\n<h2>The big difference (TLDR)</h2>\n\n<p>jQuery gives you a toolkit for selecting arbitrary bits of the DOM and making ad-hoc changes to them. You can do pretty much anything you like piece by piece.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS instead gives you a <strong>compiler</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>What this means is that AngularJS reads your entire DOM from top to bottom and treats it as code, literally as instructions to the compiler. As it traverses the DOM, It looks for specific <strong>directives</strong> (compiler directives) that tell the AngularJS compiler how to behave and what to do. Directives are little objects full of JavaScript which can match against attributes, tags, classes or even comments. </p>\n\n<p>When the Angular compiler determines that a piece of the DOM matches a particular directive, it calls the directive function, passing it the DOM element, any attributes, the current $scope (which is a local variable store), and some other useful bits. These attributes may contain expressions which can be interpreted by the Directive, and which tell it how to render, and when it should redraw itself.</p>\n\n<p>Directives can then in turn pull in additional Angular components such as controllers, services, etc. What comes out the bottom of the compiler is a fully formed web application, wired up and ready to go.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This means that Angular is Template Driven</strong>. Your template drives the JavaScript, not the other way around. This is a radical reversal of roles, and the complete opposite of the unobtrusive JavaScript we have been writing for the last 10 years or so. This can take some getting used to.</p>\n\n<p>If this sounds like it might be over-prescriptive and limiting, nothing could be farther from the truth. Because AngularJS treats your HTML as code, you get <strong>HTML level granularity in your web application</strong>. Everything is possible, and most things are surprisingly easy once you make a few conceptual leaps.</p>\n\n<p>Let's get down to the nitty gritty.</p>\n\n<h2>First up, Angular doesn't replace jQuery</h2>\n\n<p>Angular and jQuery do different things. AngularJS gives you a set of tools to produce web applications. jQuery mainly gives you tools for modifying the DOM. If jQuery is present on your page, AngularJS will use it automatically. If it isn't, AngularJS ships with jQuery Lite, which is a cut down, but still perfectly usable version of jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>Misko likes jQuery and doesn't object to you using it. However you will find as you advance that you can get a pretty much all of your work done using a combination of scope, templates and directives, and you should prefer this workflow where possible because your code will be more discrete, more configurable, and more Angular.</p>\n\n<p>If you do use jQuery, you shouldn't be sprinkling it all over the place. The correct place for DOM manipulation in AngularJS is in a directive. More on these later.</p>\n\n<h2>Unobtrusive JavaScript with Selectors vs. Declarative Templates</h2>\n\n<p>jQuery is typically applied unobtrusively. Your JavaScript code is linked in the header (or the footer), and this is the only place it is mentioned. We use selectors to pick out bits of the page and write plugins to modify those parts.</p>\n\n<p>The JavaScript is in control. The HTML has a completely independent existence. Your HTML remains semantic even without JavaScript. Onclick attributes are very bad practice.</p>\n\n<p>One of the first things your will notice about AngularJS is that <strong>custom attributes are everywhere</strong>. Your HTML will be littered with ng attributes, which are essentially onClick attributes on steroids. These are directives (compiler directives), and are one of the main ways in which the template is hooked to the model.</p>\n\n<p>When you first see this you might be tempted to write AngularJS off as old school intrusive JavaScript (like I did at first). In fact, AngularJS does not play by those rules. In AngularJS, your HTML5 is a template. It is compiled by AngularJS to produce your web page.</p>\n\n<p>This is the first big difference. To jQuery, your web page is a DOM to be manipulated. To AngularJS, your HTML is code to be compiled. AngularJS reads in your whole web page and literally compiles it into a new web page using its built in compiler.</p>\n\n<p>Your template should be declarative; its meaning should be clear simply by reading it. We use custom attributes with meaningful names. We make up new HTML elements, again with meaningful names. A designer with minimal HTML knowledge and no coding skill can read your AngularJS template and understand what it is doing. He or she can make modifications. <em>This is the Angular way.</em></p>\n\n<h2>The template is in the driving seat.</h2>\n\n<p>One of the first questions I asked myself when starting AngularJS and running through the tutorials is <strong>\"Where is my code?\"</strong>. I've written no JavaScript, and yet I have all this behaviour. The answer is obvious. Because AngularJS compiles the DOM, AngularJS is treating your HTML as code. For many simple cases it's often sufficient to just write a template and let AngularJS compile it into an application for you.</p>\n\n<p>Your template drives your application. It's treated as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language\">DSL</a>. You write AngularJS components, and AngularJS will take care of pulling them in and making them available at the right time based on the structure of your template. This is very different to a standard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\">MVC</a> pattern, where the template is just for output.</p>\n\n<p>It's more similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT\">XSLT</a> than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails\">Ruby on Rails</a> for example.</p>\n\n<p>This is a radical inversion of control that takes some getting used to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stop trying to drive your application from your JavaScript. Let the template drive the application, and let AngularJS take care of wiring the components together. This also is the Angular way.</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Semantic HTML vs. Semantic Models</h2>\n\n<p>With jQuery your HTML page should contain semantic meaningful content. If the JavaScript is turned off (by a user or search engine) your content remains accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Because AngularJS treats your HTML page as a template. The template is not supposed to be semantic as your content is typically stored in your model which ultimately comes from your API. AngularJS compiles your DOM with the model to produce a semantic web page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Your HTML source is no longer semantic, instead, your API and compiled DOM are semantic.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, meaning lives in the model, the HTML is just a template, for display only.</p>\n\n<p>At this point you likely have all sorts of questions concerning <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\">SEO</a> and accessibility, and rightly so. There are open issues here. Most screen readers will now parse JavaScript. Search engines can also index <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29\">AJAXed</a> content. Nevertheless, you will want to make sure you are using pushstate URLs and you have a decent sitemap. See here for a discussion of the issue: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/23245379/687677\">http://stackoverflow.com/a/23245379/687677</a></p>\n\n<h2>Separation of concerns (SOC) vs. MVC</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">Separation of concerns</a> (SOC) is a pattern that grew up over many years of web development for a variety of reasons including SEO, accessibility and browser incompatibility. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>HTML - Semantic meaning. The HTML should stand alone.</li>\n<li>CSS - Styling, without the CSS the page is still readable.</li>\n<li>JavaScript - Behaviour, without the script the content remains.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, AngularJS does not play by their rules. In a stroke, <strong>AngularJS does away with a decade of received wisdom</strong> and instead implements an MVC pattern in which the template is no longer semantic, not even a little bit.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Model - your models contains your semantic data. Models are usually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON\">JSON</a> objects. Models exist as attributes of an object called $scope. You can also store handy utility functions on $scope which your templates can then access.</li>\n<li>View - Your views are written in HTML. The view is usually not semantic because your data lives in the model.</li>\n<li>Controller - Your controller is a JavaScript function which hooks the view to the model. Its function is to initialise $scope. Depending on your application, you may or may not need to create a controller. You can have many controllers on a page.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>MVC and SOC are not on opposite ends of the same scale, they are on completely different axes. SOC makes no sense in an AngularJS context. You have to forget it and move on.</p>\n\n<p>If, like me, you lived through the browser wars, you might find this idea quite offensive. Get over it, it'll be worth it, I promise.</p>\n\n<h2>Plugins vs. Directives</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Plugins extend jQuery. AngularJS Directives extend the capabilities of your browser.</strong></p>\n\n<p>In jQuery we define plugins by adding functions to the jQuery.prototype. We then hook these into the DOM by selecting elements and calling the plugin on the result. The idea is to extend the capabilities of jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you want a carousel on your page, you might define an unordered list of figures, perhaps wrapped in a nav element. You might then write some jQuery to select the list on the page and restyle it as a gallery with timeouts to do the sliding animation.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, we define directives. A directive is a function which returns a JSON object. This object tells AngularJS what DOM elements to look for, and what changes to make to them. Directives are hooked in to the template using either attributes or elements, which you invent. The idea is to extend the capabilities of HTML with new attributes and elements.</p>\n\n<p><em>The AngularJS way is to extend the capabilities of native looking HTML.</em> You should write HTML that looks like HTML, extended with custom attributes and elements.</p>\n\n<p>If you want a carousel, just use a <code>&lt;carousel /&gt;</code> element, then define a directive to pull in a template, and make that sucker work.</p>\n\n<h2>Lots of small directives vs. big plugins with configuration switches</h2>\n\n<p>The tendency with jQuery is to write great big plugins like lightbox which we then configure by passing in numerous values and options.</p>\n\n<p>This is a mistake in AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>Take the example of a dropdown. When writing a dropdown plugin you might be tempted to code in click handlers, perhaps a function to add in a chevron which is either up or down, perhaps change the class of the unfolded element, show hide the menu, all helpful stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Until you want to make a small change.</p>\n\n<p>Say you have a menu that you want to unfold on hover. Well now we have a problem. Our plugin has wired in our click handler for us, we're going to need to add a configuration option to make it behave differently in this specific case.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS we write smaller directives. Our dropdown directive would be ridiculously small. It might maintain the folded state, and provide methods to fold(), unfold() or toggle(). These methods would simply update $scope.menu.visible which is a boolean holding the state.</p>\n\n<p>Now <strong>in our template</strong> we can wire this up:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a ng-click=\"toggle()\"&gt;Menu&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;ul ng-show=\"menu.visible\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Need to update on mouseover?</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;a ng-mouseenter=\"unfold()\" ng-mouseleave=\"fold()\"&gt;Menu&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;ul ng-show=\"menu.visible\"&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The template drives the application so we get HTML level granularity. If we want to make case by case exceptions, the template makes this easy.</p>\n\n<h2>Closure vs. $scope</h2>\n\n<p>JQuery plugins are created in a closure. Privacy is maintained within that closure. It's up to you to maintain your scope chain within that closure. You only really have access to the set of DOM nodes passed in to the plugin by jQuery, plus any local variables defined in the closure and any globals you have defined. This means that plugins are quite self contained. This is a good thing, but can get restrictive when creating a whole application. Trying to pass data between sections of a dynamic page becomes a chore.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS has $scope objects. These are special objects created and maintained by AngularJS in which you store your model. Certain directives will spawn a new $scope, which by default inherits from its wrapping $scope using JavaScript prototypical inheritance. The $scope object is accessible in the controller and the view.</p>\n\n<p>This is the clever part. Because the structure of $scope inheritance roughly follows the structure of the DOM, elements have access to their own scope, and any containing scopes seamlessly, all the way up to the global $scope (which is not the same as the global scope).</p>\n\n<p>This makes it much easier to pass data around, and to store data at an appropriate level. If a dropdown is unfolded, only the dropdown $scope needs to know about it. If the user updates their preferences, you might want to update the global $scope, and any nested scopes listening to the user preferences would automatically be alerted.</p>\n\n<p>This might sound complicated, in fact, once you relax into it, it's like flying. You don't need to create the $scope object, AngularJS instantiates and configures it for you, correctly and appropriately based on your template hierarchy. AngularJS then makes it available to your component using the magic of dependency injection (more on this later).</p>\n\n<h2>Manual DOM changes vs. Data Binding</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery you make all your DOM changes by hand. You construct new DOM elements programatically. If you have a JSON array and you want to put it to the DOM, you must write a function to generate the HTML and insert it.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS you can do this too, but you are encouraged to make use of data binding. Change your model, and because the DOM is bound to it via a template your DOM will automatically update, no intervention required.</p>\n\n<p>Because data binding is done from the template, using either an attribute or the curly brace syntax, it's super easy to do. There's little cognitive overhead associated with it so you'll find yourself doing it all the time.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;input ng-model=\"user.name\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Binds the input element to <code>$scope.user.name</code>. Updating the input will update the value in your current scope, and vice-versa.</p>\n\n<p>Likewise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;\n  {{user.name}}\n&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>will output the user name in a paragraph. It's a live binding, so if the <code>$scope.user.name</code> value is updated, the template will update too.</p>\n\n<h2>Ajax all of the time</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery making an Ajax call is fairly simple, but it's still something you might think twice about. There's the added complexity to think about, and a fair chunk of script to maintain.</p>\n\n<p>In AngularJS, Ajax is your default go-to solution and it happens all the time, almost without you noticing. You can include templates with ng-include. You can apply a template with the simplest custom directive. You can wrap an Ajax call in a service and create yourself a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\">GitHub</a> service, or a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr\">Flickr</a> service, which you can access with astonishing ease.</p>\n\n<h2>Service Objects vs Helper Functions</h2>\n\n<p>In jQuery, if we want to accomplish a small non-dom related task such as pulling a feed from an API, we might write a little function to do that in our closure. That's a valid solution, but what if we  want to access that feed often? What if we want to reuse that code in another application?</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS gives us service objects.</p>\n\n<p>Services are simple objects that contain functions and data. They are always singletons, meaning there can never be more than one of them. Say we want to access the Stack Overflow API, we might write a <code>StackOverflowService</code> which defines methods for doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say we have a shopping cart. We might define a ShoppingCartService which maintains our cart and contains methods for adding and removing items. Because the service is a singleton, and is shared by all other components, any object that needs to can write to the shopping cart and pull data from it. It's always the same cart.</p>\n\n<p>Service objects are self-contained AngularJS components which we can use and reuse as we see fit. They are simple JSON objects containing functions and Data. They are always singletons, so if you store data on a service in one place, you can get that data out somewhere else just by requesting the same service.</p>\n\n<h2><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\">Dependency injection</a> (DI) vs. Instatiation - aka de-spaghettification</h2>\n\n<p>AngularJS manages your dependencies for you. If you want an object, simply refer to it and AngularJS will get it for you.</p>\n\n<p>Until you start to use this, it's hard to explain just what a massive time boon this is. Nothing like AngularJS DI exists inside jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>DI means that instead of writing your application and wiring it together, you instead define a library of components, each identified by a string.</p>\n\n<p>Say I have a component called 'FlickrService' which defines methods for pulling JSON feeds from Flickr. Now, if I want to write a controller that can access Flickr, I just need to refer to the 'FlickrService' by name when I declare the controller. AngularJS will take care of instantiating the component and making it available to my controller.</p>\n\n<p>For example, here I define a service:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myApp.service('FlickrService', function() {\n  return {\n    getFeed: function() { // do something here }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now when I want to use that service I just refer to it by name like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>myApp.controller('myController', ['FlickrService', function(FlickrService) {\n  FlickrService.getFeed()\n}]);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>AngularJS will recognise that a FlickrService object is needed to instantiate the controller, and will provide one for us.</p>\n\n<p>This makes wiring things together very easy, and pretty much eliminates any tendency towards spagettification. We have a flat list of components, and AngularJS hands them to us one by one as and when we need them.</p>\n\n<h2>Modular service architecture</h2>\n\n<p>jQuery says very little about how you should organise your code. AngularJS has opinions.</p>\n\n<p>AngularJS gives you modules into which you can place your code. If you're writing a script that talks to Flickr for example, you might want to create a Flickr module to wrap all your Flickr related functions in. Modules can include other modules (DI). Your main application is usually a module, and this should include all the other modules your application will depend on.</p>\n\n<p>You get simple code reuse, if you want to write another application based on Flickr, you can just include the Flickr module and voila, you have access to all your Flickr related functions in your new application.</p>\n\n<p>Modules contain AngularJS components. <strong>When we include a module, all the components in that module become available to us as a simple list identified by their unique strings</strong>. We can then inject those components into each other using AngularJS's dependency injection mechanism.</p>\n\n<h2>To sum up</h2>\n\n<p>AngularJS and jQuery are not enemies. It's possible to use jQuery within AngularJS very nicely. If you're using AngularJS well (templates, data-binding, $scope, directives, etc.) you will find you need a <strong>lot</strong> less jQuery than you might otherwise require.</p>\n\n<p>The main thing to realise is that your template drives your application. Stop trying to write big plugins that do everything.

Can multiple humans match the socks faster?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The simplest parallization strategy is to have multiple workers take from the input basket and put the socks onto the piles. This only scales up so much - imagine 100 people fighting over 10 piles. <strong>The synchronization costs</strong> (manifesting themselves as hand-collisions and human communication) <strong>destroy efficiency and speed-up</strong> (see the <a href=\"http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html\">Universal Scalability Law</a>!). Is this prone to <strong>deadlocks</strong>? No, because each worker only needs to access one pile at a time. With just one \"lock\" there cannot be a deadlock. <strong>Livelocks</strong> might be possible depending on how the humans coordinate access to piles. They might just use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff\">random backoff</a> like network cards do that on a physical level to determine what card can exclusively access the network wire. If it works for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller\">NICs</a>, it should work for humans as well.</li>\n<li>It scales nearly indefinitely if <strong>each worker has its own set of piles</strong>. Workers can then take big chunks of socks from the input basket (very little contention as they are doing it rarely) and they do not need to synchronise when distributing the socks at all (because they have thread-local piles). At the end, all workers need to union their pile-sets. I believe that can be done in O(log (worker count * piles per worker)) if the workers form an <strong>aggregation tree</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>What about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem\">element distinctness problem</a>? As the article states, the element distinctness problem can be solved in <code>O(N)</code>. This is the same for the socks problem (also <code>O(N)</code>, if you need only one distribution step (I proposed multiple steps only because humans are bad at calculations - one step is enough if you distribute on <code>md5(color, length, pattern, ...)</code>, i.e. a <strong>perfect hash</strong> of all attributes)).</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, one cannot go faster than <code>O(N)</code>, so we have reached the <strong>optimal lower bound</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Although the outputs are not exactly the same (in one case, just a boolean.

Examples of abstraction in real life interactions with computers includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Folder icons used for navigation in a GUI (graphical user interface) to access an address instead of typing the actual address to navigate to a location.</li>\n<li>GUI sliders used to control various levels like volume, document scroll position, etc..</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe the asker was thinking of applying hashing such that the slot to which either pair of sock goes should be known before placing them.</p>\n\n<p><em>That's why I suggested abstracting a single sock that is placed on the floor as the hashkey itself</em> (hence there is no need to duplicate the socks).</p>\n\n<p>How to define our hashkey?</p>\n\n<p><em>The below definition for our key would also work if there are more than one pair of similar socks. That is, let's say there are two pairs of black men socks PairA and PairB, and each socks are named PairA-L, PairA-R, PairB-L, PairB-R. So PairA-L can be paired with PairB-R, but PairA-L and PairB-L cannot be paired.</em></p>\n\n<p>Let say any sock can be uniqly identified by,</p>\n\n<p><code>Attribute[Gender] + Attribute[Colour] + Attribute[Material] + Attribute[Type1] + Attribute[Type2] + Attribute[Left_or_Right]</code></p>\n\n<p>This is our first hash function. Let's use a short notation for this <code>h1(G_C_M_T1_T2_LR)</code>. <strong>h1(x)</strong> is not our location key.</p>\n\n<p>Another hash function eliminating the Left_or_Right attribute would be <code>h2(G_C_M_T1_T2)</code>. This second function <strong>h2(x)</strong> is our location key!

If they don't match, you have a pair. Else throw the sock into same slot.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>NOTE: Since we remove a pair once we find one, it's safe to assume that there would only be at a maximum one slot with a unique h2(x) or h1(x) value.</p>\n\n<p><em>In case we have each sock with exactly one matching pair then use h2(x) for finding the location and if no pair, a check is required, since it's safe to assume they are a pair.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it important to lay the socks on the floor</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let's consider a scenario where the socks are stacked over one another in a pile (worst case). This means we would have no other choice but to do a linear search to find a pair.</p>\n\n<p>Spreading them on the floor gives more visibility which improves the chance of spotting the matching sock (matching a haskey). \nWhen a sock was placed on the floor in step 3, our mind had subconciously registered the location. \n  - So in case this location is available in our memory we can directly find the matching pair.\n  - In case the location is not remembered, don't worry, then we can always revert back to linear search.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is it important to remove the pair from the floor?</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Short-term human memory works best when it has fewer items to remember. Thus increasing the probability of us resorting to hashing to spot the pair. </li>\n<li>It will also reduce the number of items to be searched through when linear searching for pair is being used.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Case 1: Worst case when Derpina cannot remember or spot the socks on the floor directly using the hashing technique. Derp does a linear search through the items on the floor. This is not worse than the iterating throught the pile to find the pair.\n<ul>\n<li>Upper bound for comparison: O(n^2).</li>\n<li>Lower bound for comparison: (n/2). (when every other sock Derpina picks up is the pair of previous one).</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Case 2: Derp remembers each the location of every sock that he placed on the floor and each sock has exactly one pair.\n<ul>\n<li>Upper bound for comparison: O(n/2).</li>\n<li>Lower bound for comparison: O(n/2).</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am talking about comparison operations, picking the socks from the pile would necessarily be n number of operations. So a practical lower bound would be n iterations with n/2 comparisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Speeding up things</strong></p>\n\n<p>To achieve a perfect score so Derp gets O(n/2) comparisons, I would recommend Derpina to,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>spend more time with the socks to get familiarize with it. Yes, that means spending more time with Derp's socks too.</li>\n<li>Playing memory games like spot the pairs in a grid can improve short-term memory performance, which can be highly beneficial.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Is this equivalent to the element distinctness problem?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The method I suggested is one of the method used to solve element distinctness problem where you place them in hash table and do the comparison. </p>\n\n<p>Given your special case where there exist only one exact pair, it has become very much equivalent to the element distinct problem. Since we can even sort the socks and check adjacent socks for pairs (another solution for EDP). </p>\n\n<p>However, if there is a possibility of more than one pair that can exists for given sock then it deviates from EDP.</p>\n", "title": "How to pair socks from a pile efficiently?", "answer_id": 14441092, "question_id": 14415881, "tags": ["algorithm", "sorting", "language-agnostic", "matching"]}, {"body": "<p>This is how I actually do it, for <em>p</em> pairs of socks (<em>n = 2p</em> individual socks):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Grab a sock at random from the pile.</li>\n<li>For the first sock, or if all previously-chosen socks have been paired, simply place the sock into the first \"slot\" of an \"array\" of unpaired socks in front of you.</li>\n<li>If you have one or more selected unpaired socks, check your current sock against all the unpaired socks in the array. \n<ul>\n<li>It is possible to separate socks into general classes or types (white/black, ankle/crew, athletic/dress) when building your array, and \"drill-down\" to only compare like-for-like.</li>\n<li>If you find an acceptable match, put both socks together and remove them from the array.</li>\n<li>If you do not, put the current sock into the first open slot in the array.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Repeat with every sock.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The worst-case scenario of this scheme is that every pair of socks is different enough that it must be matched exactly, and that the first <em>n/2</em> socks you pick are all different.

For example, the concept of \"red car\" maps to all the red cars a person is capable of remembering. Someone with a perfect memory has a perfect mapping.  Most people are imperfect in this regard (and most others).  The associative map has a limited capacity. Mappings may <em>bleep</em> out of existence under various circumstances (one beer too many), be recorded in error (\"I though her name was Betty, not Nettie\"), or never be overwritten even though we observe that the truth has changed (\"dad's car\" evokes \"orange Firebird\" when we actually knew he'd traded that in for the red Camaro).</p>\n\n<p>In the case of socks, perfect recall means looking at a sock <code>s</code> always produces the memory of its sibling <code>t</code>, including enough information (where it is on the ironing board) to locate <code>t</code> in constant time.  A person with photographic memory accomplishes both 1 and 2 in constant time without fail.</p>\n\n<p>Someone with less than perfect memory might use a few commonsense equivalence classes based on features within his capability to track: size (papa, mama, baby), color (greenish, redish, etc.), pattern (argyle, plain, etc.), style (footie, knee-high, etc.).  So the ironing board would be divided into sections for the categories. This usually allows the category to be located in constant time by memory, but then a linear search through the category \"bucket\" is needed. </p>\n\n<p>Someone with no memory or imagination at all (sorry) will just keep the socks in one pile and do a linear search of the whole pile.</p>\n\n<p>A neat freak might use numeric labels for pairs as someone suggested.

Certainly a \"best\" <em>meta</em>-algorithm is to hire the worlds best sock-sorter: a person or machine that can aquire and quickly store a huge set N of sock attribute sets in a 1-1 associative memory with constant time lookup, insert, and delete. Both people and machines like this can be procured. If you have one, you can pair all the socks in O(N) time for N pairs, which is optimal.

Then the best solution is simply to throw all socks on a table. This involves those steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Throw all socks on a table (1) and create a hashmap {pattern: position} (\u03b5)</li>\n<li>While there are remaining socks (n/2):\n<ol>\n<li>Pick up one random sock (1)</li>\n<li>Find position of corresponding sock (\u03b5)</li>\n<li>Retrieve sock (1) and store pair</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is indeed the fastest possibility and is executed in n + 1 = O(n) complexity.

This is particularly true if you have dark/grey pairs or white sport socks that often have very similar patterns! Let's admit that you have a probability of P of finding the corresponding sock.

I noticed that all of the answers neglect the fact that there are two points where you can perform <strong>preprocessing</strong>, without slowing down your overall laundry performance.</p>\n\n<p>Also, we don't need to assume a large number of socks, even for large families. Socks are taken out of the drawer and are worn, and then are tossed in a place (maybe a bin) where they stay before being laundered.

As with washing machines, clothelines are finite, and I assume that we have the whole part of the line where we put our socks in sight.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the algorithm for put_socks_on_line():</p>\n\n<pre><code>while (socks left in basket) {\n take_sock();\n if (cluster of similar socks is present) { \n   Add sock to cluster (if possible, next to the matching pair)\n } else {\n  Hang it somewhere on the line, this is now a new cluster of similar-looking socks.      \n  Leave enough space around this sock to add other socks later on \n }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Don't waste your time moving socks around or looking for the best match, this all should be done in O(n), which we would also need for just putting them on the line unsorted.\nThe socks aren't paired yet, we only have several similarity clusters on the line.

Usually, about 75% of the socks are already paired, leaving me with a very small subset of socks, and this subset is already (somewhat) clustered (I don't introduce much entropy into my basket after the preprocessing steps).

You can find it on the %provide page in the sections on the value and constant methods.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/R2Frv/1/\">http://jsfiddle.net/R2Frv/1/</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-app=\"MyAppName\"&gt;\n    &lt;div ng-controller=\"MyCtrl\"&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;from Service: {{servGreet}}&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;from Provider: {{provGreet}}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n    var myApp = angular.module('MyAppName', []);\n\n    myApp.constant('a', 'Robert');\n    myApp.value('b', {name: 'Jones'});\n\n    myApp.service('greetService', function(a,b) {\n        this.greeter = 'Hi there, ' + a + ' ' + b.name;\n    });\n\n    myApp.provider('greetProvider', function(a) {\n        this.firstName = a;\n        this.$get = function(b) {\n            this.lastName = b.name;\n            this.fullName = this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;\n            return this;\n        };\n    });\n\n    function MyCtrl($scope, greetService, greetProvider) {\n        $scope.servGreet = greetService.greeter;\n        $scope.provGreet = greetProvider.fullName;\n    }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "answer_id": 16638806, "question_id": 15666048, "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"]}, {"body": "<h2><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/pkozlowski_opensource/PxdSP/14/\">JS Fiddle Demo</a></h2>\n\n<h2>\" Hello world \" example with <code>factory</code> / <code>service</code> / <code>provider</code>:</h2>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>var myApp = angular.module('myApp', []);\r\n\r\n//service style, probably the simplest one\r\nmyApp.service('helloWorldFromService', function() {\r\n    this.sayHello = function() {\r\n        return \"Hello, World!\";\r\n    };\r\n});\r\n\r\n//factory style, more involved but more sophisticated\r\nmyApp.factory('helloWorldFromFactory', function() {\r\n    return {\r\n        sayHello: function() {\r\n            return \"Hello, World!\";\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n});\r\n    \r\n//provider style, full blown, configurable version     \r\nmyApp.provider('helloWorld', function() {\r\n\r\n    this.name = 'Default';\r\n\r\n    this.$get = function() {\r\n        var name = this.name;\r\n        return {\r\n            sayHello: function() {\r\n                return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    this.setName = function(name) {\r\n        this.name = name;\r\n    };\r\n});\r\n\r\n//hey, we can configure a provider!            \r\nmyApp.config(function(helloWorldProvider){\r\n    helloWorldProvider.setName('World');\r\n});\r\n        \r\n\r\nfunction MyCtrl($scope, helloWorld, helloWorldFromFactory, helloWorldFromService) {\r\n    \r\n    $scope.hellos = [\r\n        helloWorld.sayHello(),\r\n        helloWorldFromFactory.sayHello(),\r\n        helloWorldFromService.sayHello()];\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.23/angular.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;body ng-app=\"myApp\"&gt;\r\n&lt;div ng-controller=\"MyCtrl\"&gt;\r\n    {{hellos}}\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "answer_id": 17944367, "question_id": 15666048, "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"]}, {"body": "<p>All Services are <strong>singletons</strong>; they get instantiated once per app. They can be <strong>of any type</strong>, whether it be a primitive, object literal, function, or even an instance of a custom type.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>value</code>, <code>factory</code>, <code>service</code>, <code>constant</code>, and <code>provider</code> methods are all providers.

These won\u2019t be directly accessible from the controller, but we will eventually set up some getter/setter methods on \u2018service\u2019 to be able to alter these \u2018private\u2019 variables when needed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory(\u2018myFactory\u2019, function($http, $q){\n  var service = {};\n  var baseUrl = \u2018https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=\u2019;\n  var _artist = \u2018\u2019;\n  var _finalUrl = \u2018\u2019;\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n   _artist = _artist.split(\u2018 \u2018).join(\u2018+\u2019);\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + \u2018&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK\u2019;\n    return _finalUrl\n  }\n\n  return service;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re not attaching those variables/function to \u2018service\u2019. We\u2019re simply creating them in order to either use or modify them later.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>baseUrl is the base URL that the iTunes API requires</li>\n<li>_artist is the artist we wish to lookup</li>\n<li>_finalUrl is the final and fully built URL to which we\u2019ll make the call to iTunes </li>\n<li>makeUrl is a function that will create and return our iTunes friendly URL.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now that our helper/private variables and function are in place, let\u2019s add some properties to the \u2018service\u2019 object. Whatever we put on \u2018service\u2019 we\u2019ll be able to directly use in whichever controller we pass \u2018myFactory\u2019 into.</p>\n\n<p>We are going to create setArtist and getArtist methods that simply return or set the artist. We are also going to create a method that will call the iTunes API with our created URL. This method is going to return a promise that will fulfill once the data has come back from the iTunes API. If you haven\u2019t had much experience using promises in AngularJS, I highly recommend doing a deep dive on them.</p>\n\n<p>Below <strong>setArtist</strong> accepts an artist and allows you to set the artist. <strong>getArtist</strong> returns the artist. <strong>callItunes</strong> first calls makeUrl() in order to build the URL we\u2019ll use with our $http request. Then it sets up a promise object, makes an $http request with our final url, then because $http returns a promise, we are able to call .success or .error after our request. We then resolve our promise with the iTunes data, or we reject it with a message saying \u2018There was an error\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory('myFactory', function($http, $q){\n  var service = {};\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  service.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  service.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  service.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n  return service;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now our factory is complete. We are now able to inject \u2018myFactory\u2019 into any controller and we\u2019ll then be able to call our methods that we attached to our service object (setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myFactoryCtrl', function($scope, myFactory){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the controller above we\u2019re injecting in the \u2018myFactory\u2019 service. We then set properties on our $scope object with data from \u2018myFactory\u2019. The only tricky code above is if you\u2019ve never dealt with promises before. Because callItunes is returning a promise, we are able to use the .then() method and only set $scope.data.artistData once our promise is fulfilled with the iTunes data. You\u2019ll notice our controller is very \u2018thin\u2019 (This is a good coding practise). All of our logic and persistent data is located in our service, not in our controller.\n<br><br>\n<strong>2) Service</strong> <br>\nPerhaps the biggest thing to know when dealing with creating a Service is that that it\u2019s instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. For you JavaScript gurus this should give you a big hint into the nature of the code. For those of  you with a limited background in JavaScript or for those who aren\u2019t too familiar with what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword actually does, let\u2019s review some JavaScript fundamentals that will eventually help us in understanding the nature of a Service.</p>\n\n<p>To really see the changes that occur when you invoke a function with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, let\u2019s create a function and invoke it with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, then let\u2019s show what the interpreter does when it sees the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. The end results will both be the same.</p>\n\n<p>First let\u2019s create our Constructor.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a typical JavaScript constructor function. Now whenever we invoke the Person function using the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, \u2018this\u2019 will be bound to the newly created object.</p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s add a method onto our Person\u2019s prototype so it will be available on every instance of our Person \u2018class\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Person.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert(\u2018My name is \u2018 + this.name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, because we put the sayName function on the prototype, every instance of Person will be able to call the sayName function in order alert that instance\u2019s name.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we have our Person constructor function and our sayName function on its prototype, let\u2019s actually create an instance of Person then call the sayName function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var tyler = new Person(\u2018Tyler\u2019, 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts \u2018My name is Tyler\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So all together the code for creating a Person constructor, adding a function to it\u2019s prototype, creating a Person instance, and then calling the function on its prototype looks like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\nPerson.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert(\u2018My name is \u2018 + this.name);\n}\nvar tyler = new Person(\u2018Tyler\u2019, 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts \u2018My name is Tyler\u2019\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s look at what actually is happening when you use the \u2018new\u2019 keyword in JavaScript. First thing you should notice is that after using \u2018new\u2019 in our example, we\u2019re able to call a method (sayName) on \u2018tyler\u2019 just as if it were an object - that\u2019s because it is. \nSo first, we know that our Person constructor is returning an object, whether we can see that in the code or not. Second, we know that because our sayName function is located on the prototype and not directly on the Person instance, the object that the Person function is returning must be delegating to its prototype on failed lookups. In more simple terms, when we call tyler.sayName() the interpreter says \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to look on the \u2018tyler\u2019 object we just created, locate the sayName function, then call it. Wait a minute, I don\u2019t see it here - all I see is name and age, let me check the prototype. Yup, looks like it\u2019s on the prototype, let me call it.\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Below is code for how you can think about what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword is actually doing in JavaScript. It\u2019s basically a code example of the above paragraph. I\u2019ve put the \u2018interpreter view\u2019 or the way the interpreter sees the code inside of notes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  //The below line creates an object(obj) that will delegate to the person\u2019s prototype on failed lookups.\n  //var obj = Object.create(Person.prototype);\n\n  //The line directly below this sets \u2018this\u2019 to the newly created object\n  //this = obj;\n\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n\n  //return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now having this knowledge of what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword really does in JavaScript, creating a Service in AngularJS should be easier to understand.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing to understand when creating a Service is knowing that Services are instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. Combining that knowledge with our examples above, you should now recognize that you\u2019ll be attaching your properties and methods directly to \u2018this\u2019 which will then be returned from the Service itself. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike what we originally did with the Factory example, we don\u2019t need to create an object then return that object because, like mentioned many times before, we used the \u2018new\u2019 keyword so the interpreter will create that object, have it delegate to it\u2019s prototype, then return it for us without us having to do the work.</p>\n\n<p>First things first, let\u2019s create our \u2018private\u2019 and helper function. This should look very familiar since we did the exact same thing with our factory. I won\u2019t explain what each line does here because I did that in the factory example, if you\u2019re confused, re-read the factory example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we\u2019ll attach all of our methods that will be available in our controller to \u2018this\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  this.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  this.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  this.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now just like in our factory, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be available in whichever controller we pass myService into. Here\u2019s the myService controller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory controller).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myServiceCtrl', function($scope, myService){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myService.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myService.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like I mentioned before, once you really understand what \u2018new\u2019 does, Services are almost identical to factories in AngularJS.\n<br><br>\n<strong>3) Provider</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing to remember about Providers is that they\u2019re the only service that you can pass into the app.config portion of your application. This is of huge importance if you\u2019re needing to alter some portion of your service object before it\u2019s available everywhere else in your application. Although very similar to Services/Factories, there are a few differences which we\u2019ll discuss.</p>\n\n<p>First we set up our Provider in a similar way we did with our Service and Factory. The variables below are our \u2018private\u2019 and helper function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.provider('myProvider', function(){\n   var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  //Going to set this property on the config function below.\n  this.thingFromConfig = \u2018\u2019;\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>*Again if any portion of the above code is confusing, check out the Factory section where I explain what it all does it greater details.</p>\n\n<p>You can think of Providers as having three sections. The first section is the \u2018private\u2019 variables/functions that will be modified/set later (shown above). The second section is the variables/functions that will be available in your app.config function and are therefore available to alter before they\u2019re available anywhere else (also shown above). It\u2019s important to note that those variables need to be attached to the \u2018this\u2019 keyword. In our example, only \u2018thingFromConfig\u2019 will be available to alter in the app.config. The third section (shown below) is all the variables/functions that will be available in your controller when you pass in the \u2018myProvider\u2019 service into that specific controller.</p>\n\n<p>When creating a service with Provider, the only properties/methods that will be available in your controller are those properties/methods which are returned from the $get() function. The code below puts $get on \u2018this\u2019 (which we know will eventually be returned from that function). Now, that $get function returns all the methods/properties we want to be available in the controller. Here\u2019s a code example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.$get = function($http, $q){\n    return {\n      callItunes: function(){\n        makeUrl();\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n        $http({\n          method: 'JSONP',\n          url: _finalUrl\n        }).success(function(data){\n          deferred.resolve(data);\n        }).error(function(){\n          deferred.reject('There was an error')\n        })\n        return deferred.promise;\n      },\n      setArtist: function(artist){\n        _artist = artist;\n      },\n      getArtist: function(){\n        return _artist;\n      },\n      thingOnConfig: this.thingFromConfig\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now the full Provider code looks like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.provider('myProvider', function(){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  //Going to set this property on the config function below\n  this.thingFromConfig = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  this.$get = function($http, $q){\n    return {\n      callItunes: function(){\n        makeUrl();\n        var deferred = $q.defer();\n        $http({\n          method: 'JSONP',\n          url: _finalUrl\n        }).success(function(data){\n          deferred.resolve(data);\n        }).error(function(){\n          deferred.reject('There was an error')\n        })\n        return deferred.promise;\n      },\n      setArtist: function(artist){\n        _artist = artist;\n      },\n      getArtist: function(){\n        return _artist;\n      },\n      thingOnConfig: this.thingFromConfig\n    }\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now just like in our factory and Service, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be available in whichever controller we pass myProvider into. Here\u2019s the myProvider controller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory/Service controller).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myProviderCtrl', function($scope, myProvider){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myProvider.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myProvider.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n\n  $scope.data.thingFromConfig = myProvider.thingOnConfig;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As mentioned before, the whole point of creating a service with Provider is to be able to alter some variables through the app.config function before the final object is passed to the rest of the application. Let\u2019s see an example of that.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.config(function(myProviderProvider){\n  //Providers are the only service you can pass into app.config\n  myProviderProvider.thingFromConfig = 'This sentence was set in app.config. Providers are the only service that can be passed into config. Check out the code to see how it works';\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can see how \u2018thingFromConfig\u2019 is as empty string in our provider, but when that shows up in the DOM, it will be \u2018This sentence was set\u2026\u2019.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "answer_id": 23683176, "question_id": 15666048, "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"]}, {"body": "<p>My understanding is very simple below. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Factory:</strong>\n  You simply create an object inside of the factory and return it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Service:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You just have a standard function that uses this keyword to define a function.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Provider:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is a <code>$get</code> object that you define and it can be used to get the object that returns data.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "answer_id": 24053985, "question_id": 15666048, "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>Service vs provider vs factory:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I am trying to keep it simple. It's all about basic JavaScript concept.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, let's talk about <strong>services</strong> in AngularJS!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is Service:</strong>\nIn AngularJS, <strong>Service</strong> is nothing but a singleton JavaScript object which can store some useful methods or properties. This singleton object is created per ngApp(Angular app) basis and it is shared among all the controllers within current app. When Angularjs instantiate a service object, it register this service object with a unique service name. So each time when we need service instance, Angular search the registry for this service name, and it returns the reference to service object. Such that we can invoke method, access properties etc on the service object.\nYou may have question whether you can also put properties, methods on scope object of controllers! So why you need service object? Answers is: services are shared among multiple controller scope. If you put some properties/methods in a controller's scope object , it will be available to current scope only. But when you define methods, properties on service object, it will be available globally and can be accessed in any  controller's scope by injecting that service.</p>\n\n<p>So if there are three controller scope, let it be controllerA, controllerB and controllerC, all will share same service instance.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller='controllerA'&gt;\n    &lt;!-- controllerA scope --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div ng-controller='controllerB'&gt;\n    &lt;!-- controllerB scope --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div ng-controller='controllerC'&gt;\n    &lt;!-- controllerC scope --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>How to create a service?</strong></p>\n\n<p>AngularJS provide different methods to register a service. Here we will concentrate on three methods factory(..),service(..),provider(..);</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsbin.com/vaken/16/edit?html,js,output\">Use this link for code reference</a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Factory function:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We can define a factory function as below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>factory('serviceName',function fnFactory(){ return serviceInstance;})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>AngularJS provides <strong>'factory('serviceName', fnFactory)'</strong> method which takes two parameter, serviceName and a JavaScript function. Angular creates service instance by invoking the function <strong>fnFactory()</strong> such as below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var serviceInstace = fnFactory();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The passed function can define a object and return that object. AngularJS simply stores this object reference to a variable which is passed as first argument. Anything which is returned from fnFactory will be bound to serviceInstance . Instead of returning object , we can also return function, values etc, Whatever we will return , will be available to service instance.</p>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var app= angular.module('myApp', []);\n//creating service using factory method\napp.factory('factoryPattern',function(){\n  var data={\n    'firstName':'Tom',\n    'lastName':' Cruise',\n    greet: function(){\n      console.log('hello!' + this.firstName + this.lastName);\n    }\n  };\n\n  //Now all the properties and methods of data object will be available in our service object\n  return data;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Service Function:</h2>\n\n<pre><code>service('serviceName',function fnServiceConstructor(){})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's the another way, we can register a service. The only difference is the way AngularJS tries to instantiate the service object. This time angular uses 'new' keyword and call the constructor function something like below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var serviceInstance = new fnServiceConstructor();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the constructor function we can use 'this' keyword for adding properties/methods to the service object.\nexample:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//Creating a service using the service method\nvar app= angular.module('myApp', []);\napp.service('servicePattern',function(){\n  this.firstName ='James';\n  this.lastName =' Bond';\n  this.greet = function(){\n    console.log('My Name is '+ this.firstName + this.lastName);\n  };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2><strong>Provider function:</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Provider() function is the another way for creating services. Let we are interested to create a service which just display some greeting message to the user. But we also want to provide a functionality such that user can set their own greeting message. In technical terms we want to create configurable services. How can we do this ? There must be a way, so that app could pass their custom greeting messages and Angularjs would make it available to factory/constructor function which create our services instance.\nIn such a case provider() function do the job. using provider() function we can create configurable services.</p>\n\n<p>We can create configurable services using provider syntax as given below.</p>\n\n<pre><code>/*step1:define a service */\napp.provider('service',function serviceProviderConstructor(){});\n\n/*step2:configure the service */\napp.config(function configureService(serviceProvider){});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2><strong>How does provider syntax internally work?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>1.Provider object is created using constructor function we defined in our provider function.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var serviceProvider = new serviceProviderConstructor();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>2.The function we passed in app.config(), get executed. This is called config phase, and here we have a chance to customize our service.</p>\n\n<pre><code>configureService(serviceProvider);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>3.Finally service instance is created by calling $get method of serviceProvider.</p>\n\n<pre><code>serviceInstance = serviceProvider.$get()\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Sample code for creating service using provide syntax:</h2>\n\n<pre><code>var app= angular.module('myApp', []);\napp.provider('providerPattern',function providerConstructor(){\n  //this function works as constructor function for provider\n  this.firstName = 'Arnold ';\n  this.lastName = ' Schwarzenegger' ;\n  this.greetMessage = ' Welcome, This is default Greeting Message' ;\n  //adding some method which we can call in app.config() function\n  this.setGreetMsg = function(msg){\n    if(msg){\n      this.greetMessage =  msg ;\n    }\n  };\n\n  //We can also add a method which can change firstName and lastName\n  this.$get = function(){\n    var firstName = this.firstName;\n    var lastName = this.lastName ;\n    var greetMessage = this.greetMessage;\n    var data={\n       greet: function(){\n         console.log('hello, ' + firstName + lastName+'! '+ greetMessage);\n       }\n    };\n    return data ;\n  };\n});\n\napp.config(\n  function(providerPatternProvider){\n    providerPatternProvider.setGreetMsg(' How do you do ?');\n  }\n);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsbin.com/senufu/6/edit?html,js,output\">Working Demo</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Factory</strong> use a factory function which return a service instance.\n<strong>serviceInstance = fnFactory();</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Service</strong> use a constructor function and Angular invoke this constructor function using 'new' keyword for creating the service instance.\n<strong>serviceInstance = new fnServiceConstructor();</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Provider</strong> defines a providerConstructor function, this providerConstructor function defines a factory function <strong>$get</strong> .

It helps to share reusable code across your app/various components/modules.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From Docs <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/services\"><strong>Service/Factory</strong></a>:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>Lazily instantiated</strong> \u2013 Angular only instantiates a service/factory when an application component depends on it.</li>\n  <li><strong>Singletons</strong> \u2013 Each component\n  dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance\n  generated by the service factory.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Factory</h2>\n\n<p>A factory is function where you can manipulate/add logic before creating an object, then the newly created object gets returned.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory('MyFactory', function() {\n    var serviceObj = {};\n    //creating an object with methods/functions or variables\n    serviceObj.myFunction = function() {\n        //TO DO:\n    };\n    //return that object\n    return serviceObj;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>\n\n<p>It can be just a collection of functions like a class. Hence, it can be instantiated in different controllers when you are injecting it inside your controller/factory/directive functions. It is instantiated only once per app.</p>\n\n<h2>Service</h2>\n\n<p>Simply while looking at the services think about the array prototype. A service is a function which instantiates a new object using the 'new' keyword. You can add properties and functions to a service object by using the <code>this</code> keyword. Unlike a factory, it doesn't return anything (it returns an object which contains methods/properties).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('MyService', function() {\n    //directly binding events to this context\n    this.myServiceFunction = function() {\n        //TO DO:\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>\n\n<p>Use it when you need to share a single object throughout the application. For example, authenticated user details, share-able methods/data, Utility functions etc.</p>\n\n<h2>Provider</h2>\n\n<p>A provider is used to create a configurable service object. You can configure the service setting from config function. It returns a value by using the <code>$get()</code> function. The <code>$get</code> function gets executed on the run phase in angular.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.provider('configurableService', function() {\n    var name = '';\n    //this method can be be available at configuration time inside app.config.\n    this.setName = function(newName) {\n        name = newName;\n    };\n    this.$get = function() {\n        var getName = function() {\n             return name;\n        };\n        return {\n            getName: getName //exposed object to where it gets injected.\n        };\n    };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you need to provide module-wise configuration for your service object before making it available, eg. suppose you want to set your API URL on basis of your Environment like <code>dev</code>, <code>stage</code> or <code>prod</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>NOTE</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>Only provider will be available in config phase of angular, while\n  service &amp; factory are not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hope this has cleared up your understanding about <strong>Factory, Service and Provider</strong>.</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS: Service vs provider vs factory", "answer_id": 28262966, "question_id": 15666048, "tags": ["angularjs", "dependency-injection", "angularjs-service", "angularjs-factory", "angularjs-provider"]}, {"body": "<p><a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers\">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers</a> This should probably be the canonical source for the answer to this question.

That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, <code>$.ajax</code> returns immediately and the next statement, <code>return result;</code>, is executed before the function you passed as <code>success</code> callback was even called.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer: </p>\n\n<h2>Synchronous</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer you needed.</p>\n\n<p>The same is happening when you make a function call containing \"normal\" code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function findItem() {\n    var item;\n    while(item_not_found) {\n        // search\n    }\n    return item;\n}\n\nvar item = findItem();\n\n// Do something with item\ndoSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even though <code>findItem</code> might take a long time to execute, any code coming after <code>var item = findItem();</code> has to <em>wait</em> until the function returns the result.</p>\n\n<h2>Asynchronous</h2>\n\n<p>You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should <em>call you back</em> on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.</p>\n\n<p>That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request. </p>\n\n<pre><code>findItem(function(item) {\n    // Do something with item\n});\ndoSomethingElse();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a <em>callback</em> (notice something? <em>call back</em> ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Solution(s)</h1>\n\n<p><strong>Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript!</strong> While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does \"Ajax\"), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it bad do you ask?</p>\n\n<p>JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not. </p>\n\n<p>All of this is really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.</p>\n\n<h2>Restructure code</h2>\n\n<h3>Let functions accept callbacks</h3>\n\n<p>The better approach is to organize your code properly around callbacks. In the example in the question, you can make <code>foo</code> accept a callback and use it as <code>success</code> callback. So this</p>\n\n<pre><code>var result = foo();\n// Code that depends on 'result'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>becomes</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo(function(result) {\n    // Code that depends on 'result'\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we pass a function as argument to <code>foo</code>. You can pass any function reference, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function myCallback(result) {\n    // Code that depends on 'result'\n}\n\nfoo(myCallback);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>foo</code> itself is defined as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo(callback) {\n    $.ajax({\n        // ...\n        success: callback\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>callback</code> will refer to the function we pass to <code>foo</code> when we call it and we simply pass it on to <code>success</code>. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, <code>$.ajax</code> will call <code>callback</code> and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with <code>result</code>, since this is how we defined the callback).</p>\n\n<p>You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo(callback) {\n    $.ajax({\n        // ...\n        success: function(response) {\n            // For example, filter the response\n            callback(filtered_response);\n        }\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It's easier to write code using callbacks than it seems. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.<br>\nDifficulties could arise when you have to work with third party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.</p>\n\n<h3>Use promises</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">Promise API</a> is a new feature of ECMAScript 6, but it has good <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises\">browser support</a> already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird\">bluebird</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Promises are containers for <em>future</em> values. When the promise receives the value (it is <em>resolved</em>) or when it is cancelled (<em>rejected</em>), it notifies all of its \"listeners\" who want to access this value.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you do decouple your code and they are easier to compose.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple example of using a promise:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function delay() {\n  // `delay` returns a promise\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42\n    }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\ndelay().then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise\n  console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved\n}).catch(function(v) {\n  // Or do something else if it is rejected \n  // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function ajax(url) {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    xhr.onload = function() {\n      resolve(this.responseText);\n    };\n    xhr.onerror = reject;\n    xhr.open('GET', url);\n    xhr.send();\n  });\n}\n\najax(\"/echo/json\").then(function(result) {\n  // Code depending on result\n}).catch(function() {\n  // An error occurred\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Describing all the advantages that promises offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.</p>\n\n<p>More information about promises: <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/\">HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises</a></p>\n\n<h3>jQuery: Use deferred objects</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4866721/what-are-deferred-objects\">Deferred objects</a> are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises, but expose a slightly different API.</p>\n\n<p>Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a \"deferred object\" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function ajax() {\n    return $.ajax(...);\n}\n\najax().done(function(result) {\n    // Code depending on result\n}).fail(function() {\n    // An error occurred\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Promise gotchas</strong></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just <em>containers</em> for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function checkPassword() {\n    return $.ajax({\n        url: '/password',\n        data: {\n            username: $('#username').val(),\n            password: $('#password').val()\n        },\n        type: 'POST',\n        dataType: 'json'\n    });\n}\n\nif (checkPassword()) {\n    // Tell the user they're logged in\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This code misunderstands the above asynchrony issues. Specifically, <code>$.ajax()</code> doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the <code>if</code> statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as <code>true</code>, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.</p>\n\n<p>But the fix is easy:</p>\n\n<pre><code>checkPassword()\n.done(function(r) {\n    if (r) {\n        // Tell the user they're logged in\n    } else {\n        // Tell the user their password was bad\n    }\n})\n.fail(function(x) {\n    // Tell the user something bad happened\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now we're still calling the '/password' page on the server, but our code now properly handles the wait time for the server to respond. The <code>$.ajax()</code> call still returns immediately with a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, but we use it to attach event listeners to <code>.done()</code> and <code>.fail()</code>. In the <code>.done()</code> call, where the server responded with a normal response (HTTP 200), we check the object returned by the server. In this example the server is just returning true if the login was successful, false if not, so <code>if (r)</code> is checking for true/false.</p>\n\n<p>In the <code>.fail()</code> handler we're dealing with something going wrong - for example if the user lost their internet connection while they were typing in their username and password, or if your server went down.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Not recommended: Synchronous \"Ajax\" calls</h3>\n\n<p>As I mentioned, some asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:</p>\n\n<h3>Without jQuery</h3>\n\n<p>If you directly use a <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/\"><code>XMLHTTPRequest</code></a> object, pass <code>false</code> as third argument to <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-open%28%29-method\"><code>.open</code></a>.</p>\n\n<h3>jQuery</h3>\n\n<p>If you use <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/\">jQuery</a>, you can set the <code>async</code> option to <code>false</code>. Note that this option is <em>deprecated</em> since jQuery 1.8.\nYou can then either still use a <code>success</code> callback or access the <code>responseText</code> property of the <a href=\"http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR\">jqXHR object</a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo() {\n    var jqXHR = $.ajax({\n        //...\n        async: false\n    });\n    return jqXHR.responseText;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as <code>$.get</code>, <code>$.getJSON</code>, etc., you have to change it to <code>$.ajax</code> (since you can only pass configuration parameters to <code>$.ajax</code>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Heads up!</strong> It is not possible to make a synchronous <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/please-explain-jsonp\">JSONP</a> request.

That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#send%28%29\"><code>.send</code></a> returns immediately and the next statement, <code>return result;</code>, is executed before the function you passed as <code>success</code> callback was even called.</p>\n\n<p>This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple analogy</p>\n\n<pre><code>function getFive(){ \n    var a;\n    setTimeout(function(){\n         a=5;\n    },10);\n    return a;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/7RK3k/\">(Fiddle)</a></p>\n\n<p>The value of <code>a</code> returned is <code>undefined</code> since the <code>a=5</code> part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.</p>\n\n<p>One possible solution to this problem is to code <em>re-actively</em> , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this\n    alert(a);\n}\n\nfunction getFive(whenDone){ \n    var a;\n    setTimeout(function(){\n         a=5;\n         whenDone(a);\n    },10);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style\">CPS</a>. Basically, we're passing <code>getFive</code> an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).</p>\n\n<p>Usage would be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>getFive(onComplete);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which should alert \"5\" to the screen. <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/PAjZR/\">(Fiddle)</a>.</p>\n\n<h1>Possible solutions</h1>\n\n<p>There are basically two ways how to solve this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make the AJAX call synchronous (lets call it SJAX).</li>\n<li>Restructure your code to work properly with callbacks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>1. Synchronous AJAX - Don't do it!!</h2>\n\n<p>As for synchronous AJAX, <strong>don't do it!</strong> Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.</p>\n  \n  <p>In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you <em>have</em> to do it, you can pass a flag: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests#Synchronous_request\">Here is how:</a></p>\n\n<pre><code>var request = new XMLHttpRequest();\nrequest.open('GET', 'yourURL', false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous\nrequest.send(null);\n\nif (request.status === 200) {// That's HTTP for 'ok'\n  console.log(request.responseText);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>2. Restructure code</h2>\n\n<p>Let your function accept a callback. In the example code <code>foo</code> can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to <em>react</em> when <code>foo</code> completes. </p>\n\n<p>So:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var result = foo();\n// code that depends on `result` goes here\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Becomes:</p>\n\n<pre><code>foo(function(result) {\n    // code that depends on `result`\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function myHandler(result) {\n    // code that depends on `result`\n}\nfoo(myHandler);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer. </p>\n\n<p>Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo(callback) {\n    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // when the request is loaded\n       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// we're calling our method\n    };\n    httpRequest.open('GET', \"/echo/json\");\n    httpRequest.send();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/DAcWT/\">(fiddle)</a></p>\n\n<p>We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully, we can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively solving our issue.</p>\n\n<p>If you're still having a hard time understanding this <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started\">read the AJAX getting started guide</a> at MDN.</p>\n", "title": "How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?", "answer_id": 16825593, "question_id": 14220321, "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "ajax", "asynchronous"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>XHR2</strong> (first of all read the answers from Benjamin Gruenbaum &amp; Felix Kling)</p>\n\n<p>If you don't use jQuery, and want a nice short XHR2 which works on the modern browsers and also on the mobile browsers I suggest to use it this way.</p>\n\n<pre><code>function ajax(a,b,c){ // Url, Callback, just a placeholder\n c=new XMLHttpRequest;\n c.open('GET',a);\n c.onload=b;\n c.send()\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It's shorter than all other functions Listed.</li>\n<li>The callback is set directly (so no extra unnecessary closures).</li>\n<li>It uses the new onload (so you don't have to check for readystate &amp;&amp; status)</li>\n<li>there are some other situations which i don't remember that make the xhr1 annoying. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There are 2 ways to get the response of this ajax call(3 using the xhr var name):</p>\n\n<p>The simplest</p>\n\n<pre><code>this.response\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or if for some reason you <code>bind()</code> the callback to a class</p>\n\n<pre><code>e.target.response\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Example</p>\n\n<pre><code>function callback(e){\n console.log(this.response);\n}\najax('URL',callback);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem)</p>\n\n<pre><code>ajax('URL',function(e){console.log(this.response)});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nothing easier.</p>\n\n<p>Now some ppl will probably say that it's better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name.

I never had any type of problem on all browsers I use.</p>\n\n<p>onreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.</p>\n\n<p>Using the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures else you lost it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now if you want something more complex using post and FormData you can easily extend this function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function x(a,b,e,d,c){ // Url,callback,method,formdata or {key:val},placeholder\n c=new XMLHttpRequest;\n c.open(e||'get',a);\n c.onload=b;\n c.send(d||null)\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Again ... it's a very short function but it does get &amp; post</p>\n\n<p>examples of usage:</p>\n\n<pre><code>x(url,callback);//by default it's get so no need to set\nx(url,callback,'post',{'key':'val'}); //no need to set post data\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or pass a full form element (<code>document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]</code>)</p>\n\n<pre><code>var fd=new FormData(form);\nx(url,callback,'post',fd);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or set some custom values</p>\n\n<pre><code>var fd=new FormData();\nfd.append('key','val')\nx(url,callback,'post',fd);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see I don't implemented sync... it's a bad thing.</p>\n\n<p>Said that ... why don't do it the easy way?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comment the use of error &amp;&amp; synchronous does completely break the point of the answer.Which is a nice short way to use ajax in the proper way.</p>\n\n<p><em>Errror handler</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>function x(a,b,e,d,c){ // URL,callback,method,formdata or {key:val},placeholder\n c=new XMLHttpRequest;\n c.open(e||'get',a);\n c.onload=b;\n c.onerror=error;\n c.send(d||null)\n}\nfunction error(e){\n console.log('--Error--',this.type);\n console.log('this: ',this);\n console.log('Event: ',e)     \n}\nfunction displayAjax(e){\n console.log(e,this);\n}\nx('WRONGURL',displayAjax);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the above script you have an error handler which is statically defined so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.</p>\n\n<p>But to really get out an error the <strong>only</strong> way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browsers throws an error.</p>\n\n<p>error handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob arraybuffer or whatever.... </p>\n\n<p>Even if you pass 'POSTAPAPAP' as methot it won't throw an error.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you pass 'fdggdgilfdghfldj' as formdata it won't throw an error.</p>\n\n<p>In the first case the error is inside the <code>displayAjax()</code> under <code>this.statusText</code>\nas <code>Method not Allowed</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In the second case it simply works.

I have an answer for native XHR. This answer is for generic usage of promises either on the frontend or backend. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>The core issue</h1>\n\n<p>The JavaScript concurrency model in the browser and on the server with NodeJS/io.js is <em>asynchronous</em> and <em>reactive</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you call a method that returns a promise, the <code>then</code> handlers are <em>always</em> executed asynchronously - that is, <strong>after</strong> the code below them that is not in a <code>.then</code> handler.</p>\n\n<p>This means when you're returning <code>data</code> the <code>then</code> handler you've defined did not execute yet. This in turn means that the value you're returning has not been set to the correct value in time. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple analogy for the issue:\n<div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>    function getFive(){\r\n        var data;\r\n        setTimeout(function(){ // set a timer for one second in the future\r\n           data = 5; // after a second, do this\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n        return data;\r\n    }\r\n    document.body.innerHTML = getFive(); // `undefined` here and not 5</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The value of <code>data</code> is <code>undefined</code> since the <code>data = 5</code> part has not executed yet. It will likely execute in a second but by that time it is irrelevant to the returned value.</p>\n\n<p>Since the operation did not happen yet (AJAX, server call, IO, timer) you're returning the value before the request got the chance to tell your code what that value is.</p>\n\n<p>One possible solution to this problem is to code <em>re-actively</em> , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed. Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.</p>\n\n<h1>Quick recap on promises</h1>\n\n<p>A Promise is a <em>value over time</em>. Promises have state, they start as pending with no value and can settle to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>fulfilled</strong> meaning that the computation completed successfully.</li>\n<li><strong>rejected</strong> meaning that the computation failed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A promise can only change states <em>once</em> after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach <code>then</code> handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. <code>then</code> handlers allow <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22539815/arent-promises-just-callbacks\">chaining</a> of calls. Promises are created by <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22519784/how-do-i-convert-an-existing-callback-api-to-promises\">using APIs that return them</a>. For example, the more modern AJAX replacement <code>fetch</code> or jQuery's <code>$.get</code> return promises.</p>\n\n<p>When we call <code>.then</code> on a promise and <em>return</em> something from it - we get a promise for <em>the processed value</em>. If we return another promise we'll get amazing things, but let's hold our horses.</p>\n\n<h1>With promises</h1>\n\n<p>Let's see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let's demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Promise\">Promise constructor</a> for creating a delay function:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function delay(ms){ // takes amount of milliseconds\n    // returns a new promise\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        setTimeout(function(){ // when the time is up\n            resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\n        }, ms);\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, after we converted setTimeout to use promises, we can use <code>then</code> to make it count:</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>function delay(ms){ // takes amount of milliseconds\r\n  // returns a new promise\r\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\r\n    setTimeout(function(){ // when the time is up\r\n      resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\r\n    }, ms);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getFive(){\r\n  // we're RETURNING the promise, remember, a promise is a wrapper over our value\r\n  return delay(100).then(function(){ // when the promise is ready\r\n      return 5; // return the value 5, promises are all about return values\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n// we _have_ to wrap it like this in the call site, we can't access the plain value\r\ngetFive().then(function(five){ \r\n   document.body.innerHTML = five;\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Basically, instead of returning a <em>value</em> which we can't do because of the concurrency model - we're returning a <em>wrapper</em> for a value that we can <em>unwrap</em> with <code>then</code>. It's like a box you can open with <code>then</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Applying this</h3>\n\n<p>This stands the same for your original API call, you can:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function foo() {\n    // RETURN the promise\n    return fetch(\"/echo/json\").then(function(response){\n        return response.json(); // process it inside the `then`\n    });\n}\n\nfoo().then(function(response){\n    // access the value inside the `then`\n})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So this works just as well. We've learned we can't return values from already asynchronous calls but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.</p>\n\n<h1>ES2015 (ES6)</h1>\n\n<p>ES6 introduces <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*\">generators</a> which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function* foo(){ // notice the star, this is ES6 so new browsers/node/io only\n    yield 1;\n    yield 2;\n    while(true) yield 3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is a function that returns an <em>iterator</em> over the sequence <code>1,2,3,3,3,3,....</code> which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility there is one particular interesting case.</p>\n\n<p>If the sequence we're producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of <em>future</em> values - that is: promises.</p>\n\n<p>This somewhat tricky but very powerful trick lets us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several \"runners\" that do this for you, writing one is a short few lines of code but is beyond the scope of this answer. I'll be using Bluebird's <code>Promise.coroutine</code> here, but there are other wrappers like <code>co</code> or <code>Q.async</code>. </p>\n\n<pre><code>var foo = coroutine(function*(){\n    var data = yield fetch(\"/echo/json\"); // notice the yield\n    // code here only executes _after_ the request is done\n    return data.json(); // data is defined\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines.

This allows it to share a lot of the host operating system resources. Also, it uses a layered filesystem (<a href=\"http://aufs.sourceforge.net/\">AuFS</a>) and manages networking. </p>\n\n<p>AuFS is a layered file system, so you can have a read only part and a write part which are merged together. One could have the common parts of the operating system as read only (and shared amongst all of your containers) and then give each container its own mount for writing.</p>\n\n<p>So, let's say you have a 1GB container image; if you wanted to use a Full VM, you would need to have 1GB times x number of VMs you want. With docker and AuFS you can share the bulk of the 1GB between all the containers and if you have 1000 containers you still might only have a little over 1GB of space for the containers OS (assuming they are all running the same OS image).   </p>\n\n<p>A full virtualized system gets its own set of resources allocated to it, and does minimal sharing. You get more isolation, but it is much heavier (requires more resources). With docker you get less isolation, but the containers are lightweight (require fewer resources). So you could easily run thousands of containers on a host, and it won't even blink. Try doing that with Xen, and unless you have a really big host, I don't think it is possible.</p>\n\n<p>A full virtualized system usually takes minutes to start, whereas docker/LXC/runC containers take seconds, and often even less than a second. </p>\n\n<p>There are pros and cons for each type of virtualized system. If you want full isolation with guaranteed resources, a full VM is the way to go. If you just want to isolate processes from each other and want to run a ton of them on a reasonably sized host, then docker/LXC/runC seems to be the way to go.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, check out <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150326185901/http://blog.dotcloud.com/under-the-hood-linux-kernels-on-dotcloud-part\">this set of blog posts</a> which do a good job of explaining how LXC works.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I feel foolish for asking, but why is deploying software to a docker image (if that's the right term) easier than simply deploying to a consistent production environment?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Deploying a consistent production environment is easier said than done. Even if you use tools like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef_%28software%29\">chef</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_%28software%29\">puppet</a>, there are always OS updates and other things that change between hosts and environments. </p>\n\n<p>Docker gives you the ability to snapshot the OS into a shared image, and makes it easy to deploy on other docker hosts. Locally, dev, qa, prod, etc.: all the same image. Sure you can do this with other tools, but not nearly as easily or fast. </p>\n\n<p>This is great for testing; lets say you have thousands of tests that need to connect to a database, and each test needs a pristine copy of the database and will make changes to the data. The classic approach to this is to reset the database after every test either with custom code or with tools like <a href=\"https://flywaydb.org/\">Flyway</a> - this can be very time consuming and means that tests must be run serially. However, with Docker you could create an image of your database and run up one instance per test, and then run all the tests in parallel since you know they will all be running against the same snapshot of the database. Since the tests are running in parallel and in docker containers they could run all on the same box at the same time and should finish much faster. Try doing that with a full VM.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> From comments...</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Interesting! I suppose I'm still confused by the notion of \"snapshot[ting] the OS\". How does one do that without, well, making an image of the OS?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let's see if I can explain. You start with a base image, and then make your changes, and commit those changes using docker, and it creates an image. This image contains only the differences from the base. When you want to run your image, you also need the base, and it layers your image on top of the base using a layered file system: as mentioned above, Docker uses AUFS. AUFS merges the different layers together and you get what you want; you just need to run it. You can keep adding more and more images (layers) and it will continue to only save the diffs. Since docker typically builds on top of ready-made images from a <a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/\">registry</a>, you rarely have to \"snapshot\" the whole OS yourself.</p>\n", "title": "How is Docker different from a normal virtual machine?", "answer_id": 16048358, "question_id": 16047306, "tags": ["docker", "virtual-machine", "virtualization", "docker-container"]}, {"body": "<p>Through this post we are going to draw some lines of differences between VMs and LXCs. Lets first define them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>VM</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>A virtual machine emulates a physical computing environment, but requests for CPU, memory, hard disk, network and other hardware resources are managed by a virtualization layer which translates these requests to the underlying physical hardware.</p>\n\n<p>In this context the VM is called as the Guest while the environment it runs on is called the Host</p>\n\n<p><strong>LXC</strong>s:</p>\n\n<p>Linux Containers (LXC) are operating system-level capabilities that make it possible to run multiple isolated Linux containers, on one control host (the LXC host). Linux Containers serve as a lightweight alternative to VMs as they don\u2019t require the hypervisors viz. Virtualbox, KVM, Xen etc.</p>\n\n<p>Now unless you were drugged by Alan (Zach Galifianakis- from the Hangover series) and have been in Vegas for the last year,  you will be pretty aware about the tremendous spurt of interest for linux containers technology and if I will be specific one container project which has created a buzz around the world in last few months is \u2013 Docker leading to some echoing opinions that cloud computing environments should abandon virtual machines (VMs) and replace them with containers due to their lower overhead and potentially better performance.</p>\n\n<p>But the big question is, is it feasible?, will it be sensible ?</p>\n\n<p>a.  LXCs are scoped to an instance of Linux. It might be different flavors of Linux ( e.g. a Ubuntu container on a Centos host but it\u2019s still Linux. ) Similarly, Windows-based containers are scoped to an instance of Windows now if we look at VMs they have a pretty broader scope and using the hypervisors you  are not limited to Operating Systems  linux or windows.</p>\n\n<p>b. LXCs have low overheads and have better performance as compared to VMs. Tools viz. Docker which are built on the shoulders of LXC technology have provided developers with a platform to run their applications and at the same time have empowered ops people with a tool that will allow them to deploy the same container on production servers or data centers. It tries to make the experience between a developer running an app, booting and testing an app and an operations person deploying that app seamless because this is where all the friction lies in and purpose of DevOps is to break down those silos.</p>\n\n<p>So the best approach is the cloud infrastructure providers should advocate an appropriate use of the VMs and LXC, as they are each suited to handle specific workloads and scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>Abandoning VMs is not practical as of now.

In theory servers can run indefinitely, and be kept completely consistent and up to date.

It uses the host OS's ( currently only linux kernel) clone API which provides namespacing for IPC, NS (mount), network, PID, UTS etc., what about memory, io,  cpu etc., ? that is controlled using cgroups where you can create groups with certain resource ( cpu, memory...) spec/restriction and put your processes in there. On top of lxc, Docker provides storage backend (<a href=\"http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/filesystems/\">http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/filesystems/</a>) e.g.,union mount filesystem where you can add layers and share layers between different mount namespaces . This is a powerful feature where the base images are typically readonly and only when the container modifies something in the layer will it write something to read-write partition ( a.k.a. copy on write ) . It also provides many other wrappers such as registry and versioning of images. With normal lxc you need to come with some rootfs or share the rootfs and when shared, the changes are reflected on other containers.

That will clear up lot of things.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I'm simplifying a bit in describing below. See references for more information.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How virtualization works at low level?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In this case VM manager takes over the CPU ring 0 (or the \"root mode\" in newer CPUs) and intercepts all privileged calls made by guest OS to create illusion that guest OS has its own hardware. Fun fact: Before 1998 it was thought to be impossible to achieve this in x86 architecture because there was no way to do this kind of interception. The folks at VMWare <a href=\"https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/VMware_paravirtualization.pdf\">were the first</a> who had an idea to rewrite the executable bytes in memory for privileged calls of guest OS to achieve this.</p>\n\n<p>The net effect is that virtualization allows you to run two completely different OS on same hardware. Each guest OS goes through all the process of bootstrapping, loading kernel etc. You can have very tight security, for example, guest OS can't get full access to host OS or other guests and mess things up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How containers works at low level?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Around 1996, people including some of the employees at Google implemented new kernel level feature called <em>namespaces</em> (however the idea long before <a href=\"https://www.linux.com/component/content/article/186-virtualization/300057-containers-vs-hypervisors-choosing-the-best-virtualization-technology-\">existed in FreeBSD</a>). One of the function of OS is to allow sharing of global resources like network and disk to processes. What if these global resources were wrapped in namespaces so that they are visible only to those processes that runs in the same namespace? Say, you can get a chunk of disk and put that in namespace X and then processes running in namespace Y can't see or access it. Similarly, processes in namespace X can't access anything in memory that is allocated to namespace Y. Of course, processes in X can't see or talk to processes in namespace Y. This provides kind of virtualization and isolation for global resources. This is how docker works: Each container runs in its own namespace but uses exactly the <em>same</em> kernel as all other containers. The isolation happens because kernel knows the namespace that was assigned to the process and during API calls it makes sure that process can only access resources in its own namespace.</p>\n\n<p>The limitations of containers vs VM should be obvious now: You can't run completely different OS in containers like in VMs. However you <em>can</em> run different distros of Linux because they do share the same kernel. The isolation level is not as strong as in VM. In fact, there was a way for \"guest\" container to take over host in early implementations. Also you can see that when you load new container, the entire new copy of OS doesn't start like it does in VM. All containers <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25444099/why-docker-has-ability-to-run-different-linux-distribution\">share same kernel</a>. This is why containers are light weight. Also unlike VM, you don't have to pre-allocate significant chunk of memory to VM because we are not running new copy of OS. This enables to run thousands of containers on one OS while sandboxing them which might not be possible to do if we were running separate copy of OS in its own VM.</p>\n", "title": "How is Docker different from a normal virtual machine?", "answer_id": 34757096, "question_id": 16047306, "tags": ["docker", "virtual-machine", "virtualization", "docker-container"]}, {"body": "<p>Docker isn't a virtualization methodology. It relies on other tools that actually implement container-based virtualization or operating system level virtualization. For that, Docker was initially using LXC driver, then moved to libcontainer which is now renamed as runc. Docker primarily focuses on automating the deployment of applications inside application containers. Application containers are designed to package and run a single service, whereas system containers are designed to run multiple processes, like virtual machines. So, Docker is considered as a container management or application deployment tool on containerized systems.</p>\n\n<p>In order to know how it is different from other virtualizations, let's go through virtualization and its types. Then, it would be easier to understand what's the difference there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Virtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>In its conceived form, it was considered a method of logically dividing mainframes to allow multiple applications to run simultaneously. However, the scenario drastically changed when companies and open source communities were able to provide a method of handling the privileged instructions in one way or another and allow for multiple operating systems to be run simultaneously on a single x86 based system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hypervisor</strong></p>\n\n<p>The hypervisor handles creating the virtual environment on which the guest virtual machines operate. It supervises the guest systems and makes sure that resources are allocated to the guests as necessary. The hypervisor sits in between the physical machine and virtual machines and provides virtualization services to the virtual machines. To realize it, it intercepts the guest operating system operations on the virtual machines and emulates the operation on the host machine's operating system. </p>\n\n<p>The rapid development of virtualization technologies, primarily in cloud, has driven the use of virtualization further by allowing multiple virtual servers to be created on a single physical server with the help of hypervisors, such as Xen, VMware Player, KVM, etc., and incorporation of hardware support in commodity processors, such as Intel VT and AMD-V.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Types of Virtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>The virtualization method can be categorized based on how it mimics hardware to a guest operating system and emulates guest operating environment. Primarily, there are three types of virtualization:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Emulation </li>\n<li>Paravirtualization </li>\n<li>Container-based virtualization</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Emulation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Emulation, also known as full virtualization runs the virtual machine OS kernel entirely in software. The hypervisor used in this type is known as Type 2 hypervisor. It is installed on the top of host operating system which is responsible for translating guest OS kernel code to software instructions. The translation is done entirely in software and requires no hardware involvement. Emulation makes it possible to run any non-modified operating system that supports the environment being emulated.  The downside of this type of virtualization is additional system resource overhead that leads to decrease in performance compared to other types of virtualizations.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FS8uzm.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/FS8uzm.png\" alt=\"Emulation\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Examples in this category include VMware Player, VirtualBox, QEMU, Bochs, Parallels, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paravirtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>Paravirtualization, also known as Type 1 hypervisor, runs directly on the hardware, or \u201cbare-metal\u201d, and provides virtualization services directly to the virtual machines running on it. It helps the operating system, the virtualized hardware, and the real hardware to collaborate to achieve optimal performance. These hypervisors typically have a rather small footprint and do not, themselves, require extensive resources.</p>\n\n<p>Examples in this category include Xen, KVM, etc.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPO6Um.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/oPO6Um.png\" alt=\"Paravirtualization\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Container-based Virtualization</strong></p>\n\n<p>Container-based virtualization, also know as operating system-level virtualization, enables multiple isolated executions within a single operating system kernel. It has the best possible performance and density and features dynamic resource management. The isolated virtual execution environment provided by this type of virtualization is called container and can be viewed as a traced group of processes. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qTuWpm.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/qTuWpm.png\" alt=\"Container-based virtualization\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The concept of a container is made possible by the namespaces feature added to Linux kernel version 2.6.24. The container adds its ID to every process and adding new access control checks to every system call. It is accessed by the <em>clone()</em> system call that allows creating separate instances of previously-global namespaces. </p>\n\n<p>Namespaces can be used in many different ways, but the most common approach is to create an isolated container that has no visibility or access to objects outside the container. Processes running inside the container appear to be running on a normal Linux system although they are sharing the underlying kernel with processes located in other namespaces, same for other kinds of objects. For instance, when using namespaces, the root user inside the container is not treated as root outside the container, adding additional security. </p>\n\n<p>The Linux Control Groups (cgroups) subsystem, next major component to enable container-based virtualization, is used to group processes and manage their aggregate resource consumption. It is commonly used to limit memory and CPU consumption of containers.  Since a containerized Linux system has only one kernel and the kernel has full visibility into the containers, there is only one level of resource allocation and scheduling.</p>\n\n<p>Several management tools are available for Linux containers, including LXC, LXD, systemd-nspawn, lmctfy, Warden, Linux-VServer, OpenVZ, Docker, etc. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Containers vs Virtual Machines</strong></p>\n\n<p>Unlike a virtual machine, a container does not need to boot the operating system kernel, so containers can be created in less than a second. This feature makes container-based virtualization unique and desirable than other virtualization approaches.</p>\n\n<p>Since container-based virtualization adds little or no overhead to the host machine, container-based virtualization has near-native performance</p>\n\n<p>For container-based virtualization, no additional software is required, unlike other virtualizations.</p>\n\n<p>All containers on a host machine share the scheduler of the host machine saving need of extra resources.</p>\n\n<p>Container states (Docker or LXC images) are small in size compared to virtual machine images, so container images are easy to distribute.</p>\n\n<p>Resource management in containers is achieved through cgroups. Cgroups does not allow containers to consume more resources than allocated to them. However, as of now, all resources of host machine are visible in virtual machines, but can't be used. This can be realized by running <code>top</code> or <code>htop</code> on containers and host machine at the same time. The output across all environments will look similar.  </p>\n", "title": "How is Docker different from a normal virtual machine?", "answer_id": 36368012, "question_id": 16047306, "tags": ["docker", "virtual-machine", "virtualization", "docker-container"]}, {"body": "<p>Most of the answers here talk about virtual machines. I'm going to give you a one-liner response to this question that has helped me the most over the last couple years of using Docker. It's this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Docker is just a fancy way to run a process, not a virtual machine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, let me explain a bit more about what that means. Virtual machines are their own beast. I feel like explaining what <em>Docker</em> is will help you understand this more than explaining what a virtual machine is. Especially because there are many fine answers here telling you exactly what someone means when they say \"virtual machine\". So...</p>\n\n<p>A Docker container is just a process (and its children) that is compartmentalized using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups\">cgroups</a> inside the host system's kernel from the rest of the processes. You can actually see your Docker container processes by running <code>ps aux</code> on the host. For example, starting <code>apache2</code> \"in a container\" is just starting <code>apache2</code> as a special process on the host. It's just been compartmentalized from other processes on the machine. It is important to note that your containers do not exist outside of your containerized process' lifetime. When your process dies, your container dies. That's because Docker replaces <code>pid 1</code> inside your container with your application (<code>pid 1</code> is normally the init system). This last point about <code>pid 1</code> is very important.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the filesystem used by each of those container processes, Docker uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS\">UnionFS</a>-backed images, which is what you're downloading when you do a <code>docker pull ubuntu</code>. Each \"image\" is just a series of layers and related metadata. The concept of layering is very important here. Each layer is just a change from the layer underneath it. For example, when you delete a file in your Dockerfile while building a Docker container, you're actually just creating a layer on top of the last layer which says \"this file has been deleted\". Incidentally, this is why you can delete a big file from your filesystem, but the image still takes up the same amount of disk space. The file is still there, in the layers underneath the current one. Layers themselves are just tarballs of files. You can test this out with <code>docker save --output /tmp/ubuntu.tar ubuntu</code> and then <code>cd /tmp &amp;&amp; tar xvf ubuntu.tar</code>. Then you can take a look around. All those directories that look like long hashes are actually the individual layers. Each one contains files (<code>layer.tar</code>) and metadata (<code>json</code>) with information about that particular layer. Those layers just describe changes to the filesystem which are saved as a layer \"on top of\" its original state. When reading the \"current\" data, the filesystem reads data as though it were looking only at the top-most layers of changes. That's why the file appears to be deleted, even though it still exists in \"previous\" layers, because the filesystem is only looking at the top-most layers. This allows completely different containers to share their filesystem layers, even though some significant changes may have happened to the filesystem on the top-most layers in each container. This can save you a ton of disk space, when your containers share their base image layers. However, when you mount directories and files from the host system into your container by way of volumes, those volumes \"bypass\" the UnionFS, so changes are not stored in layers.</p>\n\n<p>Networking in Docker is achieved by using an ethernet bridge (called <code>docker0</code> on the host), and virtual interfaces for every container on the host. It creates a virtual subnet in <code>docker0</code> for your containers to communicate \"between\" one another. There are many options for networking here, including creating custom subnets for your containers, and the ability to \"share\" your host's networking stack for your container to access directly.</p>\n\n<p>Docker is moving very fast. Its <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/\">documentation</a> is some of the best documentation I've ever seen. It is generally well-written, concise, and accurate. I recommend you check the documentation available for more information, and trust the documentation over anything else you read online, including Stack Overflow.

It's certainly a more heavyweight solution in terms of it being VM based instead of LXC based. However, I've found a decent laptop (8Gb ram, i5/i7 CPU) has no trouble running a VM using Vagrant/Virtual Box alongside development tooling.</p>\n\n<p>One of the really great things with Vagrant is the integration with Puppet/Chef/Shell scripts for automating configuration. If you're using one of these options to configure your production environment, you can create a development environment which is as close to identical as you're going to get, and this is exactly what you want.</p>\n\n<p>The other great thing with Vagrant is that you can version your Vagrantfile along with your application code.

But because I wrote Vagrant, I spend most of my time living in the DevOps world which includes software like Docker. I work with a lot of companies using Vagrant and many use Docker, and I see how the two interplay.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Before I talk too much, a direct answer:</strong> in your specific scenario (yourself working alone, working on Linux, using Docker in production), you can stick with Docker alone and simplify things. In many other scenarios (I discuss further), it isn't so easy.</p>\n\n<p>It isn't correct to directly compare Vagrant to Docker. In some scenarios, they do overlap, and in the vast majority, they don't. Actually, the more apt comparison would be Vagrant versus something like Boot2Docker (minimal OS that can run Docker). Vagrant is a level above Docker in terms of abstractions, so it isn't a fair comparison in most cases.</p>\n\n<p>Vagrant launches things to run apps/services for the purpose of development. This can be on VirtualBox, VMware. It can be remote like AWS, OpenStack. Within those, if you use containers, Vagrant doesn't care, and embraces that: it can automatically install, pull down, build, and run Docker containers, for example. With Vagrant 1.6, Vagrant has <a href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-6-docker-dev-environments.html\">docker-based development environments</a>, and supports using Docker with the same workflow as Vagrant across Linux, Mac, and Windows. Vagrant doesn't try to replace Docker here, it embraces Docker practices.</p>\n\n<p>Docker specifically runs Docker containers. If you're comparing directly to Vagrant: it is specifically a more specific (can only run Docker containers), less flexible (requires Linux or Linux host somewhere) solution. Of course if you're talking about production or CI, there is no comparison to Vagrant! Vagrant doesn't live in these environments, and so Docker should be used. </p>\n\n<p>If your organization runs only Docker containers for all their projects and only has developers running on Linux, then okay, Docker could definitely work for you! </p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, I don't see a benefit to attempting to use Docker alone, since you lose a lot of what Vagrant has to offer, which have real business/productivity benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Vagrant can launch VirtualBox, VMware, AWS, OpenStack, etc. machines. It doesn't matter what you need, Vagrant can launch it. If you are using Docker, Vagrant can install Docker on any of these so you can use them for that purpose.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant is a single workflow for all your projects. Or to put another way, it is just one thing people have to learn to run a project whether it is in a Docker container or not. If, for example, in the future, a competitor arises to compete directly with Docker, Vagrant will be able to run that too. </p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant works on Windows (back to XP), Mac (back to 10.5), and Linux (back to kernel 2.6). In all three cases, the workflow is the same. If you use Docker, Vagrant can launch a machine (VM or remote) that can run Docker on all three of these systems.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant knows how to configure some advanced or non-trivial things like networking and syncing folders. For example: Vagrant knows how to attach a static IP to a machine or forward ports, and the configuration is the same no matter what system you use (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.) For synced folders, Vagrant provides multiple mechanisms to get your local files over to the remote machine (VirtualBox shared folders, NFS, rsync, Samba [plugin], etc.). If you're using Docker, even Docker with a VM without Vagrant, you would have to manually do this or they would have to reinvent Vagrant in this case.</p></li>\n<li><p>Vagrant 1.6 has first-class support for <a href=\"http://www.vagrantup.com/blog/feature-preview-vagrant-1-6-docker-dev-environments.html\">docker-based development environments</a>. This will not launch a virtual machine on Linux, and will automatically launch a virtual machine on Mac and Windows. The end result is that working with Docker is uniform across all platforms, while Vagrant still handles the tedious details of things such as networking, synced folders, etc.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To address specific counter arguments that I've heard in favor of using Docker instead of Vagrant:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>\"It is less moving parts\" - Yes, it can be, if you use Docker exclusively for every project. Even then, it is sacrificing flexibility for Docker lock-in. If you ever decide to not use Docker for any project, past, present, or future, then you'll have more moving parts. If you had used Vagrant, you have that one moving part that supports the rest.</p></li>\n<li><p>\"It is faster!\" - Once you have the host that can run Linux containers, Docker is definitely faster at running a container than any virtual machine would be to launch. But launching a virtual machine (or remote machine) is a one-time cost. Over the course of the day, most Vagrant users never actually destroy their VM. It is a strange optimization for development environments. In production, where Docker really shines, I understand the need to quickly spin up/down containers.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope now its clear to see that it is very difficult, and I believe not correct, to compare Docker to Vagrant. For dev environments, Vagrant is more abstract, more general. Docker (and the various ways you can make it behave like Vagrant) is a specific use case of Vagrant, ignoring everything else Vagrant has to offer. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion: in highly specific use cases, Docker is certainly a possible replacement for Vagrant. In most use cases, it is not. Vagrant doesn't hinder your usage of Docker; it actually does what it can to make that experience smoother. If you find this isn't true, I'm happy to take suggestions to improve things, since a goal of Vagrant is to work equally well with any system.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this clears things up!</p>\n", "title": "Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?", "answer_id": 21314566, "question_id": 16647069, "tags": ["vagrant", "docker"]}, {"body": "<p>I'm the author of Docker.</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is that if you want to manage machines, you should use Vagrant. And if you want to build and run applications environments, you should use Docker.</p>\n\n<p>Vagrant is a tool for managing virtual machines. Docker is a tool for building and deploying applications by packaging them into lightweight containers. A container can hold pretty much any software component along with its dependencies (executables, libraries, configuration files etc.), and execute it in a guaranteed and repeatable runtime environment. This makes it very easy to build your app once and deploy it anywhere - on your laptop for testing, then on different servers for live deployment etc.</p>\n\n<p>It's a common misconception that you can only use Docker on Linux. That's incorrect, you can also install Docker on Mac, and Windows support is underway. When installed on Mac, Docker bundles a tiny linux VM (25MB on disk!) which acts as a wrapper for your container. Once installed this is completely transparent, you can use the docker command-line in exactly the same way. This gives you the best of both worlds: you can test and develop your application using containers, which are very lightweight, easy to test and easy to move around (see for example <a href=\"https://index.docker.io\">https://index.docker.io</a> for sharing reusable containers with the docker community), and you don't need to worry about the nitty-gritty details of managing virtual machines, which are just a means to an end anyway.</p>\n\n<p>In theory it's possible to use Vagrant as an abstraction layer for Docker. I recommend against this for 2 reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, Vagrant is not a good abstraction for Docker. Vagrant was designed to manage virtual machines. Docker was designed to manage an application runtime. This means that Docker, by design, can interact with an application in richer ways, and has more information about the application runtime. The primitives in Docker are processes, log streams, environment variables and network links between components. The primitives in Vagrant are machines, block devices, and ssh keys. Vagrant simply sits lower in the stack, and the only way it can interact with a container is by pretending it's just another kind of machine, that you can \"boot\" and \"log into\". So, sure, you can type \"vagrant up\" with a docker plugin and something pretty will happen. Is it a substitute for the full breadth of what Docker can do? Try native Docker for a couple days and see for yourself :)</p></li>\n<li><p>Second, the lock-in argument. \"If you use Vagrant as an abstraction, you will not be locked into Docker!\". From the point of view of Vagrant, which is designed to manage machines, this makes perfect sense: aren't containers just another kind of machine? Just like EC2 and VMWare, we must be careful not to tie our provisioning tools to any particular vendor! This would create lock-in - better to abstract it all away with Vagrant. Except this misses the point of Docker entirely. Docker doesn't provision machines, it wraps your application in a lightweight portable runtime which can be dropped anywhere. What runtime you choose for your application has nothing to do with how you provision your machines! For example it's pretty frequent to deploy applications to machines which are provisioned by someone else (for example an EC2 instance deployed by your sysadmin, perhaps using Vagrant), or to bare metal machines which Vagrant can't provision at all. Conversely, you may use Vagrant to provision machines which have nothing to do with developing your application - for example a ready-to-use Windows IIS box or something. Or you may use Vagrant to provision machines for projects which don't use Docker - perhaps they use a combination of rubygems and rvm for dependency management and sandboxing for example.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary: Vagrant is for managing machines, Docker is for building and running application environments.</p>\n", "title": "Should I use Vagrant or Docker for creating an isolated environment?", "answer_id": 22370529, "question_id": 16647069, "tags": ["vagrant", "docker"]}, {"body": "<p>Using both is an important part of application delivery testing.

Bower aims for minimal resource load. If you draw out the dependency structure, you will see this:</p>\n\n<p>npm:</p>\n\n<pre><code>project root\n[node_modules] // default directory for dependencies\n -&gt; dependency A\n -&gt; dependency B\n    [node_modules]\n    -&gt; dependency A\n\n -&gt; dependency C\n    [node_modules]\n    -&gt; dependency B\n      [node_modules]\n       -&gt; dependency A \n    -&gt; dependency D\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As you can see it installs some dependencies recursively.

You will have to manually pick which version you want to install. This can have the effect that one of the dependencies will break, but that is something that you will need to fix anyway.</p>\n\n<p>So, the common usage is Bower for the packages that you want to publish on your webpages (e.g. <em>runtime</em>, where you avoid duplication), and use npm for other stuff, like testing, building, optimizing, checking, etc. (e.g. <em>development time</em>, where duplication is of less concern).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update for npm 3:</strong></p>\n\n<p>npm 3 still does things differently compared to Bower.

(npm's use of nested dependencies is hugely helpful in managing large, complex applications.)</p>\n\n<p>I'm surprised, however, that nobody has explicitly explained one of the most fundamental distinctions between Bower and npm. If you read the answers above, you'll see the word 'modules' used often in the context of npm. But it's mentioned casually, as if it might even just be a syntax difference. </p>\n\n<p>But this distinction of <strong>modules vs. globals</strong> (or modules vs. 'scripts') is possibly the most important difference between Bower and npm. <em>The npm approach of putting everything in modules requires you to change the way you write Javascript for the browser, almost certainly for the better.</em></p>\n\n<h3>The Bower Approach: Global Resources, Like <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> Tags</h3>\n\n<p>At root, Bower is about loading plain-old script files. Whatever those script files contain, Bower will load them. Which basically means that Bower is just like including all your scripts in plain-old <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>'s in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML. </p>\n\n<p>So, same basic approach you're used to, but you get some nice automation conveniences: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You used to need to include JS dependencies in your project repo (while developing), or get them via CDN. Now, you can skip that extra download weight in the repo, and somebody can do a quick <code>bower install</code> and instantly have what they need, locally.</li>\n<li>If a Bower dependency then specifies its own dependencies in its <code>bower.json</code>, those'll be downloaded for you as well.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But beyond that, <em>Bower doesn't change how we write javascript</em>. Nothing about what goes inside the files loaded by Bower needs to change at all. In particular, this means that the resources provided in scripts loaded by Bower will (usually, but not always) still be defined as <em>global variables</em>, available from anywhere in the browser execution context.</p>\n\n<h3>The npm Approach: Common JS Modules, Explicit Dependency Injection</h3>\n\n<p>All code in Node land (and thus all code loaded via npm) is structured as modules (specifically, as an implementation of the <a href=\"http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules\">CommonJS module format</a>, or now, as an ES6 module). So, if you use NPM to handle browser-side dependencies (via Browserify or something else that does the same job), you'll structure your code the same way Node does.</p>\n\n<p>Smarter people than I have tackled the question of 'Why modules?', but here's a capsule summary:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Anything inside a module is effectively <em>namespaced</em>, meaning it's not a global variable any more, and you can't accidentally reference it without intending to.</li>\n<li>Anything inside a module must be intentionally injected into a particular context (usually another module) in order to make use of it</li>\n<li>This means you can have multiple versions of the same external dependency (lodash, let's say) in various parts of your application, and they won't collide/conflict. (This happens surprisingly often, because your own code wants to use one version of a dependency, but one of your external dependencies specifies another that conflicts. Or you've got two external dependencies that each want a different version.)</li>\n<li>Because all dependencies are manually injected into a particular module, it's very easy to reason about them. You know for a fact: <em>\"The only code I need to consider when working on this is what I have intentionally chosen to inject here\"</em>.</li>\n<li>Because even the content of injected modules is <em>encapsulated</em> behind the variable you assign it to, and all code executes inside a limited scope, surprises and collisions become very improbable. It's much, much less likely that something from one of your dependencies will accidentally redefine a global variable without you realizing it, or that you will do so. (It <em>can</em> happen, but you usually have to go out of your way to do it, with something like <code>window.variable</code>. The one accident that still tends to occur is assigning <code>this.variable</code>, not realizing that <code>this</code> is actually <code>window</code> in the current context.)</li>\n<li>When you want to test an individual module, you're able to very easily know: exactly what else (dependencies) is affecting the code that runs inside the module? And, because you're explicitly injecting everything, you can easily mock those dependencies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To me, the use of modules for front-end code boils down to: working in a much narrower context that's easier to reason about and test, and having greater certainty about what's going on. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It only takes about 30 seconds to learn how to use the CommonJS/Node module syntax. Inside a given JS file, which is going to be a module, you first declare any outside dependencies you want to use, like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>var React = require('react');</code></p>\n\n<p>Inside the file/module, you do whatever you normally would, and create some object or function that you'll want to expose to outside users, calling it perhaps <code>myModule</code>. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of a file, you export whatever you want to share with the world, like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>module.exports = myModule;</code></p>\n\n<p>Then, to use a CommonJS-based workflow in the browser, you'll use tools like Browserify to grab all those individual module files, encapsulate their contents at runtime, and inject them into each other as needed. </p>\n\n<p>AND, since ES6 modules (which you'll likely transpile to ES5 with Babel or similar) are gaining wide acceptance, and work both in the browser or in Node 4.0, we should mention a <a href=\"https://24ways.org/2014/javascript-modules-the-es6-way/\">good overview</a> of those as well. </p>\n\n<p>More about patterns for working with modules in <a href=\"http://darrenderidder.github.io/talks/ModulePatterns/\">this deck</a>.</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between Bower and npm?", "answer_id": 31633281, "question_id": 18641899, "tags": ["javascript", "npm", "bower"]}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18641899/what-is-the-difference-between-bower-and-npm", "question_id": 18641899}, {"body": "<p>How do you use Auto Layout within <code>UITableViewCell</code>s in a table view to let each cell's content and subviews determine the row height, while maintaining smooth scrolling performance?</p>\n", "title": "Using Auto Layout in UITableView for dynamic cell layouts &amp; variable row heights", "tags": ["ios", "uitableview", "autolayout", "nslayoutconstraint", "nsautolayout"], "answers": [{"body": "<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Don't like reading?

Set Up &amp; Add Constraints</h2>\n\n<p>In your <code>UITableViewCell</code> subclass, add constraints so that the subviews of the cell have their edges pinned to the edges of the cell's <strong>contentView</strong> (most importantly to the top AND bottom edges). <strong>NOTE: don't pin subviews to the cell itself; only to the cell's <code>contentView</code>!</strong> Let the intrinsic content size of these subviews drive the height of the table view cell's content view by making sure the <em>content compression resistance</em> and <em>content hugging</em> constraints in the vertical dimension for each subview are not being overridden by higher-priority constraints you have added. (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22599069/what-is-the-content-compression-resistance-and-content-hugging-of-a-uiview\">Huh? Click here.</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Remember, the idea is to have the cell's subviews connected vertically to the cell's content view so that they can \"exert pressure\" and make the content view expand to fit them. Using an example cell with a few subviews, here is a visual illustration of what <strong>some</strong> <em>(not all!)</em> of your constraints would need to look like:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/CTUPi.png\" alt=\"Example illustration of constraints on a table view cell.\"></p>\n\n<p>You can imagine that as more text is added to the multi-line body label in the example cell above, it will need to grow vertically to fit the text, which will effectively force the cell to grow in height. (Of course, you need to get the constraints right in order for this to work correctly!)</p>\n\n<p>Getting your constraints right is definitely the <strong>hardest and most important part</strong> of getting dynamic cell heights working with Auto Layout. If you make a mistake here, it could prevent everything else from working -- so take your time! I recommend setting up your constraints in code because you know exactly which constraints are being added where, and it's a lot easier to debug when things go wrong. Adding constraints in code is just as easy as and significantly more powerful than Interface Builder when you leverage one of the fantastic open source APIs available -- here is the one I design, maintain, and use exclusively: <a href=\"https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout\">https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you're adding constraints in code, you should do this once from within the <code>updateConstraints</code> method of your UITableViewCell subclass. Note that <code>updateConstraints</code> may be called more than once, so to avoid adding the same constraints more than once, make sure to wrap your constraint-adding code within <code>updateConstraints</code> in a check for a boolean property such as <code>didSetupConstraints</code> (which you set to YES after you run your constraint-adding code once). On the other hand, if you have code that updates existing constraints (such as adjusting the <code>constant</code> property on some constraints), place this in <code>updateConstraints</code> but outside of the check for <code>didSetupConstraints</code> so it can run every time the method is called.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>2. Determine Unique Table View Cell Reuse Identifiers</h2>\n\n<p>For every unique set of constraints in the cell, use a unique cell reuse identifier. In other words, if your cells have more than one unique layout, each unique layout should receive its own reuse identifier. (A good hint that you need to use a new reuse identifier is when your cell variant has a different number of subviews, or the subviews are arranged in a distinct fashion.)</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you were displaying an email message in each cell, you might have 4 unique layouts: messages with just a subject, messages with a subject and a body, messages with a subject and a photo attachment, and messages with a subject, body, and photo attachment. Each layout has completely different constraints required to achieve it, so once the cell is initialized and the constraints are added for one of these cell types, the cell should get a unique reuse identifier specific to that cell type. This means when you dequeue a cell for reuse, the constraints have already been added and are ready to go for that cell type.</p>\n\n<p>Note that due to differences in intrinsic content size, cells with the same constraints (type) may still have varying heights! Don't confuse fundamentally different layouts (different constraints) with different calculated view frames (solved from identical constraints) due to different sizes of content.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not add cells with completely different sets of constraints to the same reuse pool (i.e. use the same reuse identifier) and then attempt to remove the old constraints and set up  new constraints from scratch after each dequeue. The internal Auto Layout engine is not designed to handle large scale changes in constraints, and you will see massive performance issues.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>For iOS 8 - Self-Sizing Cells</h2>\n\n<h3>3. Enable Row Height Estimation</h3>\n\n<p>With iOS 8, Apple has internalized much of the work that previously had to be implemented by you prior to iOS 8. In order to allow the self-sizing cell mechanism to work, you must first set the <code>rowHeight</code> property on the table view to the constant <code>UITableViewAutomaticDimension</code>. Then, you simply need to enable row height estimation by setting the table view's <code>estimatedRowHeight</code> property to a nonzero value, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension;\nself.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 44.0; // set to whatever your \"average\" cell height is\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What this does is provide the table view with a temporary estimate/placeholder for the row heights of cells that are not yet onscreen. Then, when these cells are about to scroll onscreen, the actual row height will be calculated. To determine the actual height for each row, the table view automatically asks each cell what height its <code>contentView</code> needs to be based on the known fixed width of the content view (which is based on the table view's width, minus any additional things like a section index or accessory view) and the auto layout constraints you have added to the cell's content view and subviews. Once this actual cell height has been determined, the old estimated height for the row is updated with the new actual height (and any adjustments to the table view's contentSize/contentOffset are made as needed for you).</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the estimate you provide doesn't have to be very accurate -- it is only used to correctly size the scroll indicator in the table view, and the table view does a good job of adjusting the scroll indicator for incorrect estimates as you scroll cells onscreen. You should set the <code>estimatedRowHeight</code> property on the table view (in <code>viewDidLoad</code> or similar) to a constant value that is the \"average\" row height. <em>Only if your row heights have extreme variability (e.g. differ by an order of magnitude) and you notice the scroll indicator \"jumping\" as you scroll should you bother implementing <code>tableView:estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath:</code> to do the minimal calculation required to return a more accurate estimate for each row.</em></p>\n\n<h2>For iOS 7 support (implementing auto cell sizing yourself)</h2>\n\n<h3>3. Do a Layout Pass &amp; Get The Cell Height</h3>\n\n<p>First, instantiate an offscreen instance of a table view cell, <em>one instance for each reuse identifier</em>, that is used strictly for height calculations. (Offscreen meaning the cell reference is stored in a property/ivar on the view controller and never returned from <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> for the table view to actually render onscreen.) Next, the cell must be configured with the exact content (e.g. text, images, etc) that it would hold if it were to be displayed in the table view.</p>\n\n<p>Then, force the cell to immediately layout its subviews, and then use the <code>systemLayoutSizeFittingSize:</code> method on the <code>UITableViewCell</code>'s <code>contentView</code> to find out what the required height of the cell is. Use <code>UILayoutFittingCompressedSize</code> to get the smallest size required to fit all the contents of the cell. The height can then be returned from the <code>tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:</code> delegate method.</p>\n\n<h3>4. Use Estimated Row Heights</h3>\n\n<p>If your table view has more than a couple dozen rows in it, you will find that doing the Auto Layout constraint solving can quickly bog down the main thread when first loading the table view, as <code>tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:</code> is called on each and every row upon first load (in order to calculate the size of the scroll indicator).</p>\n\n<p>As of iOS 7, you can (and absolutely should) use the <code>estimatedRowHeight</code> property on the table view. What this does is provide the table view with a temporary estimate/placeholder for the row heights of cells that are not yet onscreen. Then, when these cells are about to scroll onscreen, the actual row height will be calculated (by calling <code>tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:</code>), and the estimated height updated with the actual one.</p>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the estimate you provide doesn't have to be very accurate -- it is only used to correctly size the scroll indicator in the table view, and the table view does a good job of adjusting the scroll indicator for incorrect estimates as you scroll cells onscreen. You should set the <code>estimatedRowHeight</code> property on the table view (in <code>viewDidLoad</code> or similar) to a constant value that is the \"average\" row height. <em>Only if your row heights have extreme variability (e.g. differ by an order of magnitude) and you notice the scroll indicator \"jumping\" as you scroll should you bother implementing <code>tableView:estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath:</code> to do the minimal calculation required to return a more accurate estimate for each row.</em></p>\n\n<h3>5. (If Needed) Add Row Height Caching</h3>\n\n<p>If you've done all the above and are still finding that performance is unacceptably slow when doing the constraint solving in <code>tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:</code>, you'll unfortunately need to implement some caching for cell heights. (This is the approach suggested by Apple's engineers.) The general idea is to let the Auto Layout engine solve the constraints the first time, then cache the calculated height for that cell and use the cached value for all future requests for that cell's height. The trick of course is to make sure you clear the cached height for a cell when anything happens that could cause the cell's height to change -- primarily, this would be when that cell's content changes or when other important events occur (like the user adjusting the Dynamic Type text size slider).</p>\n\n<h3>iOS 7 Generic Sample Code (with lots of juicy comments)</h3>\n\n<pre><code>- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath\n{\n    // Determine which reuse identifier should be used for the cell at this \n    // index path, depending on the particular layout required (you may have\n    // just one, or may have many).\n    NSString *reuseIdentifier = ...;\n\n    // Dequeue a cell for the reuse identifier.\n    // Note that this method will init and return a new cell if there isn't\n    // one available in the reuse pool, so either way after this line of \n    // code you will have a cell with the correct constraints ready to go.\n    UITableViewCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:reuseIdentifier];\n\n    // Configure the cell with content for the given indexPath, for example:\n    // cell.textLabel.text = someTextForThisCell;\n    // ...\n\n    // Make sure the constraints have been set up for this cell, since it \n    // may have just been created from scratch.

As @smileyborg mentions, \"your table view cell hasn't yet had its width fixed to the table view's width\".

And that UITableView is complete overkill generally unless you're using some of the advanced row editing features and/or really need to support 1000+ \"rows\" (in our app, it's realistically never more than 20 rows). </p>\n\n<p>The added bonus is that the code gets insanely simple versus all the delegate crap and back and forth that comes with UITableView. It's just one single loop of code in viewOnLoad that looks elegant and is easy to manage.</p>\n\n<p>Here's some tips on how to do it:</p>\n\n<p>1) Using either Storyboard or a nib file, create a ViewController and associated root view.</p>\n\n<p>2) Drag over a UIScrollView onto your root view.</p>\n\n<p>3) Add constraints top, bottom, left and right constraints to the top-level view so the UIScrollView fills the entire root view.</p>\n\n<p>4) Add a UIView inside the UIScrollView and call it \"container\". Add top, bottom, left and right constraints to the UIScrollView (its parent). KEY TRICK: Also add a \"Equal widths\" constraints to link the UIScrollView and UIView.</p>\n\n<p>You will get an error \"scroll view has ambiguous scrollable content height\" and that your container UIView should have a height of 0 pixels. Neither error seems to matter when the app is running.</p>\n\n<p>5) Create nib files and controllers for each of your \"cells\". Use UIView not UITableViewCell.</p>\n\n<p>5) In your root ViewController, you essentially add all the \"rows\" to the container UIView and programmatically add constraints linking their left and right edges to the container view, their top edges to either the container view top (for the first item) or the previous cell. Then link the final cell to the container bottom.</p>\n\n<p>For us, each \"row\" is in a nib file. So the code looks something like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class YourRootViewController {\n\n    @IBOutlet var container: UIView! //container mentioned in step 4\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n\n        var lastView: UIView?\n        for data in yourDataSource {\n\n            var cell = YourCellController(nibName: \"YourCellNibName\", bundle: nil)\n            UITools.addViewToTop(container, child: cell.view, sibling: lastView)\n            lastView = cell.view\n            //Insert code here to populate your cell\n        }\n\n        if(lastView != nil) {\n            container.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(\n                item: lastView!,\n                attribute: NSLayoutAttribute.Bottom,\n                relatedBy: NSLayoutRelation.Equal,\n                toItem: container,\n                attribute: NSLayoutAttribute.Bottom,\n                multiplier: 1,\n                constant: 0))\n        }\n\n        ///Add a refresh control, if you want - it seems to work fine in our app:\n        var refreshControl = UIRefreshControl()\n        container.addSubview(refreshControl!)\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And here's the code for UITools.addViewToTop:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class UITools {\n    ///Add child to container, full width of the container and directly under sibling (or container if sibling nil):\n    class func addViewToTop(container: UIView, child: UIView, sibling: UIView? = nil)\n    {\n        child.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints(false)\n        container.addSubview(child)\n\n        //Set left and right constraints so fills full horz width:\n\n        container.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(\n            item: child,\n            attribute: NSLayoutAttribute.Leading,\n            relatedBy: NSLayoutRelation.Equal,\n            toItem: container,\n            attribute: NSLayoutAttribute.Left,\n            multiplier: 1,\n            constant: 0))\n\n        container.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(\n            item: child,\n            attribute: NSLayoutAttribute.Trailing,\n            relatedBy: NSLayoutRelation.Equal,\n            toItem: container,\n            attribute: NSLayoutAttribute.Right,\n            multiplier: 1,\n            constant: 0))\n\n        //Set vertical position from last item (or for first, from the superview):\n        container.addConstraint(NSLayoutConstraint(\n            item: child,\n            attribute: NSLayoutAttribute.Top,\n            relatedBy: NSLayoutRelation.Equal,\n            toItem: sibling == nil ? container : sibling,\n            attribute: sibling == nil ? NSLayoutAttribute.Top : NSLayoutAttribute.Bottom,\n            multiplier: 1,\n            constant: 0))\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The only \"gotcha\" I've found with this approach so far is that UITableView has a nice feature of \"floating\" section headers at the top of the view as you scroll. The above solution won't do that unless you add more programming but for our particular case this feature wasn't 100% essential and nobody noticed when it went away.</p>\n\n<p>If you want dividers between your cells, just add a 1 pixel high UIView at the bottom of your custom \"cell\" that looks like a divider.</p>\n\n<p>Be sure to turn on \"bounces\" and \"bounce vertically\" for the refresh control to work and so it seems more like a tableview.</p>\n\n<p>TableView shows some empty rows and dividers under your content, if it doesn't fill the full screen where as this solution doesn't. But personally, I prefer if those empty rows weren't there anyway - with variable cell height it always looked \"buggy\" to me anyway to have the empty rows in there.</p>\n\n<p>Here's hoping some other programmer reads my post BEFORE wasting 20+ hours trying to figure it out with Table View in their own app. :)</p>\n", "title": "Using Auto Layout in UITableView for dynamic cell layouts &amp; variable row heights", "answer_id": 30835127, "question_id": 18746929, "tags": ["ios", "uitableview", "autolayout", "nslayoutconstraint", "nsautolayout"]}, {"body": "<p>For IOS8 is really simple:</p>\n\n<pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() \n{  \n    super.viewDidLoad()\n\n    self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 80\n    self.tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>OR </p>\n\n<pre><code>func tableView(tableView: UITableView, heightForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; CGFloat \n{\n    return UITableViewAutomaticDimension\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>But for IOS7, the key is calculate the height after autolayout,</p>\n\n<pre><code>func calculateHeightForConfiguredSizingCell(cell: GSTableViewCell) -&gt; CGFloat  \n{\n    cell.setNeedsLayout()\n    cell.layoutIfNeeded()\n    let height = cell.contentView.systemLayoutSizeFittingSize(UILayoutFittingExpandedSize).height + 1.0\n    return height\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Important</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If multiple lines labels, don't forget set the numberOfLines to <code>0</code>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't forget <code>label.preferredMaxLayoutWidth = CGRectGetWidth(tableView.bounds)</code></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The full example code is <a href=\"https://github.com/williamhqs/GSTableViewDynamicHeight\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n", "title": "Using Auto Layout in UITableView for dynamic cell layouts &amp; variable row heights", "answer_id": 30933372, "question_id": 18746929, "tags": ["ios", "uitableview", "autolayout", "nslayoutconstraint", "nsautolayout"]}, {"body": "<p>I had to use dynamic views (setup views and constraints by code) and when I wanted to set preferredMaxLayoutWidth label's width was 0.

Make sure that you get everything pinned right so that auto layout can determine the correct height to use. You may also have to use vertical compression resistance and hugging.

For example, if you had added a Center Horizontally constraint to the label in the project above rather than pin the leading and trailing edges, then you would need to add this line to the <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> method:</p>\n\n<pre><code> cell.myCellLabel.preferredMaxLayoutWidth = tableView.bounds.width\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>See also</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.appcoda.com/self-sizing-cells/\">Understanding Self Sizing Cells and Dynamic Type in iOS 8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://useyourloaf.com/blog/table-view-cells-with-varying-row-heights/\">Table View Cells with Varying Row Heights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33234180/uitableview-example-for-swift\">UITableView example for Swift</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Using Auto Layout in UITableView for dynamic cell layouts &amp; variable row heights", "answer_id": 36422189, "question_id": 18746929, "tags": ["ios", "uitableview", "autolayout", "nslayoutconstraint", "nsautolayout"]}, {"body": "<p>In my case i have to create a custom cell with a image which is coming from server and can be of any width and height.

When you build for production, along with minifying and combining your JavaScript files, you generate a source map which holds information about your original files. When you query a certain line and column number in your generated JavaScript you can do a lookup in the source map which returns the original location. Developer tools (currently WebKit nightly builds, Google Chrome, or Firefox 23+) can parse the source map automatically and make it appear as though you're running unminified and uncombined files. \n(Read more on this <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/\">here</a>)</p>\n", "title": "jQuery&#39;s jquery-1.10.2.min.map is triggering a 404 (Not Found)", "answer_id": 18478684, "question_id": 18365315, "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "google-chrome-devtools"]}, {"body": "<p>The new versions of jQuery require this file <a href=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.map\">http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.map</a></p>\n\n<p>The usability of this file is described here <a href=\"http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/\">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>jQuery 1.11.0/2.1.0</em></p>\n\n<p>// sourceMappingURL comment <strong>is not included in the compressed file</strong>.</p>\n", "title": "jQuery&#39;s jquery-1.10.2.min.map is triggering a 404 (Not Found)", "answer_id": 18986635, "question_id": 18365315, "tags": ["javascript", "jquery", "google-chrome-devtools"]}, {"body": "<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://jquery.com/download/\">Download</a> the map file and the uncompressed version of jQuery.

However, in some cases the <em>factory</em> gives you a little bit more flexibility to create an injectable with a simpler syntax. That's because while myInjectedService must always be an object, myInjectedFactory can be an object, a function reference, or any value at all. For example, if you wrote a service to create a constructor (as in the last example above), it would have to be instantiated like so: </p>\n\n<pre><code>var myShinyNewObject = new myInjectedService.myFunction()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which is arguably less desirable than this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>var myShinyNewObject = new myInjectedFactory();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(But you should be wary about using this type of pattern in the first place because <em>new</em>-ing objects in your controllers creates hard-to-track dependencies that are difficult to mock for testing. Better to have a service manage a collection of objects for you than use <code>new()</code> wily-nilly.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>One more thing, they are all Singletons...</h3>\n\n<p>Also keep in mind that in both cases, angular is helping you manage a singleton. Regardless of where or how many times you inject your service or function, you will get the same reference to the same object or function. (With the exception of when a factory simply returns a value like a number or string. In that case, you will always get the same value, but not a reference.)</p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "answer_id": 21900284, "question_id": 14324451, "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <br><br>\n<strong>1)</strong> When you\u2019re using a <strong>Factory</strong> you create an object, add properties to it, then return that same object.

We then resolve our promise with the iTunes data, or we reject it with a message saying \u2018There was an error\u2019.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.factory('myFactory', function($http, $q){\n  var service = {};\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  service.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  service.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  service.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n  return service;\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now our factory is complete. We are now able to inject \u2018myFactory\u2019 into any controller and we\u2019ll then be able to call our methods that we attached to our service object (setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes). </p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myFactoryCtrl', function($scope, myFactory){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myFactory.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In the controller above we\u2019re injecting in the \u2018myFactory\u2019 service. We then set properties on our $scope object that are coming from data from \u2018myFactory\u2019. The only tricky code above is if you\u2019ve never dealt with promises before. Because callItunes is returning a promise, we are able to use the .then() method and only set $scope.data.artistData once our promise is fulfilled with the iTunes data. You\u2019ll notice our controller is very \u2018thin\u2019. All of our logic and persistent data is located in our service, not in our controller. \n<br><br>\n<strong>2) Service</strong> <br>\nPerhaps the biggest thing to know when dealing with creating a Service is that  that it\u2019s instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. For you JavaScript gurus this should give you a big hint into the nature of the code. For those of  you with a limited background in JavaScript or for those who aren\u2019t too familiar with what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword actually does, let\u2019s review some JavaScript fundamentals that will eventually help us in understanding the nature of a Service. </p>\n\n<p>To really see the changes that occur when you invoke a function with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, let\u2019s create a function and invoke it with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, then let\u2019s show what the interpreter does when it sees the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. The end results will both be the same.</p>\n\n<p>First let\u2019s create our Constructor. </p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is a typical JavaScript constructor function. Now whenever we invoke the Person function using the \u2018new\u2019 keyword, \u2018this\u2019 will be bound to the newly created object. </p>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s add a method onto our Person\u2019s prototype so it will be available on every instance of our Person \u2018class\u2019. </p>\n\n<pre><code>Person.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert('My name is ' + this.name);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, because we put the sayName function on the prototype, every instance of Person will be able to call the sayName function in order alert that instance\u2019s name.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we have our Person constructor function and our sayName function on its prototype, let\u2019s actually create an instance of Person then call the sayName function. </p>\n\n<pre><code>var tyler = new Person('Tyler', 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts 'My name is Tyler'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So all together the code for creating a Person constructor, adding a function to it\u2019s prototype, creating a Person instance, and then calling the function on its prototype looks like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n}\nPerson.prototype.sayName = function(){\n  alert('My name is ' + this.name);\n}\nvar tyler = new Person('Tyler', 23);\ntyler.sayName(); //alerts 'My name is Tyler'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now let\u2019s look at what actually is happening when you use the \u2018new\u2019 keyword in JavaScript. First thing you should notice is that after using \u2018new\u2019 in our example, we\u2019re able to call a method (sayName) on \u2018tyler\u2019 just as if it were an object - that\u2019s because it is. So first, we know that our Person constructor is returning an object, whether we can see that in the code or not. Second, we know that because our sayName function is located on the prototype and not directly on the Person instance, the object that the Person function is returning must be delegating to its prototype on failed lookups. In more simple terms, when we call tyler.sayName() the interpreter says \u201cOK, I\u2019m going to look on the \u2018tyler\u2019 object we just created, locate the sayName function, then call it. Wait a minute, I don\u2019t see it here - all I see is name and age, let me check the prototype. Yup, looks like it\u2019s on the prototype, let me call it.\u201d. </p>\n\n<p>Below is code for how you can think about what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword is actually doing in JavaScript. It\u2019s basically a code example of the above paragraph. I\u2019ve put the \u2018interpreter view\u2019 or the way the interpreter sees the code inside of notes.</p>\n\n<pre><code>var Person = function(name, age){\n  //The line below this creates an obj object that will delegate to the person's prototype on failed lookups.\n  //var obj = Object.create(Person.prototype);\n\n  //The line directly below this sets 'this' to the newly created object\n  //this = obj;\n\n  this.name = name;\n  this.age = age;\n\n  //return this;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now having this knowledge of what the \u2018new\u2019 keyword really does in JavaScript, creating a Service in Angular should be easier to understand. </p>\n\n<p>The biggest thing to understand when creating a Service is knowing that Services are instantiated with the \u2018new\u2019 keyword. Combining that knowledge with our examples above, you should now recognize that you\u2019ll be attaching your properties and methods directly to \u2018this\u2019 which will then be returned from the Service itself. Let\u2019s take a look at this in action. </p>\n\n<p>Unlike what we originally did with the Factory example, we don\u2019t need to create an object then return that object because, like mentioned many times before, we used the \u2018new\u2019 keyword so the interpreter will create that object, have it delegate to it\u2019s prototype, then return it for us without us having to do the work. </p>\n\n<p>First things first, let\u2019s create our \u2018private\u2019 and helper function. This should look very familiar since we did the exact same thing with our factory. I won\u2019t explain what each line does here because I did that in the factory example, if you\u2019re confused, re-read the factory example.</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, we\u2019ll attach all of our methods that will be available in our controller to \u2018this\u2019. </p>\n\n<pre><code>app.service('myService', function($http, $q){\n  var baseUrl = 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=';\n  var _artist = '';\n  var _finalUrl = '';\n\n  var makeUrl = function(){\n    _artist = _artist.split(' ').join('+');\n    _finalUrl = baseUrl + _artist + '&amp;callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n    return _finalUrl;\n  }\n\n  this.setArtist = function(artist){\n    _artist = artist;\n  }\n\n  this.getArtist = function(){\n    return _artist;\n  }\n\n  this.callItunes = function(){\n    makeUrl();\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    $http({\n      method: 'JSONP',\n      url: _finalUrl\n    }).success(function(data){\n      deferred.resolve(data);\n    }).error(function(){\n      deferred.reject('There was an error')\n    })\n    return deferred.promise;\n  }\n\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now just like in our factory, setArtist, getArtist, and callItunes will be available in whichever controller we pass myService into. Here\u2019s the myService controller (which is almost exactly the same as our factory controller).</p>\n\n<pre><code>app.controller('myServiceCtrl', function($scope, myService){\n  $scope.data = {};\n  $scope.updateArtist = function(){\n    myService.setArtist($scope.data.artist);\n  };\n\n  $scope.submitArtist = function(){\n    myService.callItunes()\n      .then(function(data){\n        $scope.data.artistData = data;\n      }, function(data){\n        alert(data);\n      })\n  }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Like I mentioned before, once you really understand what \u2018new\u2019 does, Services are almost identical to factories in Angular. </p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "answer_id": 23659951, "question_id": 14324451, "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"]}, {"body": "<h3>app.factory('fn', fn) vs. app.service('fn',fn)</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>\n\n<p>With factories, Angular will invoke the function to get the result.

They are injected into a controllers, directives, run block, etc, and used in client code in pretty much the same way. They are also both singletons - meaning the same instance is shared between all places where the service/factory is injected.  </p>\n\n<p>So which should you prefer?  Either one - they are so similar that the differences are trivial.  If you do choose one over the other, just be aware how they are constructed, so that you can implement them properly.</p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "answer_id": 24442224, "question_id": 14324451, "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"]}, {"body": "<h1>The clue is in the name</h1>\n\n<p>Services and factories are similar to one another. Both will yield a singleton object that can be injected into other objects, and so are often used interchangeably.</p>\n\n<p>They are intended to be used semantically to implement different design patterns.</p>\n\n<h2>Services are for implementing a service pattern</h2>\n\n<p>A service pattern is one in which your application is broken into logically consistent units of functionality. An example might be an API accessor, or a set of business logic.</p>\n\n<p>This is especially important in Angular because Angular models are typically just JSON objects pulled from a server, and so we need somewhere to put our business logic.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a Github service for example. It knows how to talk to Github. It knows about urls and methods. We can inject it into a controller, and it will generate and return a promise.</p>\n\n<pre><code>(function() {\n  var base = \"https://api.github.com\";\n\n  angular.module('github', [])\n    .service('githubService', function( $http ) {\n      this.getEvents: function() {\n        var url = [\n          base,\n          '/events',\n          '?callback=JSON_CALLBACK'\n        ].join('');\n        return $http.jsonp(url);\n      }\n    });\n  )();\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Factories implement a factory pattern</h2>\n\n<p>Factories, on the other hand are intended to implement a factory pattern. A factory pattern in one in which we use a factory function to generate an object. Typically we might use this for building models. Here is a factory which returns an Author constructor:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('user', [])\n  .factory('User', function($resource) {\n    var url = 'http://simple-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/authors/:id'\n    return $resource(url);\n  })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>We would make use of this like so:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('app', ['user'])\n  .controller('authorController', function($scope, User) {\n    $scope.user = new User();\n  })\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that factories also return singletons.</p>\n\n<h2>Factories can return a constructor</h2>\n\n<p>Because a factory simply returns an object, it can return any type of object you like, including a constructor function, as we see above.</p>\n\n<h2>Factories return an object; services are newable</h2>\n\n<p>Another technical difference is in the way services and factories are composed. A service function will be newed to generate the object. A factory function will be called and will return the object.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Services are newable constructors.</li>\n<li>Factories are simply called and return an object.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This means that in a service, we append to \"this\" which, in the context of a constructor, will point to the object under construction.</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate this, here is the same simple object created using a service and a factory:</p>\n\n<pre><code>angular.module('app', [])\n  .service('helloService', function() {\n    this.sayHello = function() {\n      return \"Hello!\";\n    }\n  })\n  .factory('helloFactory', function() {\n    return {\n      sayHello: function() {\n        return \"Hello!\";\n      }\n    }\n  });\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "answer_id": 27545899, "question_id": 14324451, "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"]}, {"body": "<p>I have spent some time trying to figure out the difference.</p>\n\n<p>And i think the factory function uses the module pattern and service function uses the standard java script constructor pattern. </p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "answer_id": 28967162, "question_id": 14324451, "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"]}, {"body": "<p>The factory pattern is more flexible as it can return functions and values as well as objects.</p>\n\n<p>There isn't a lot of point in the service pattern IMHO, as everything it does you can just as easily do with a factory. The exceptions might be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you care about the declared type of your instantiated service for some reason - if you use the service pattern, your constructor will be the type of the new service.</li>\n<li>If you already have a constructor function that you're using elsewhere that you also want to use as a service (although probably not much use if you want to inject anything into it!).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Arguably, the service pattern is a <em>slightly</em> nicer way to create a new object from a syntax point of view, but it's also more costly to instantiate. Others have indicated that angular uses \"new\" to create the service, but this isn't quite true - it isn't able to do that because every service constructor has a different number of parameters. What angular actually does is use the factory pattern internally to wrap your constructor function. Then it does some clever jiggery pokery to <em>simulate</em> javascript's \"new\" operator, invoking your constructor with a variable number of injectable arguments - but you can leave out this step if you just use the factory pattern directly, thus very slightly increasing the efficiency of your code.</p>\n", "title": "angular.service vs angular.factory", "answer_id": 31859058, "question_id": 14324451, "tags": ["angularjs", "angular-services"]}, {"body": "<p>All the answers here seem to be around service and factory, and that's valid since that was what was being asked about.

Every 64th character, it outputs a newline. Otherwise, it uses a pair of data tables to figure out what to output, and puts either character 32 (a space) or character 33 (a <code>!</code>). The first table (<code>\"&gt;'txiZ^(~z?\"</code>) is a set of 10 bitmaps describing the appearance of each character, and the second table (<code>\";;;====~$::199\"</code>) selects the appropriate bit to display from the bitmap.</p>\n\n<h3>The second table</h3>\n\n<p>Let's start by examining the second table, <code>int shift = \";;;====~$::199\"[(i*2&amp;8) | (i/64)];</code>. <code>i/64</code> is the line number (6 to 0) and <code>i*2&amp;8</code> is 8 iff <code>i</code> is 4, 5, 6 or 7 mod 8.</p>\n\n<p><code>if((i &amp; 2) == 0) shift /= 8; shift = shift % 8</code> selects either the high octal digit (for <code>i%8</code> = 0,1,4,5) or the low octal digit (for <code>i%8</code> = 2,3,6,7) of the table value. The shift table ends up looking like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>row col val\n6   6-7 0\n6   4-5 0\n6   2-3 5\n6   0-1 7\n5   6-7 1\n5   4-5 7\n5   2-3 5\n5   0-1 7\n4   6-7 1\n4   4-5 7\n4   2-3 5\n4   0-1 7\n3   6-7 1\n3   4-5 6\n3   2-3 5\n3   0-1 7\n2   6-7 2\n2   4-5 7\n2   2-3 3\n2   0-1 7\n1   6-7 2\n1   4-5 7\n1   2-3 3\n1   0-1 7\n0   6-7 4\n0   4-5 4\n0   2-3 3\n0   0-1 7\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or in tabular form</p>\n\n<pre><code>00005577\n11775577\n11775577\n11665577\n22773377\n22773377\n44443377\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that the author used the null terminator for the first two table entries (sneaky!).</p>\n\n<p>This is designed after a seven-segment display, with <code>7</code>s as blanks. So, the entries in the first table must define the segments that get lit up.</p>\n\n<h3>The first table</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Standard-Predefined-Macros.html\"><code>__TIME__</code></a> is a special macro defined by the preprocessor. It expands to a string constant containing the time at which the preprocessor was run, in the form <code>\"HH:MM:SS\"</code>. Observe that it contains exactly 8 characters. Note that 0-9 have ASCII values 48 through 57 and <code>:</code> has ASCII value 58. The output is 64 characters per line, so that leaves 8 characters per character of <code>__TIME__</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>7 - i/8%8</code> is thus the index of <code>__TIME__</code> that is presently being output (the <code>7-</code> is needed because we are iterating <code>i</code> downwards). So, <code>t</code> is the character of <code>__TIME__</code> being output.</p>\n\n<p><code>a</code> ends up equalling the following in binary, depending on the input <code>t</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0 00111111\n1 00101000\n2 01110101\n3 01111001\n4 01101010\n5 01011011\n6 01011111\n7 00101001\n8 01111111\n9 01111011\n: 01000000\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Each number is a <em>bitmap</em> describing the segments that are lit up in our seven-segment display. Since the characters are all 7-bit ASCII, the high bit is always cleared. Thus, <code>7</code> in the segment table always prints as a blank. The second table looks like this with the <code>7</code>s as blanks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>000055  \n11  55  \n11  55  \n116655  \n22  33  \n22  33  \n444433  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, for example, <code>4</code> is <code>01101010</code> (bits 1, 3, 5, and 6 set), which prints as</p>\n\n<pre><code>----!!--\n!!--!!--\n!!--!!--\n!!!!!!--\n----!!--\n----!!--\n----!!--\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>To show we really understand the code, let's adjust the output a bit with this table:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  00  \n11  55\n11  55\n  66  \n22  33\n22  33\n  44\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is encoded as <code>\"?;;?==? '::799\\x07\"</code>. For artistic purposes, we'll add 64 to a few of the characters (since only the low 6 bits are used, this won't affect the output); this gives <code>\"?{{?}}?gg::799G\"</code> (note that the 8th character is unused, so we can actually make it whatever we want). Putting our new table in the original code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>main(_){_^448&amp;&amp;main(-~_);putchar(--_%64?32|-~7[__TIME__-_/8%8][\"&gt;'txiZ^(~z?\"-48]&gt;&gt;\"?{{?}}?gg::799G\"[_*2&amp;8|_/64]/(_&amp;2?1:8)%8&amp;1:10);}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>we get</p>\n\n<pre><code>          !!              !!                              !!   \n    !!  !!              !!  !!  !!  !!              !!  !!  !! \n    !!  !!              !!  !!  !!  !!              !!  !!  !! \n          !!      !!              !!      !!                   \n    !!  !!  !!          !!  !!      !!              !!  !!  !! \n    !!  !!  !!          !!  !!      !!              !!  !!  !! \n          !!              !!                              !!   \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>just as we expected. It's not as solid-looking as the original, which explains why the author chose to use the table he did.</p>\n", "title": "Obfuscated C Code Contest 2006.

Let's focus on the blob in the middle:</p>\n\n<pre><code>-(~(7[__TIME__-argc/8%8][\"&gt;'txiZ^(~z?\"-48]) &gt;&gt;\n     (\";;;====~$::199\"[argc*2&amp;8|argc/64]) / (argc&amp;2?1:8) % 8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As another poster said, <code>__TIME__</code> is the compile time for the program, and is a string, so there's some string arithmetic going on, as well as taking advantage of an array subscript being bidirectional:  a[b] is the same as b[a] for character arrays.</p>\n\n<pre><code>7[__TIME__ - (argc/8)%8]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will select one of the first 8 characters in <code>__TIME__</code>.  This is then indexed into <code>[\"&gt;'txiZ^(~z?\"-48]</code> (0-9 characters are 48-57 decimal).  The characters in this string must have been chosen for their ASCII values.  This same character ASCII code manipulation continues through the expression, to result in the printing of either a ' ' or '!' depending on the location within the character's glyph.</p>\n", "title": "Obfuscated C Code Contest 2006.

Anyway, there's no need, given that pip is now <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/2.7//installing/index.html\">included with Python as of 2.7.9</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that pip isn't the only package manager for Python. There's also easy_install. It's no good to mix the two, so don't do it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you have both Python 2 and 3 installed, <em>pip</em> will point to whichever Python you installed last. Get in the habit of explicitly using either <em>pip2</em> or <em>pip3</em>, so you're sure which Python is getting the new library.</p>\n\n<p>Happy hacking!</p>\n", "title": "Installing pip on Mac OS X", "answer_id": 28974427, "question_id": 17271319, "tags": ["python", "osx", "pip"]}, {"body": "<p>It's Easy (On Mac):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Install easy_install</p>\n\n<pre><code>curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | sudo python\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Install pip</p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo easy_install pip\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Now, you could install external modules.

If you get, like I do on Trusty, <code>/usr</code>, you might want to change it to a folder that you can safely own without messing things up the way I did.</p>\n\n<p>To do that, choose or create a new folder in your system. You may want to have it in your home directory or, like me, under <code>/usr/local</code> for consistency because I'm also a Mac user (I prefer not to need to look into different places depending on the machine I happen to be in front of). Another good reason to do that is the fact that the <code>/usr/local</code> folder is probably already in your PATH (unless you like to mess around with your PATH) but chances are your newly-created folder isn't and you'd need to add it to the PATH yourself on your <em>.bash-profile</em> or <em>.bashrc</em> file.</p>\n\n<p>Long story short, I changed the default location of the global modules with <code>npm config set prefix '/usr/local'</code>, created the folder <code>/usr/local/lib/node_modules</code> (it will be used by npm) and changed permissions for the folders used by npm with the command: </p>\n\n<pre><code>sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(npm config get prefix)/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can globally install any module safely.

There was no official language standard back then (beyond the reference material at the back of the first edition of K&amp;R), and C code of any complexity was typically a complex maze of <code>#ifdef</code>s to allow for differences between systems. These macro definitions were generally set by the compiler itself, not defined in a library header file. Since there were no real rules about which identifiers could be used by the implementation and which were reserved for programmers, compiler writers felt free to use simple names like <code>unix</code> and assumed that programmers would simply avoid using those names for their own purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The 1989 ANSI C standard introduced rules restricting what symbols an implementation could legally predefine. A macro predefined by the compiler could only have a name starting with two underscores, or with an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, leaving programmers free to use identifiers not matching that pattern and not used in the standard library.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, any compiler that predefines <code>unix</code> or <code>linux</code> is non-conforming, since it will fail to compile perfectly legal code that uses something like <code>int linux = 5;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>As it happens, gcc is non-conforming by default -- but it can be made to conform (reasonably well) with the right command-line options:</p>\n\n<pre><code>gcc -std=c90 -pedantic ... # or -std=c89 or -ansi\ngcc -std=c99 -pedantic\ngcc -std=c11 -pedantic\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.1/gcc/Standards.html\">the gcc manual</a> for more details.</p>\n\n<p>gcc will be phasing out these definitions in future releases, so you shouldn't write code that depends on them.

So if you have <code>$scope.myVar</code> defined in your controller and this variable was <strong>marked for being watched</strong>, then you are implicitly telling AngularJS to monitor the changes on <code>myVar</code> in each iteration of the loop.</p>\n\n<p>A natural follow-up question would be: Is everything attached to <code>$scope</code> being watched? Fortunately, no. If you would watch for changes to every object in your <code>$scope</code>, then quickly a digest loop would take ages to evaluate and you would quickly run into performance issues. That is why the AngularJS team gave us two ways of declaring some <code>$scope</code> variable as being watched (read below).</p>\n\n<h2>$watch helps to listen for $scope changes</h2>\n\n<p>There are two ways of declaring a <code>$scope</code> variable as being watched.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>By using it in your template via the expression <code>&lt;span&gt;{{myVar}}&lt;/span&gt;</code></li>\n<li>By adding it manually via the <code>$watch</code> service</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Ad 1)\nThis is the most common scenario and I'm sure you've seen it before, but you didn't know that this has created a watch in the background. Yes, it had! Using AngularJS directives (such as <code>ng-repeat</code>) can also create implicit watches.</p>\n\n<p>Ad 2)\nThis is how you create your own <strong>watches</strong>. <code>$watch</code> service helps you to run some code when some value attached to the <code>$scope</code> has changed. It is rarely used, but sometimes is helpful. For instance, if you want to run some code each time 'myVar' changes, you could do the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>function MyController($scope) {\n\n    $scope.myVar = 1;\n\n    $scope.$watch('myVar', function() {\n        alert('hey, myVar has changed!');\n    });\n\n    $scope.buttonClicked = function() {\n        $scope.myVar = 2; // This will trigger $watch expression to kick in\n    };\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>$apply enables to integrate changes with the digest cycle</h2>\n\n<p>You can think of the <strong><code>$apply</code> function as of an integration mechanism</strong>. You see, each time you change some <strong>watched variable attached to the <code>$scope</code></strong> object directly, AngularJS will know that the change has happened. This is because AngularJS already knew to monitor those changes. So if it happens in code managed by the framework, the digest cycle will carry on.</p>\n\n<p>However, sometimes you want to <strong>change some value outside of the AngularJS world</strong> and see the changes propagate normally.\nConsider this - you have a <code>$scope.myVar</code> value which will be modified within a jQuery's <code>$.ajax()</code> handler. This will happen at some point in future. AngularJS can't wait for this to happen, since it hasn't been instructed to wait on jQuery.</p>\n\n<p>To tackle this, <code>$apply</code> has been introduced. It lets you to start the digestion cycle explicitly. However, you should only use this to migrate some data to AngularJS (integration with other frameworks), but never use this method combined with regular AngularJS code, as AngularJS will throw an error then.</p>\n\n<h2>How is all of this related to the DOM?</h2>\n\n<p>Well, you should really follow the tutorial again, now that you know all this. The digest cycle will make sure that the UI and the JavaScript code stays synchronised, by evaluating every watcher attached to the all <code>$scope</code>s as long as nothing changes. If no more changes happen in the digest loop, then it's considered to be finished.</p>\n\n<p>You can attach objects to the <code>$scope</code> object either explicitly in the Controller, or by declaring them in <code>{{expression}}</code> form directly in the view.</p>\n\n<p>I hope that helps to clarify some basic knowledge about all this.</p>\n\n<p>Further readings:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em><a href=\"http://teropa.info/blog/2013/11/03/make-your-own-angular-part-1-scopes-and-digest.html\">Make Your Own AngularJS, Part 1: Scopes And Digest</a></em> (awesome article!)</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "Using $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply in AngularJS", "answer_id": 15113029, "question_id": 15112584, "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-scope"]}, {"body": "<p>In AngularJS, we update our models, and our views/templates update the DOM \"automatically\" (via built-in or custom directives).</p>\n\n<p>$apply and $watch, both being Scope methods, are not related to the DOM.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts\">Concepts</a> page (section \"Runtime\") has a pretty good explanation of the $digest loop, $apply, the $evalAsync queue and the $watch list.

This evaluation happens whenever AngularJS enters its $digest loop (in particular, the \"$watch list\" loop). You can watch individual scope properties, you can define a function to watch two properties together, you can watch the length of an array, etc.</p>\n\n<p>When things happen \"inside AngularJS\" &ndash; e.g., you type into a textbox that has AngularJS two-way databinding enabled (i.e., uses ng-model), an $http callback fires, etc. &ndash; $apply has already been called, so we're inside the \"AngularJS\" rectangle in the figure above. All watchExpressions will be evaluated (possibly more than once &ndash; until no further changes are detected).</p>\n\n<p>When things happen \"outside AngularJS\" &ndash; e.g., you used bind() in a directive and then that event fires, resulting in your callback being called, or some jQuery registered callback fires &ndash; we're still in the \"Native\" rectangle.

Specifically, <code>$watchGroup</code> is really helpful if you want to call a function to update an object which has multiple properties in a view that is not dom object, for e.g. other view in canvas, webGL or server request.

Understanding <code>$watch()</code>, <code>$digest()</code> and <code>$apply()</code> is essential in order to understand AngularJS.</p>\n\n<p>When you create a data binding from somewhere in your view to a variable on the $scope object, AngularJS creates a \"watch\" internally. A watch means that AngularJS watches changes in the variable on the <code>$scope object</code>. The framework is \"watching\" the variable. Watches are created using the <code>$scope.$watch()</code> function which I will cover later in this text.</p>\n\n<p>At key points in your application AngularJS calls the <code>$scope.$digest()</code> function. This function iterates through all watches and checks if any of the watched variables have changed. If a watched variable has changed, a corresponding listener function is called. The listener function does whatever work it needs to do, for instance changing an HTML text to reflect the new value of the watched variable. Thus, the <code>$digest()</code> function is what triggers the data binding to update.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the time AngularJS will call the $scope.$watch() and <code>$scope.$digest()</code> functions for you, but in some situations you may have to call them yourself. Therefore it is really good to know how they work.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.$apply()</code> function is used to execute some code, and then call <code>$scope.$digest()</code> after that, so all watches are checked and the corresponding watch listener functions are called. The <code>$apply()</code> function is useful when integrating AngularJS with other code.</p>\n\n<p>I will get into more detail about the <code>$watch(), $digest()</code> and <code>$apply()</code> functions in the remainder of this text. </p>\n\n<h2>$watch()</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.watch()</code> function creates a watch of some variable. When you register a watch you pass two functions as parameters to the <code>$watch()</code> function:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A value function</li>\n<li>A listener function</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here is an example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$watch(function() {},\n              function() {}\n             );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first function is the value function and the second function is the listener function.</p>\n\n<p>The value function should return the value which is being watched. AngularJS can then check the value returned against the value the watch function returned the last time. That way AngularJS can determine if the value has changed. Here is an example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$watch(function(scope) { return scope.data.myVar },\n              function() {}\n             );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This example valule function returns the <code>$scope</code> variable <code>scope.data.myVar</code>. If the value of this variable changes, a different value will be returned, and AngularJS will call the listener function.</p>\n\n<p>Notice how the value function takes the scope as parameter (without the $ in the name). Via this parameter the value function can access the <code>$scope</code> and its variables. The value function can also watch global variables instead if you need that, but most often you will watch a <code>$scope</code> variable.</p>\n\n<p>The listener function should do whatever it needs to do if the value has changed. Perhaps you need to change the content of another variable, or set the content of an HTML element or something. Here is an example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$watch(function(scope) { return scope.data.myVar },\n              function(newValue, oldValue) {\n                  document.getElementById(\"\").innerHTML =\n                      \"\" + newValue + \"\";\n              }\n             );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This example sets the inner HTML of an HTML element to the new value of the variable, embedded in the b element which makes the value bold. Of course you could have done this using the code <code>{{ data.myVar }</code>, but this is just an example of what you can do inside the listener function.</p>\n\n<h2>$digest()</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.$digest()</code> function iterates through all the watches in the <code>$scope object</code>, and its child $scope objects (if it has any). When <code>$digest()</code> iterates over the watches, it calls the value function for each watch. If the value returned by the value function is different than the value it returned the last time it was called, the listener function for that watch is called.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>$digest()</code> function is called whenever AngularJS thinks it is necessary. For instance, after a button click handler has been executed, or after an <code>AJAX</code> call returns (after the done() / fail() callback function has been executed).</p>\n\n<p>You may encounter some corner cases where AngularJS does not call the <code>$digest()</code> function for you. You will usually detect that by noticing that the data bindings do not update the displayed values. In that case, call <code>$scope.$digest()</code> and it should work. Or, you can perhaps use <code>$scope.$apply()</code> instead which I will explain in the next section. </p>\n\n<h2>$apply()</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>$scope.$apply()</code> function takes a function as parameter which is executed, and after that <code>$scope.$digest()</code> is called internally. That makes it easier for you to make sure that all watches are checked, and thus all data bindings refreshed. Here is an <code>$apply()</code> example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>$scope.$apply(function() {\n    $scope.data.myVar = \"Another value\";\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The function passed to the <code>$apply()</code> function as parameter will change the value of <code>$scope.data.myVar</code>. When the function exits AngularJS will call the <code>$scope.$digest()</code> function so all watches are checked for changes in the watched values. </p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>To illustrate how <code>$watch()</code>, <code>$digest(</code>) and <code>$apply()</code> works, look at this example: </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=\"myController\"&gt;\n    {{data.time}}\n\n    &lt;br/&gt;\n    &lt;button ng-click=\"updateTime()\"&gt;update time - ng-click&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;button id=\"updateTimeButton\"  &gt;update time&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n    var module       = angular.module(\"myapp\", []);\n    var myController1 = module.controller(\"myController\", function($scope) {\n\n        $scope.data = { time : new Date() };\n\n        $scope.updateTime = function() {\n            $scope.data.time = new Date();\n        }\n\n        document.getElementById(\"updateTimeButton\")\n                .addEventListener('click', function() {\n            console.log(\"update time clicked\");\n            $scope.data.time = new Date();\n        });\n    });\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>his example binds the <code>$scope.data.time</code> variable to an interpolation directive which merges the variable value into the HTML page. This binding creates a watch internally on the <code>$scope.data.time variable</code>.</p>\n\n<p>The example also contains two buttons. The first button has an <code>ng-click</code> listener attached to it. When that button is clicked the <code>$scope.updateTime()</code> function is called, and after that AngularJS calls <code>$scope.$digest()</code> so that data bindings are updated.</p>\n\n<p>The second button gets a standard JavaScript event listener attached to it from inside the controller function. When the second button is clicked that listener function is executed. As you can see, the listener functions for both buttons do almost the same, but when the second button's listener function is called, the data binding is not updated. That is because the <code>$scope.$digest()</code> is not called after the second button's event listener is executed. Thus, if you click the second button the time is updated in the <code>$scope.data.time</code> variable, but the new time is never displayed.</p>\n\n<p>To fix that we can add a <code>$scope.$digest()</code> call to the last line of the button event listener, like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>document.getElementById(\"updateTimeButton\")\n        .addEventListener('click', function() {\n    console.log(\"update time clicked\");\n    $scope.data.time = new Date();\n    $scope.$digest();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Instead of calling <code>$digest()</code> inside the button listener function you could also have used the <code>$apply()</code> function like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>document.getElementById(\"updateTimeButton\")\n        .addEventListener('click', function() {\n    $scope.$apply(function() {\n        console.log(\"update time clicked\");\n        $scope.data.time = new Date();\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Notice how the <code>$scope.$apply()</code> function is called from inside the button event listener, and how the update of the <code>$scope.data.time</code> variable is performed inside the function passed as parameter to the <code>$apply()</code> function. When the <code>$apply()</code> function call finishes AngularJS calls <code>$digest()</code> internally, so all data bindings are updated. </p>\n", "title": "Using $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply in AngularJS", "answer_id": 35550931, "question_id": 15112584, "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-scope"]}, {"body": "<p>Angular extends this <code>events-loop</code> creating something called <code>angular context</code>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>$watch()</strong></p>\n\n<p>Every time you bind something in the UI you insert a <code>$watch in a $watch list</code>. </p>\n\n<pre><code>User: &lt;input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"user\" /&gt;\nPassword: &lt;input type=\"password\" ng-model=\"pass\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here we have <code>$scope.user</code>, which is bound to the first input, and we have <code>$scope.pass</code>, which is bound to the second one.

Programming languages or frameworks which have been designed to handle web-requests usually do \"The Right Thing\u2122\" with such requests and provide you with easy access to the readily decoded values (like <code>$_REQUEST</code> or <code>$_POST</code> in PHP, or <code>cgi.FieldStorage()</code>, <code>flask.request.form</code> in Python).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now let's digress a bit, which may help understand the difference ;)</p>\n\n<p>The difference between <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests are largely semantic. They are also \"used\" differently, which explains the difference in how values are passed.</p>\n\n<h1>GET (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1\">relevant RFC section</a>)</h1>\n\n<p>When executing a <code>GET</code> request, you ask the server for one, or a set of entities. To allow the client to filter the result, it can use the so called \"query string\" of the URL. The query string is the part after the <code>?</code>. This is part of the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3\">URI syntax</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So, from the point of view of your application code (the part which <em>receives</em> the request), you will need to inspect the URI query part to gain access to these values.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the keys and values are part of the URI. Browsers <em>may</em> impose a limit on URI length. The HTTP standard states that there is no limit. But at the time of this writing, most browsers <em>do</em> limit the URIs (I don't have specific values). <code>GET</code> requests should <em>never</em> be used to submit new information to the server. Especially not larger documents. That's where you should use <code>POST</code> or <code>PUT</code>.</p>\n\n<h1>POST (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3\">relevant RFC section</a>)</h1>\n\n<p>When executing a <code>POST</code> request, the client is actually submitting a new <em>document</em> to the remote host. So, a <em>query</em> string does not (semantically) make sense. Which is why you don't have access to them in your application code.</p>\n\n<p><code>POST</code> is a little bit more complex (and <em>way</em> more flexible):</p>\n\n<p>When receiving a POST request, you should always expect a \"payload\", or, in HTTP terms: a <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3\">message body</a>. The message body in itself is pretty useless, as there is no <em>standard</em> (as far as I can tell. Maybe application/octet-stream?) format. The body format is defined by the <code>Content-Type</code> header. When using a HTML <code>FORM</code> element with <code>method=\"POST\"</code>, this is usually <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. Another very common type is <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2388\">multipart/form-data</a> if you use file uploads. But is could be <em>anything</em>, ranging from <code>text/plain</code>, over <code>application/json</code> or even a custom <code>application/octet-stream</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, if a <code>POST</code> request is made with a <code>Content-Type</code> which cannot be handled by the application, it should return a <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.13\"><code>415</code> status-code</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most programming languages (and/or web-frameworks) offer a way to de/encode the message body from/to the most common types (like <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>multipart/form-data</code> or <code>application/json</code>). So that's easy. Custom types require potentially a bit more work.</p>\n\n<p>Using a standard HTML form encoded document as example, the application should perform the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read the <code>Content-Type</code> field</li>\n<li>If the value is not one of the supported media-types, then return a response with a <code>415</code> status code</li>\n<li>otherwise, decode the values from the message body.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, languages like PHP, or web-frameworks for other popular languages will probably handle this for you. The exception to this is the <code>415</code> error. No framework can predict which content-types your application chooses to support and/or not support. This is up to you.</p>\n\n<h1>PUT (<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4\">relevant RFC section</a>)</h1>\n\n<p>A <code>PUT</code> request is pretty much handled in the exact same way as a <code>POST</code> request. The big difference is that a <code>POST</code> request is supposed to let the server decide how to (and if at all) create a new resource. Historically (from the now obsolete RFC2616 it was to create a new resource as a \"subordinate\" (child) of the URI where the request was sent to).</p>\n\n<p>A <code>PUT</code> request in contrast is supposed to \"deposit\" a resource exactly <em>at</em> that URI, and with <em>exactly</em> that content. No more, no less. The idea is that the <em>client</em> is responsible to craft the <em>complete</em> resource befor \"PUTting\" it. The server should accept it <em>as-is</em> on the given URL.</p>\n\n<p>As a consequence, a <code>POST</code> request is usually not used to <em>replace</em> an existing resource. A <code>PUT</code> request can do both create <em>and</em> replace.</p>\n\n<h1>Side-Note</h1>\n\n<p>There are also \"<a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3\">path parameters</a>\" which can be used to send additional data to the remote, but they are so uncommon, that I won't go into too much detail here. But, for reference, here is an excerpt from the RFC:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Aside from dot-segments in hierarchical paths, a path segment is considered\n  opaque by the generic syntax.  URI producing applications often use the\n  reserved characters allowed in a segment to delimit scheme-specific or\n  dereference-handler-specific subcomponents.  For example, the semicolon (\";\")\n  and equals (\"=\") reserved characters are often used to delimit parameters and\n  parameter values applicable to that segment.  The comma (\",\") reserved\n  character is often used for similar purposes.  For example, one URI producer\n  might use a segment such as \"name;v=1.1\" to indicate a reference to version\n  1.1 of \"name\", whereas another might use a segment such as \"name,1.1\" to\n  indicate the same.  Parameter types may be defined by scheme-specific\n  semantics, but in most cases the syntax of a parameter is specific to the\n  implementation of the URI's dereferencing algorithm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "How are parameters sent in an HTTP POST request?", "answer_id": 26717908, "question_id": 14551194, "tags": ["http", "post", "parameters", "request", "uri"]}, {"body": "<p>Some of the webservices require you to place request <em>data</em> and <em>metadata</em> separately.

So that's simple enough.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I have a webpage that lists snippets of digits for the purpose of verifying computations against them: <a href=\"http://www.numberworld.org/digits/Pi/\">http://www.numberworld.org/digits/Pi/</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>But when you get into world-record territory, there's nothing to compare against.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, the standard approach for verifying that computed digits are correct is to recompute the digits using a second algorithm. So if either computation goes bad, the digits at the end won't match.</p>\n\n<p>This does typically more than double the amount of time needed (since the second algorithm is usually slower). But it's the only way to verify the computed digits once you've wandered into the uncharted territory of never-before-computed digits and a new world record.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Back in the days where supercomputers were setting the records, two different <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM_method\">AGM algorithms</a> were commonly used:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm\">Gauss\u2013Legendre algorithm</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borwein%27s_algorithm\">Borwein's algorithm</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are both <code>O(N log(N)^2)</code> algorithms that were fairly easy to implement.</p>\n\n<p>However, nowadays, things are a bit different. In the last three world records, instead of performing two computations, we performed only one computation using the fastest known formula (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm\">Chudnovsky Formula</a>):</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/bjkw6tu.png\" alt=\"Enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>This algorithm is much harder to implement, but it is a lot faster than the AGM algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>Then we verify the binary digits using the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula\">BBP formulas for digit extraction</a>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/b56zl9d.png\" alt=\"Enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>This formula allows you to compute arbitrary binary digits <em>without</em> computing all the digits before it. So it is used to verify the last few computed binary digits. Therefore it is <strong><em>much</em></strong> faster than a full computation.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of this is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Only one expensive computation is needed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The disadvantage is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>An implementation of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula\">Bailey\u2013Borwein\u2013Plouffe</a> (BBP) formula is needed.</li>\n<li>An additional step is needed to verify the radix conversion from binary to decimal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><sub>I've glossed over some details of why verifying the last few digits implies that all the digits are correct. But it is easy to see this since any computation error will propagate to the last digits.</sub></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now this last step (verifying the conversion) is actually fairly important. One of the previous world record holders <strong><em>actually called us out</em></strong> on this because, initially, I didn't give a sufficient description of how it worked.</p>\n\n<p>So I've pulled this snippet from my blog:</p>\n\n<pre><code>N = # of decimal digits desired\np = 64-bit prime number\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/csv4fyo.png\" alt=\"Enter image description here\"><br></p>\n\n<p>Compute A using base 10 arithmetic and B using binary arithmetic.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://mathurl.com/cu4slf5.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>If <code>A = B</code>, then with \"extremely high probability\", the conversion is correct.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>For further reading, see my blog post <strong><a href=\"http://www.numberworld.org/misc_runs/pi-5t/details.html\">Pi - 5 Trillion Digits</a></strong>.</p>\n", "title": "How to determine whether my calculation of pi is accurate?", "answer_id": 14283481, "question_id": 14283270, "tags": ["algorithm", "math", "language-agnostic", "pi"]}, {"body": "<p>Undoubtedly, for your purposes (which I assume is just a programming exercise), the best thing is to check your results against any of the listings of the digits of pi on the web.</p>\n\n<p>And how do we know that those values are correct?

The <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952\"><code>.gz</code> gzip format</a> is for single files, also using the Deflate compression method.  Often gzip is used in combination with <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Standard.html\">tar to make a compressed archive format</a>, <code>.tar.gz</code>.

It is an archive format that stores files and their directory structure, where each file is individually compressed.  The file type is <code>.zip</code>.  The files, as well as the directory structure, can optionally be encrypted.</p>\n\n<p>The ZIP format supports several compression methods:</p>\n\n<pre><code>0 - The file is stored (no compression)\n1 - The file is Shrunk\n2 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 1\n3 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 2\n4 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 3\n5 - The file is Reduced with compression factor 4\n6 - The file is Imploded\n7 - Reserved for Tokenizing compression algorithm\n8 - The file is Deflated\n9 - Enhanced Deflating using Deflate64(tm)\n10 - PKWARE Data Compression Library Imploding (old IBM TERSE)\n11 - Reserved by PKWARE\n12 - File is compressed using BZIP2 algorithm\n13 - Reserved by PKWARE\n14 - LZMA (EFS)\n15 - Reserved by PKWARE\n16 - Reserved by PKWARE\n17 - Reserved by PKWARE\n18 - File is compressed using IBM TERSE (new)\n19 - IBM LZ77 z Architecture (PFS)\n97 - WavPack compressed data\n98 - PPMd version I, Rev 1\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Methods 1 to 7 are historical and are not in use.  Methods 9 through 98 are relatively recent additions, and are in varying, small amounts of use.  The only method in truly widespread use in the ZIP format is method 8, <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951\">Deflate</a>, and to some smaller extent method 0, which is no compression at all.  Virtually every <code>.zip</code> file that you will come across in the wild will use exclusively methods 8 and 0, likely just method 8.  (Method 8 also has a means to effectively store the data with no compression and relatively little expansion, and Method 0 cannot be streamed whereas Method 8 can be.)</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000361.shtml\">ISO/IEC 21320-1:2015 standard for file containers</a> is a restricted zip format, such as used in Java archive files (.jar), Office Open XML files (Microsoft Office .docx, .xlsx, .pptx), Office Document Format files (.odt, .ods, .odp), and EPUB files (.epub). That standard limits the compression methods to 0 and 8, as well as other constraints such as no encryption or signatures.</p>\n\n<p>Around 1990, the <a href=\"http://www.info-zip.org/\">Info-ZIP group</a> wrote portable, free, open source implementations of <code>zip</code> and <code>unzip</code> utilities, supporting compression with the Deflate format, and decompression of that and the earlier formats.  This greatly expanded the use of the <code>.zip</code> format.</p>\n\n<p>In the early 90's, the <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952\">gzip format</a> was developed as a replacement for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compress\">Unix <code>compress</code> utility</a>, derived from the Deflate code in the Info-ZIP utilities.  Unix <code>compress</code> was designed to compress a single file or stream, appending a <code>.Z</code> to the file name.  <code>compress</code> uses the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch\">LZW compression algorithm</a>, which at the time was under patent and its free use was in dispute by the patent holders.  Though some specific implementations of Deflate were patented by Phil Katz, the format was not, and so it was possible to write a Deflate implementation that did not infringe on any patents.  That implementation has not been so challenged in the last 20+ years.  The Unix <code>gzip</code> utility was intended as a drop-in replacement for <code>compress</code>, and in fact is able to decompress <code>compress</code>-compressed data (assuming that you were able to parse that sentence).  <code>gzip</code> appends a <code>.gz</code> to the file name.  <code>gzip</code> uses the Deflate compressed data format, which compresses quite a bit better than Unix <code>compress</code>, has very fast decompression, and adds a CRC-32 as an integrity check for the data.  The header format also permits the storage of more information than the <code>compress</code> format allowed, such as the original file name and the file modification time.</p>\n\n<p>Though <code>compress</code> only compresses a single file, it was common to use the <code>tar</code> utility to create an archive of files, their attributes, and their directory structure into a single <code>.tar</code> file, and to then compress it with <code>compress</code> to make a <code>.tar.Z</code> file.  In fact the <code>tar</code> utility had and still has an option to do the compression at the same time, instead of having to pipe the output of <code>tar</code> to <code>compress</code>.  This all carried forward to the gzip format, and <code>tar</code> has an option to compress directly to the <code>.tar.gz</code> format.  The <code>tar.gz</code> format compresses better than the <code>.zip</code> approach, since the compression of a <code>.tar</code> can take advantage of redundancy across files, especially many small files.  <code>.tar.gz</code> is the most common archive format in use on Unix due to its very high portability, but there are more effective compression methods in use as well, so you will often see <code>.tar.bz2</code> and <code>.tar.xz</code> archives.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike <code>.tar</code>, <code>.zip</code> has a central directory at the end, which provides a list of the contents. That and the separate compression provides random access to the individual entries in a <code>.zip</code> file. A <code>.tar</code> file would have to be decompressed and scanned from start to end in order to build a directory, which is how a <code>.tar</code> file is listed.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after the introduction of gzip, around the mid-1990's, the same patent dispute called into question the free use of the <code>.gif</code> image format, very widely used on bulletin boards and the World Wide Web (a new thing at the time).  So a small group created the PNG losslessly compressed image format, with file type <code>.png</code>, to replace <code>.gif</code>.  That format also uses the Deflate format for compression, which is applied after filters on the image data expose more of the redundancy.  In order to promote widespread usage of the PNG format, two free code libraries were created.  <a href=\"http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html\">libpng</a> and <a href=\"http://zlib.net/\">zlib</a>.  libpng handled all of the features of the PNG format, and zlib provided the compression and decompression code for use by libpng, as well as for other applications.  zlib was adapted from the <code>gzip</code> code.</p>\n\n<p>All of the mentioned patents have since expired.</p>\n\n<p>The zlib library supports Deflate compression and decompression, and three kinds of wrapping around the deflate streams.  Those are: no wrapping at all (\"raw\" deflate), <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950\">zlib wrapping</a>, which is used in the PNG format data blocks, and gzip wrapping, to provide gzip routines for the programmer.  The main difference between zlib and gzip wrapping is that the zlib wrapping is more compact, six bytes vs. a minimum of 18 bytes for gzip, and the integrity check, Adler-32, runs faster than the CRC-32 that gzip uses.  Raw deflate is used by programs that read and write the <code>.zip</code> format, which is another format that wraps around deflate compressed data.</p>\n\n<p>zlib is now in wide use for data transmission and storage.  For example, most HTTP transactions by servers and browsers compress and decompress the data using zlib.</p>\n\n<p>Different implementations of deflate can result in different compressed output for the same input data, as evidenced by the existence of selectable compression levels that allow trading off compression effectiveness for CPU time. zlib and PKZIP are not the only implementations of deflate compression and decompression. Both the <a href=\"http://www.7-zip.org/\">7-Zip archiving utility</a> and Google's <a href=\"http://github.com/google/zopfli\">zopfli library</a> have the ability to use much more CPU time than zlib in order to squeeze out the last few bits possible when using the deflate format, reducing compressed sizes by a few percent as compared to zlib's highest compression level. The <a href=\"http://zlib.net/pigz/\">pigz utility</a>, a parallel implementation of gzip, includes the option to use zlib (compression levels 1-9) or zopfli (compression level 11), and somewhat mitigates the time impact of using zopfli by splitting the compression of large files over multiple processors and cores.</p>\n", "title": "How are zlib, gzip and zip related?

If you want to add a library via Android Studio creator just check <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/16634680/2021293\">the answer</a> below with visual guide (there are some differences between Android Studio 1.0 and those from screenshots, but the process is very similar).</p>\n\n<p>Before you start adding a library to your project by hand, consider adding the external dependency. It won\u2019t mess in your project structure. Almost every well-known Android library is available in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\">Maven</a> repository and its installation takes only one line of code in the <code>app/build.gradle</code> file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dependencies {\n     compile 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:6.0.0'\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Adding the library</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here is the full process of adding external Android library to our project:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a new project via Android Studio creator. I named it <em>HelloWorld</em>.</li>\n<li>Here is the original project structure created by Android Studio:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>HelloWorld/\n      app/\n           - build.gradle  // local Gradle configuration (for app only)\n           ...\n      - build.gradle // Global Gradle configuration (for whole project)\n      - settings.gradle\n      - gradle.properties\n      ...\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>In the root directory (<code>HelloWorld/</code>), create new folder: <code>/libs</code> in which we\u2019ll place our external libraries (this step is not required - only for keeping a cleaner project structure).</li>\n<li>Paste your library in the newly created <code>/libs</code> folder. In this example I used <a href=\"https://github.com/astuetz/PagerSlidingTabStrip\">PagerSlidingTabStrip library</a> (just download ZIP from GitHub, rename library directory to \u201ePagerSlidingTabStrip\" and copy it). Here is the new structure of our project:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>HelloWorld/\n      app/\n           - build.gradle  // Local Gradle configuration (for app only)\n           ...\n      libs/\n           PagerSlidingTabStrip/\n                - build.gradle // Local Gradle configuration (for library only)\n      - build.gradle // Global Gradle configuration (for whole project)\n      - settings.gradle\n      - gradle.properties\n      ...\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><p>Edit settings.gradle by adding your library to <code>include</code>. If you use a custom path like I did, you have also to define the project directory for our library. A whole settings.gradle should look like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>include ':app', ':PagerSlidingTabStrip'\nproject(':PagerSlidingTabStrip').projectDir = new File('libs/PagerSlidingTabStrip')\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>5.1 If you face \"Default Configuration\" error, then try this instead of step 5,</p>\n\n<pre><code>    include ':app'\n    include ':libs:PagerSlidingTabStrip'\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><p>In <code>app/build.gradle</code> add our library project as an dependency:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dependencies {\n    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n    compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'\n    compile project(\":PagerSlidingTabStrip\")\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>6.1. If you followed step 5.1, then follow this instead of 6,</p>\n\n<pre><code>    dependencies {\n        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])\n        compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:21.0.3'\n\n        compile project(\":libs:PagerSlidingTabStrip\")\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><p>If your library project doesn\u2019t have <code>build.gradle</code> file you have to create it manually. Here is example of that file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    apply plugin: 'com.android.library'\n\n    dependencies {\n        compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:21.0.3'\n    }\n\n    android {\n        compileSdkVersion 21\n        buildToolsVersion \"21.1.2\"\n\n        defaultConfig {\n            minSdkVersion 14\n            targetSdkVersion 21\n        }\n\n        sourceSets {\n            main {\n                manifest.srcFile 'AndroidManifest.xml'\n                java.srcDirs = ['src']\n                res.srcDirs = ['res']\n            }\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Additionally you can create a global configuration for your project which will contain SDK versions and build tools version for every module to keep consistency. Just edit <code>gradle.properties</code> file and add lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ANDROID_BUILD_MIN_SDK_VERSION=14\nANDROID_BUILD_TARGET_SDK_VERSION=21\nANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION=21.1.3\nANDROID_BUILD_SDK_VERSION=21\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can use it in your <code>build.gradle</code> files (in app and libraries modules) like below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>//...\nandroid {\n    compileSdkVersion Integer.parseInt(project.ANDROID_BUILD_SDK_VERSION)\n    buildToolsVersion project.ANDROID_BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION\n\n    defaultConfig {\n        minSdkVersion Integer.parseInt(project.ANDROID_BUILD_MIN_SDK_VERSION)\n        targetSdkVersion Integer.parseInt(project.ANDROID_BUILD_TARGET_SDK_VERSION)\n    }\n}\n//...\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>That\u2019s all. Just click\u201a synchronise the project with the Gradle\u2019 icon <img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/QH01w.png\" alt=\"synchronise with Gradle\">.

The server can either query the db for the original values or the client should send the original values to the server along with the changed rows. The server should attach the original values and use the UpdateStatus column for each row to decide how to handle the new values. In this scenario I always use optimistic concurrency.

Even if the data container is deleted, the data itself will not be lost as long as any container has a reference to that volume i.e. any container that mounted the volume via <code>--volumes-from</code>. So unless all the related containers are stopped and deleted (one could consider this the equivalent of an accidental <code>rm -fr /</code>) the data is safe. You can always recreate the data container by doing <code>--volumes-from</code> any container that has a reference to that volume.</p>\n\n<p>As always, make backups though!</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: I think the docker guys are working on a new mechanism to manage volumes independently of containers, which should further make this easier to manage.

The build system automatically takes all the source files (<code>.java</code> or <code>.xml</code>), then applies the appropriate tool (e.g. takes <code>java</code> class files and converts them to <code>dex</code> files), and groups all of them into one compressed file, our beloved APK.</p>\n\n<p>This build system uses some conventions: an example of one is to specify the directory containing the source files (in Eclipse it is <code>\\src</code> folder) or resources files (in Eclipse it is <code>\\res</code> folder).</p>\n\n<p>Now, in order to automate all these tasks, there has to be a script; you can write your own build system using shell scripting in linux or batch files syntax in windows. Got it?</p>\n\n<p>Gradle is another <strong>build system</strong> that takes the best features from other build systems and combines them into one. It is improved based off of their shortcomings.\nIt is a <strong>JVM based build system</strong>, what that means is that you can write your own script in Java, which Android Studio makes use of.</p>\n\n<p>One cool thing about gradle is that it is a <strong>plugin based system</strong>. This means if you have your own programming language and you want to automate the task of building some package (output like a JAR for Java) from sources then you can write a complete plugin in Java or Groovy, and distribute it to rest of world.</p>\n\n<h3>Why did Google use it?</h3>\n\n<p>Google saw one of the most advanced build systems on the market and realized that you could write scripts of your own with little to no learning curve, and without learning Groovy or any other new language. So they wrote the Android plugin for Gradle.</p>\n\n<p>You must have seen <code>build.gradle</code> file(s) in your project. That is where you can write scripts to automate your tasks.

The Android Studio gives no useful help or tips as to how to solve the problem. It doesn't tell you where you can manually look in the Eclipse folders.

And people trying to use those projects in AS are hitting the same issues.</p>\n\n<p>And anyway, if Gradle is this super-powerful build system, why am I still managing a whole lot of other dependencies in the sdk manager? Why can't a project that needs, say, the ndk specify this in its Gradle file so that it gets automatically installed and built-against when needed? Why is NDK special? Similarly for target platforms?

It won't work unless you reset the boolean to false, then $digest, then reset it back to true. Even if you use a string comparison in your expression, you'll be forced to change the string to something else, $digest, then change it back.</strike> (This has been addressed with the blur event handler.)</p>\n\n<p>So I propose this alternate solution:</p>\n\n<h3>Use an event, the forgotten feature of Angular.</h3>\n\n<p>JavaScript loves events after all. Events are inherently loosely coupled, and even better, you avoid adding another $watch to your $digest.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>app.directive('focusOn', function() {\n   return function(scope, elem, attr) {\n      scope.$on(attr.focusOn, function(e) {\n          elem[0].focus();\n      });\n   };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So now you could use it like this:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;input type=\"text\" focus-on=\"newItemAdded\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and then anywhere in your app... </p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>$scope.addNewItem = function () {\n    /* stuff here to add a new item... */\n\n    $scope.$broadcast('newItemAdded');\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is awesome because you can do all sorts of things with something like this. For one, you could tie into events that already exist. For another thing you start doing something smart by having different parts of your app publish events that other parts of your app can subscribe to.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow, this type of thing screams \"event driven\" to me. I think as Angular developers we try really hard to hammer $scope shaped pegs into event shape holes.</p>\n\n<p>Is it the best solution? I dunno. It's <em>a</em> solution.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Updated Solution</h2>\n\n<p>After @ShimonRachlenko's comment below, I've changed my method of doing this slightly.

One major difference from CommonJS is that AMD specifies that modules are loaded <em>asynchronously</em> - that means modules are loaded in parallel, as opposed to blocking the execution by waiting for a load to finish.</p>\n\n<p>AMD is generally more used in client-side (in-browser) JavaScript development due to this, and CommonJS Modules are generally used server-side. However, you can use either module spec in either environment - for example, RequireJS offers <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">directions for running in Node.js</a> and <a href=\"http://browserify.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">browserify</a> is a CommonJS Module implementation that can run in the browser.</p>\n", "title": "Relation between CommonJS, AMD and RequireJS?", "answer_id": 16522834, "question_id": 16521471, "tags": ["javascript", "module", "requirejs", "amd", "commonjs"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>RequireJS</strong> implements the <strong>AMD</strong> API <a href=\"http://www.requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html\">(source)</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CommonJS</strong> is a way of defining modules with the help of an <code>exports</code> object, that defines the module contents. Simply put, a CommonJS implementation might work like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// someModule.js\nexports.doSomething = function() { return \"foo\"; };\n\n//otherModule.js\nvar someModule = require('someModule'); // in the vein of node    \nexports.doSomethingElse = function() { return someModule.doSomething() + \"bar\"; };\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Basically, CommonJS specifies that you need to have a <code>require()</code> function to fetch dependencies, an <code>exports</code> variable to export module contents and a module identifier (which describes the location of the module in question in relation to this module) that is used to require the dependencies(<a href=\"http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1\">source</a>). CommonJS has various implementations, including <strong>Node.js</strong>, which you mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>CommonJS was not particularly designed with browsers in mind, so it doesn't fit in the browser environment very well (<em>I really have no source for this--it just says so everywhere, including <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html\">the RequireJS site.</em></a>). Apparently, this has something to do with asynchronous loading, etc. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, RequireJS implements AMD, which is designed to suit the browser environment(<a href=\"https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD\">source</a>). Apparently, AMD started as an spinoff of the CommonJS Transport format and evolved into its own module definition API. Hence the similarities between the two. The new feature in AMD is the <code>define()</code> -function that allows the module to declare its dependencies before being loaded. For example, the definition could be:</p>\n\n<pre><code>define('module/id/string', ['module', 'dependency', 'array'], \nfunction(module, factory function) {\n  return ModuleContents;  \n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So, CommonJS and AMD are <strong>JavaScript</strong> module definition APIs that have different implementations, but both come from the same origins.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>AMD</strong> is more suited for the browser, because it supports asynchronous loading of module dependencies.</li>\n<li><strong>RequireJS</strong> is an implementation of <strong>AMD</strong>, while at the same time trying to keep the spirit of <strong>CommonJS</strong> (mainly in the module identifiers).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To confuse you even more, RequireJS, while being an AMD implementation, offers a CommonJS wrapper so CommonJS modules can almost directly be imported into use with RequireJS.</p>\n\n<pre><code>define(function(require, exports, module) {\n  var someModule = require('someModule'); // in the vein of node    \n  exports.doSomethingElse = function() { return someModule.doSomething() + \"bar\"; };\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Hope this helped to clarify things!</p>\n", "title": "Relation between CommonJS, AMD and RequireJS?", "answer_id": 16522990, "question_id": 16521471, "tags": ["javascript", "module", "requirejs", "amd", "commonjs"]}, {"body": "<h1>The short answer would be:</h1>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules\">CommonJS</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/amdjs\">AMD</a></strong> are specifications (or formats) on how modules and their dependencies should be declared in javascript applications.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a></strong> is a script loader library that is AMD compliant, <a href=\"http://davidwalsh.name/curljs\">curljs</a> being another example.</p>\n\n<h2>CommonJS compliant:</h2>\n\n<p>Taken from <a href=\"http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailcommonjs\">Addy Osmani's book</a>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>// package/lib is a dependency we require\nvar lib = require( \"package/lib\" );\n\n// behavior for our module\nfunction foo(){\n    lib.log( \"hello world!\" );\n}\n\n// export (expose) foo to other modules as foobar\nexports.foobar = foo;\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>AMD compliant:</h2>\n\n<pre><code>// package/lib is a dependency we require\ndefine([\"package/lib\"], function (lib) {\n\n    // behavior for our module\n    function foo() {\n        lib.log( \"hello world!\" );\n    }\n\n    // export (expose) foo to other modules as foobar\n    return {\n        foobar: foo\n    }\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Somewhere else the module can be used with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>require([\"package/myModule\"], function(myModule) {\n    myModule.foobar();\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<h1>Some background:</h1>\n\n<p>Actually, <a href=\"http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS\">CommonJS</a> is much more than an API declaration and only a part of it deals with that.

When the browser sees that definition, it's registered as a new element.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>On to questions!</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the difference between Angular and Polymer?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We covered some of this in our <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irGDN5Ysi_A&amp;t=21m45s\">Q&amp;A video</a>. In general, Polymer is a library that aims to use (and show how to use) Web Components. Its foundation is Custom Elements (e.g. everything you build is a web component) and it evolves as the web evolves. To that end, we only support the latest version of the modern browsers.</p>\n\n<p>I'll use this image to describe Polymer's entire architecture stack:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ksn6s.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>RED layer: We get tomorrow's web through a set of polyfills. Keep in mind, those libraries go away over time as browsers adopt the new APIs.</p>\n\n<p>YELLOW layer: Sprinkle in some sugar with polymer.js. This layer is our opinion on how to use the spec'd APIs, together. It also adds things like data-binding, syntatic sugar, change watchers, published properties...We think these things are helpful for building web component-based apps.</p>\n\n<p>GREEN: The comprehensive set of UI components (green layer) is still in progress. These will be web components that use all of the red + yellow layers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Angular directives vs. Custom Elements?</strong></p>\n\n<p>See Alex Russell's <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!searchin/polymer-dev/angular/polymer-dev/s761szb9WJc/Lb29XuoJdqAJ\">answer</a>. Basically, Shadow DOM allows composing bits of HTML but also is a tool for encapsulating that HTML. This is fundamentally a new concept on the web and something other frameworks will leverage.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What problems does Polymer solve that AngularJS has not or will not?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Similarities: declarative templates, data binding. </p>\n\n<p>Differences: Angular has high level APIs for services, filters, animations, etc., supports IE8, and at this point, is a much more robust framework for building production apps. Polymer is just starting out in alpha.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are there plans to tie Polymer in with AngularJS in the future?</strong></p>\n\n<p>They're <a href=\"http://www.polymer-project.org/resources/faq.html#frameworks\">separate projects</a>. That said, both the Angular and Ember teams <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/polymer-dev/4RSYaKmbtEk/uYnY3900wpIJ\">announced</a> they'll eventually move to using the underlying platform APIs in their own frameworks.</p>\n\n<p>^ This is a huge win IMO. In a world where web developers have powerful tools (Shadow DOM, Custom Elements), framework authors also can utilize these primitives to create better frameworks. Most of them currently go through great hoops to \"get the job done\".</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:</p>\n\n<p>There's a really great article on this topic: \"<a href=\"http://www.binpress.com/blog/2014/06/26/polymer-vs-angular/\">Here\u2019s the difference between Polymer and Angular</a>\"</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between Polymer elements and AngularJS directives?", "answer_id": 18092637, "question_id": 18089075, "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "polymer"]}, {"body": "<p>For your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are there plans to tie Polymer in with AngularJS in the future?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the official twitter account of AngularJS : \"angularjs will use polymer for its widgets.

The major differences as I can see it are that polymer leverages web APIs to include bits of HTML, a more syntactically correct, and simplistic way of achieving what Angular does programatically as it renders templates.  Polymer is however as has been stated, a small framework for building declarative and interactive templates using components.  It is made available for UI design purposes only, and is only supported in the most modern browsers.  AngularJS is a complete MVC framework designed to make web applications declarative by use of data bindings, dependencies, and directives.  They're two completely different animals.  To your question, it seems to me at this point you'll get no major benefit from using polymer over angular, except having dozens of pre built components, however that would still require you to port those over to angular directives.  In the future however, as the web APIs become more advanced, web components will completely remove the need to programatically define and build templates as the browser will be able to simply include them in a similar way to how it handles javascript or css files.</p>\n", "title": "What is the difference between Polymer elements and AngularJS directives?", "answer_id": 24616581, "question_id": 18089075, "tags": ["javascript", "angularjs", "polymer"]}, {"body": "<p><strong>1 &amp; 2)</strong> Polymer components are scoped because of their hidden tree in the shadow dom. That means that their style and behaviour cannot bleed out. Angular is not scoped to that particular directive you create like a polymer web component. An angular directive could possibly conflict with something in your global scope. IMO the benefit you will get from polymer is what I explained.. modular components that have scoped css &amp; JavaScript to that particular component that nothing can touch. Untouchable DOM!</p>\n\n<p>Angular directives can be created so that you can annotate an element with several pieces of functionality. In Polymer web components that is not the case. If you want to combine functionality of components you include two components into another component (or wrap them in another component) or you can extend an existing component. Remember the main difference still is that each component is scoped in polymer web components. You can share css &amp; js files across several components or you can inline them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Yes, Angular plans on incorporating polymer in version 2+ according to Rob Dodson and Eric Bidelman</p>\n\n<p>It's funny how nobody here has mentioned the word scope. I think that is one of the major differences. </p>\n\n<p>There are many differences, but they also have a heck of a lot in common when it comes to creating modular lego like pieces of functionality for an app. I think it's safe to say that Angular would be the application framework and polymer could one day live in the same app along side directives with the major difference being scope but polymer may be a replacement for a lot of your current directives.

It's a jquery solution vs. css, but wanted to recommend it as an alternative approach.</p>\n", "title": "How can I make Bootstrap columns all the same height?", "answer_id": 20078428, "question_id": 19695784, "tags": ["css", "twitter-bootstrap"]}, {"body": "<p>Thought I'd just add that the answer given by Dr.Flink can also be applied to a Bootstrap 3 <code>form-horizontal</code> block - which can be very handy if you want to use background colours for each cell.

The flexbox-based answers are the right way once IE8 and 9 are dead, and once Android 2.x is dead, but that is not true in 2015, and likely won't be in 2016. IE8 and 9 still make up 4-6% of usage depending on how you measure, and for many corporate users it's much worse. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox</a></p>\n\n<p>The <code>display: table</code>, <code>display: table-cell</code> trick is more backwards-compatible - and one great thing is the only serious compatibility issue is a Safari issue where it forces <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>, something already applied to your Bootstrap tags. <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-table\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-table</a></p>\n\n<p>You can obviously add more classes that do similar things, like <code>.equal-height-md</code>. I tied these to divs for the small performance benefit in my constrained usage, but you could remove the tag to make it more generalized like the rest of Bootstrap.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the jsfiddle here uses CSS, and so, things Less would otherwise provide are hard-coded in the linked example.

The table demo is a decent idea, but is being implemented wrong. Applying that css on bootstrap column classes specifically will without a doubt break the grid framework entirely. You should be using a custom selector for one and two the tables styles should not be applied to <code>[class*='col-']</code> that have defined widths. This method should ONLY be used if you wan't equal height AND equal width columns. It is not meant for any other layouts and is NOT responsive. We can make it fallback however on mobile displays...</p>\n\n<pre><code>// HTML\n&lt;div class=\"table-row-equal\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"thumbnail\"&gt;\n    Content...\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"thumbnail\"&gt;\n    Content...\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n//CSS\n@media only screen and (min-width : 480px){\n    .table-row-equal {\n        display: table;\n        width: 100%;\n        table-layout: fixed;\n        border-spacing: 30px 0px;\n        word-wrap: break-word;\n        border-spacing: 30px 0px;\n    }\n    .table-row-equal .thumbnail {\n        float: none;\n        display: table-cell;\n        vertical-align: top;\n        width: 1%;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Lastly, the first demo in the accepted answer which implements a version of the <a href=\"http://www.positioniseverything.net/articles/onetruelayout/example/equalheightopera8fix\">one true layout</a> is a good choice for some situations, but not suitable for bootstrap columns. The reason for this is that all the columns expand to the the container height. So this will also break responsiveness since the columns are not expanding to the elements next to them, but the entire container. This method will also not allow you to apply bottom margins to rows any longer and will also cause other issues along the way like scrolling to anchor tags.</p>\n\n<p>For the complete code see the codepen which automatically prefixes the flexbox code.</p>\n", "title": "How can I make Bootstrap columns all the same height?", "answer_id": 34381153, "question_id": 19695784, "tags": ["css", "twitter-bootstrap"]}, {"body": "<p>Here is my method, i have used flex with some changes in media query.</p>\n\n<pre><code>  @media (min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 767px) {\n  .fsi-row-xs-level {\n    display: -webkit-box;\n    display: -webkit-flex;\n    display: -ms-flexbox;\n    display: flex;\n  }\n}\n@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {\n  .fsi-row-sm-level {\n    display: -webkit-box;\n    display: -webkit-flex;\n    display: -ms-flexbox;\n    display: flex;\n  }\n}\n@media (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199px) {\n  .fsi-row-md-level {\n    display: -webkit-box;\n    display: -webkit-flex;\n    display: -ms-flexbox;\n    display: flex;\n  }\n}\n@media (min-width: 1200px) {\n  .fsi-row-lg-level {\n    display: -webkit-box;\n    display: -webkit-flex;\n    display: -ms-flexbox;\n    display: flex;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>then added the classes to the parent which were required.</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"row fsi-row-lg-level fsi-row-md-level\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"col-sm-4\"&gt;column 1&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"col-sm-4\"&gt;column 2&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"col-sm-4\"&gt;column 3&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am using responsive breakpoints because flux usually hampers the bootstrap standard responsive nature.</p>\n", "title": "How can I make Bootstrap columns all the same height?", "answer_id": 35407943, "question_id": 19695784, "tags": ["css", "twitter-bootstrap"]}, {"body": "<p>I know I'm very late but now you can use the \"min-height\" style attribute to achieve your purpose.</p>\n", "title": "How can I make Bootstrap columns all the same height?", "answer_id": 35618625, "question_id": 19695784, "tags": ["css", "twitter-bootstrap"]}, {"body": "<p>Use this code.

First, lets start with primitive types and <code>void</code>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If the class object represents a primitive type or <code>void</code>, all the four methods simply returns its name.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now the rules for the <code>getName()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Every non-lambda and non-array class or interface (i.e, top-level, nested, inner, local and anonymous) has a name (which is returned by <code>getName()</code>) that is the package name followed by a dot (if there is a package), followed by the name of its class-file as generated by the compiler (whithout the suffix <code>.class</code>). If there is no package, it is simply the name of the class-file. If the class is an inner, nested, local or anonymous class, the compiler should generate at least one <code>$</code> in its class-file name. Note that for anonymous classes, the class name would end with a dollar-sign followed by a number.</li>\n<li>Lambda class names are generally unpredictable, and you shouldn't care about they anyway. Exactly, their name is the name of the enclosing class, followed by <code>$$Lambda$</code>, followed by a number, followed by a slash, followed by another number.</li>\n<li>The class descriptor of the primitives are <code>Z</code> for <code>boolean</code>, <code>B</code> for <code>byte</code>, <code>S</code> for <code>short</code>, <code>C</code> for <code>char</code>, <code>I</code> for <code>int</code>, <code>J</code> for <code>long</code>, <code>F</code> for <code>float</code> and <code>D</code> for <code>double</code>. For non-array classes and interfaces the class descriptor is <code>L</code> followed by what is given by <code>getName()</code> followed by <code>;</code>. For array classes, the class descriptor is <code>[</code> followed by the class descriptor of the component type (which may be itself another array class).</li>\n<li>For array classes, the <code>getName()</code> method returns its class descriptor. This rule seems to fail only for array classes whose the component type is a lambda (which possibly is a bug), but hopefully this should not matter anyway because there is no point even on the existence of array classes whose component type is a lambda.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, the <code>toString()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>If the class instance represents an interface (or an annotation, which is a special type of interface), the <code>toString()</code> returns <code>\"interface \" + getName()</code>. If it is a primitive, it returns simply <code>getName()</code>. If it is something else (a class type, even if it is a pretty weird one), it returns <code>\"class \" + getName()</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>For top-level classes and interfaces, the <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns just what the <code>getName()</code> method returns.</li>\n<li>The <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns <code>null</code> for anonymous or local classes and for array classes of those.</li>\n<li>For inner and nested classes and interfaces, the <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns what the <code>getName()</code> method would replacing the compiler-introduced dollar-signs by dots.</li>\n<li>For array classes, the <code>getCanonicalName()</code> method returns <code>null</code> if the canonical name of the component type is <code>null</code>. Otherwise, it returns the canonical name of the component type followed by <code>[]</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The <code>getSimpleName()</code> method:</p>\n\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>For top-level, nested, inner and local classes, the <code>getSimpleName()</code> returns the name of the class as written in the source file.</li>\n<li>For anonymous classes the <code>getSimpleName()</code> returns an empty <code>String</code>.</li>\n<li>For lambda classes the <code>getSimpleName()</code> just returns what the <code>getName()</code> would return without the package name. This do not makes much sense and looks like a bug for me, but there is no point in calling <code>getSimpleName()</code> on a lambda class to start with.</li>\n<li>For array classes the <code>getSimpleName()</code> method returns the simple name of the component class followed by <code>[]</code>. This have the funny/weird side-effect that array classes whose component type is an anonymous class have just <code>[]</code> as their simple names.</li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "What is the difference between canonical name, simple name and class name in Java Class?", "answer_id": 29527145, "question_id": 15202997, "tags": ["java"]}, {"body": "<p>I've been confused by the wide range of different naming schemes as well, and was just about to ask and answer my own question on this when I found this question here.

However, registers are very expensive and most computer cores have less than a few dozen registers (few hundred to maybe a thousand <em>bytes</em> total).  At the other end of the memory spectrum (<strong>DRAM</strong>), the memory is very cheap (i.e. literally <em>millions of times cheaper</em>) but takes hundreds of cycles after a request to receive the data.  To bridge this gap between super fast and expensive and super slow and cheap are the <strong>cache memories</strong>, named L1, L2, L3 in decreasing speed and cost. The idea is that most of the executing code will be hitting a small set of variables often, and the rest (a much larger set of variables) infrequently. If the processor can't find the data in L1 cache, then it looks in L2 cache. If not there, then L3 cache, and if not there, main memory. Each of these \"misses\" is expensive in time.</p>\n\n<p>(The analogy is cache memory is to system memory, as system memory is to hard disk storage. Hard disk storage is super cheap, but very slow).</p>\n\n<p>Caching is one of the main methods to reduce the impact of <em>latency</em> (cfr. the Herb Sutter talk I linked at the start). To paraphrase Herb Sutter (cfr. links below): <strong>increasing bandwidth is easy, but we can't buy our way out of latency</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Data is always retrieved through the memory hierarchy (smallest == fastest to slowest). A <em>cache hit/miss</em> usually refers to a hit/miss in the highest level of cache in the CPU -- by highest level I mean the largest == slowest. The cache hit rate is crucial for performance, since every cache miss results in fetching data from RAM (or worse ...) which takes <strong><em>a lot</em></strong> of time (hundreds of cycles for RAM, tens of millions of cycles for HDD). In comparison, reading data from the (highest level) cache typically takes only a handful of cycles.</p>\n\n<p>In modern computer architectures, the performance bottleneck is leaving the CPU die (e.g. accessing RAM or higher). This will only get worse over time. The increase in processor frequency is currently no longer relevant to increase performance. <strong>The problem is memory access.</strong> Hardware design efforts in CPUs therefore currently focus heavily on optimizing caches, prefetching, pipelines and concurrency. For instance, modern CPUs spend around 85% of die on caches and up to 99% for storing/moving data!</p>\n\n<p>There is quite a lot to be said on the subject. Here are a few great references about caches, memory hierarchies and proper programming:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.agner.org/optimize/\">Agner Fog's page</a>. In his excellent documents, you can find detailed examples covering languages ranging from assembly to C++. </li>\n<li>If you are into videos, I strongly recommend to have a look at  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7zSU9HI-6I\">Herb Sutter's talk on machine architecture (youtube)</a> (specifically check 12:00 and onwards!).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.research.scea.com/research/pdfs/GDC2003_Memory_Optimization_18Mar03.pdf\">Slides about memory optimization by Christer Ericson</a> (director of technology @ Sony)</li>\n<li>LWN.net's article <a href=\"http://lwn.net/Articles/250967/\">\"<em>What every programmer should know about memory</em>\"</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Main concepts for cache-friendly code</h2>\n\n<p>A very important aspect of cache-friendly code is all about <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference\">the principle of locality</a></strong>, the goal of which is to place related data close in memory to allow efficient caching. In terms of the CPU cache, it's important to be aware of cache lines to understand how this works: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3928995/how-do-cache-lines-work\">How do cache lines work?</a> </p>\n\n<p>The following particular aspects are of high importance to optimize caching:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Temporal locality</strong>: when a given memory location was accessed, it is likely that the same location is accessed again in the near future. Ideally, this information will still be cached at that point.</li>\n<li><strong>Spatial locality</strong>: this refers to placing related data close to eachother. Caching happens on many levels, not just in the CPU. For example, when you read from RAM, typically a larger chunk of memory is fetched than what was specifically asked for because very often the program will require that data soon. HDD caches follow the same line of thought. Specifically for CPU caches, the notion of <em>cache lines</em> is important.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Use appropriate <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a> containers</strong></p>\n\n<p>A simple example of cache-friendly versus cache-unfriendly is <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>'s <code>std::vector</code> versus <code>std::list</code>. Elements of a <code>std::vector</code> are stored in contiguous memory, and as such accessing them is <em>much</em> more cache-friendly than accessing elements in a <code>std::list</code>, which stores its content all over the place. This is due to spatial locality.</p>\n\n<p>A very nice illustration of this is given by Bjarne Stroustrup in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo\">this youtube clip</a> (thanks to @Mohammad Ali Baydoun for the link!).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Don't neglect the cache in data structure and algorithm design</strong></p>\n\n<p>Whenever possible, try to adapt your data structures and order of computations in a way that allows maximum use of the cache. An common technique in this regard is <a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/cs267/mg/report/node35.html\">cache blocking</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140113145619/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/cs267/mg/report/node35.html\">(Archive.org version)</a>, which is of extreme importance in high-performance computing (cfr. for example <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software\">ATLAS</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Know and exploit the implicit structure of data</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another simple example, which many people in the field sometimes forget is column-major (ex. <a href=\"/questions/tagged/fortran\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;fortran&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">fortran</a>,<a href=\"/questions/tagged/matlab\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;matlab&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">matlab</a>) vs. row-major ordering (ex. <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c</a>,<a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>) for storing two dimensional arrays. For example, consider the following matrix:</p>\n\n<pre><code>1 2\n3 4\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In row-major ordering, this is stored in memory as <code>1 2 3 4</code>; in column-major ordering this would be stored as <code>1 3 2 4</code>. It is easy to see that implementations which do not exploit this ordering will quickly run into (easily avoidable!) cache issues. Unfortunately, I see stuff like this <em>very</em> often in my domain (machine learning). @MatteoItalia showed this example in more detail in his answer.</p>\n\n<p>When fetching a certain element of a matrix from memory, elements near it will be fetched as well and stored in a cache line. If the ordering is exploited, this will result in fewer memory accesses (because the next few values which are needed for subsequent computations are already in a cache line). </p>\n\n<p>For simplicity, assume the cache comprises a single cache line which can contain 2 matrix elements and that when a given element is fetched from memory, the next one is too. Say we want to take the sum over all elements in the example 2x2 matrix above (lets call it <code>M</code>):</p>\n\n<p>Exploiting the ordering (e.g. changing column index first in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>): </p>\n\n<pre><code>M[0][0] (memory) + M[0][1] (cached) + M[1][0] (memory) + M[1][1] (cached)\n= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n--&gt; 2 cache hits, 2 memory accesses\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not exploiting the ordering (e.g. changing row index first in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>):</p>\n\n<pre><code>M[0][0] (memory) + M[1][0] (memory) + M[0][1] (memory) + M[1][1] (memory)\n= 1 + 3 + 2 + 4\n--&gt; 0 cache hits, 4 memory accesses\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this simple example, exploiting the ordering approximately doubles execution speed (since memory access requires much more cycles than computing the sums). In practice the performance difference can be <em>much</em> larger.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoid unpredictable branches</strong></p>\n\n<p>Modern architectures feature pipelines and compilers are becoming very good at reordering code to minimize delays due to memory access. When your critical code contains (unpredictable) branches, it is hard or impossible to prefetch data. This will indirectly lead to more cache misses.</p>\n\n<p>This is explained <em>very</em> well here (thanks to @0x90 for the link): <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-processing-a-sorted-array-faster-than-an-unsorted-array\">Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Avoid virtual functions</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the context of <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%2b%2b\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c++&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c++</a>, <code>virtual</code> methods represent a controversial issue with regard to cache misses (a general consensus exists that they should be avoided when possible in terms of performance). Virtual functions can induce cache misses during look up, but this only happens <em>if</em> the specific function is not called often (otherwise it would likely be cached), so this is regarded as a non-issue by some. For reference about this issue, check out: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/667634/what-is-the-performance-cost-of-having-a-virtual-method-in-a-c-class\">What is the performance cost of having a virtual method in a C++ class?</a> </p>\n\n<h2>Common problems</h2>\n\n<p>A common problem in modern architectures with multiprocessor caches is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_sharing\">false sharing</a>. This occurs when each individual processor is attempting to use data in another memory region and attempts to store it in the same <em>cache line</em>. This causes the cache line -- which contains data another processor can use -- to be overwritten again and again. Effectively, different threads make each other wait by inducing cache misses in this situation.\nSee also (thanks to @Matt for the link): <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8469427/how-and-when-to-align-to-cache-line-size\">How and when to align to cache line size?</a></p>\n\n<p>An extreme symptom of poor caching in RAM memory (which is probably not what you mean in this context) is so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_%28computer_science%29\">thrashing</a>.

When you access a single memory address the CPU will go fetch it. in the old days it would fetch just that single address.

And the number of cache misses via just this simple transformation is reduced approximately 16-fold.</p>\n\n<p>Fancier transformations operate on 2D tiles, optimize for multiple caches (L1, L2, TLB), and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Some results of googling \"cache blocking\":</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://stumptown.cc.gt.atl.ga.us/cse6230-hpcta-fa11/slides/11a-matmul-goto.pdf\">http://stumptown.cc.gt.atl.ga.us/cse6230-hpcta-fa11/slides/11a-matmul-goto.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/cache-blocking-techniques\">http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/cache-blocking-techniques</a></p>\n\n<p>A nice video animation of an optimized cache blocking algorithm.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFWgwGMMrh0\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFWgwGMMrh0</a></p>\n\n<p>Loop tiling is very closely related:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_tiling\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_tiling</a></p>\n", "title": "What is &quot;cache-friendly&quot; code?", "answer_id": 16805194, "question_id": 16699247, "tags": ["c++", "performance", "caching", "memory", "cpu-cache"]}, {"body": "<p>Optimizing cache usage largely comes down to two factors.</p>\n\n<h1>Locality of Reference</h1>\n\n<p>The first factor (to which others have already alluded) is locality of reference. Locality of reference really has two dimensions though: space and time.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Spatial</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The spatial dimension also comes down to two things: first, we want to pack our information densely, so more information will fit in that limited memory. This means (for example) that you need a major improvement in computational complexity to justify data structures based on small nodes joined by pointers.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we want information that will be processed together also located together. A typical cache works in \"lines\", which means when you access some information, other information at nearby addresses will be loaded into the cache with the part we touched. For example, when I touch one byte, the cache might load 128 or 256 bytes near that one. To take advantage of that, you generally want the data arranged to maximize the likelihood that you'll also use that other data that was loaded at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>For just a really trivial example, this can mean that a linear search can be much more competitive with a binary search than you'd expect. Once you've loaded one item from a cache line, using the rest of the data in that cache line is almost free. A binary search becomes noticeably faster only when the data is large enough that the binary search reduces the number of cache lines you access.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The time dimension means that when you do some operations on some data, you want (as much as possible) to do all the operations on that data at once.</p>\n\n<p>Since you've tagged this as C++, I'll point to a classic example of a relatively cache-unfriendly design: <code>std::valarray</code>. <code>valarray</code> overloads most arithmetic operators, so I can (for example) say <code>a = b + c + d;</code> (where <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> and <code>d</code> are all valarrays) to do element-wise addition of those arrays.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this is that it walks through one pair of inputs, puts results in a temporary, walks through another pair of inputs, and so on. With a lot of data, the result from one computation may disappear from the cache before it's used in the next computation, so we end up reading (and writing) the data repeatedly before we get our final result. If each element of the final result will be something like <code>(a[n] + b[n]) * (c[n] + d[n]);</code>, we'd generally prefer to read each <code>a[n]</code>, <code>b[n]</code>, <code>c[n]</code> and <code>d[n]</code> once, do the computation, write the result, increment <code>n</code> and repeat 'til we're done.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<h1>Line Sharing</h1>\n\n<p>The second major factor is avoiding line sharing. To understand this, we probably need to back up and look a little at how caches are organized. The simplest form of cache is direct mapped. This means one address in main memory can only be stored in one specific spot in the cache. If we're using two data items that map to the same spot in the cache, it works badly -- each time we use one data item, the other has to be flushed from the cache to make room for the other. The rest of the cache might be empty, but those items won't use other parts of the cache.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent this, most caches are what are called \"set associative\". For example, in a 4-way set-associative cache, any item from main memory can be stored at any of 4 different places in the cache. So, when the cache is going to load an item, it looks for the least recently used<sup>3</sup> item among those four, flushes it to main memory, and loads the new item in its place.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is probably fairly obvious: for a direct-mapped cache, two operands that happen to map to the same cache location can lead to bad behavior. An N-way set-associative cache increases the number from 2 to N+1. Organizing a cache into more \"ways\" takes extra circuitry and generally runs slower, so (for example) an 8192-way set associative cache is rarely a good solution either.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, this factor is more difficult to control in portable code though. Your control over where your data is placed is usually fairly limited. Worse, the exact mapping from address to cache varies between otherwise similar processors. In some cases, however, it can be worth doing things like allocating a large buffer, and then using only parts of what you allocated to ensure against data sharing the same cache lines (even though you'll probably need to detect the exact processor and act accordingly to do this).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>False Sharing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There's another, related item called \"false sharing\". This arises in a multiprocessor or multicore system, where two (or more) processors/cores have data that's separate, but falls in the same cache line. This forces the two processors/cores to coordinate their access to the data, even though each has its own, separate data item. Especially if the two modify the data in alternation, this can lead to a massive slowdown as the data has to be constantly shuttled between the processors. This can't easily be cured by organizing the cache into more \"ways\" or anything like that either. The primary way to prevent it is to ensure that two threads rarely (preferably never) modify data that could possibly be in the same cache line (with the same caveats about difficulty of controlling the addresses at which data is allocated).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Those who know C++ well might wonder if this is open to optimization via something like expression templates. I'm pretty sure the answer is that yes, it could be done and if it was, it would probably be a pretty substantial win. I'm not aware of anybody having done so, however, and given how little <code>valarray</code> gets used, I'd be at least a little surprised to see anybody do so either.</p></li>\n<li><p>In case anybody wonders how <code>valarray</code> (designed specifically for performance) could be this badly wrong, it comes down to one thing: it was really designed for machines like the older Crays, that used fast main memory and no cache. For them, this really was a nearly ideal design.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes, I'm simplifying: most caches don't really measure the least recently used item precisely, but they use some heuristic that's intended to be close to that without having to keep a full time-stamp for each access.</p></li>\n</ol>\n", "title": "What is &quot;cache-friendly&quot; code?", "answer_id": 16863451, "question_id": 16699247, "tags": ["c++", "performance", "caching", "memory", "cpu-cache"]}, {"body": "<p>It needs to be clarified that not only data should be cache-friendly, it is just as important for the code. This is in addition to branch predicition, instruction reordering, avoiding actual divisions and other techniques.</p>\n\n<p>Typically the denser the code, the fewer cache lines will be required to store it. This results in more cache lines being available for data.</p>\n\n<p>The code should not call functions all over the place as they typically will require one or more cache lines of their own, resulting in fewer cache lines for data.</p>\n\n<p>A function should begin at a cache line-alignment-friendly address. Though there are (gcc) compiler switches for this be aware that if the the functions are very short it might be wasteful for each one to occupy an entire cache line. For example, if three of the most often used functions fit inside one 64 byte cache line, this is less wasteful than if each one has its own line and results in two cache lines less available for other usage. A typical alignment value could be 32 or 16.</p>\n\n<p>So spend some extra time to make the code dense.

In the case of HTTP, this interface consists of standard HTTP ops e.g. <code>GET</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>DELETE</code>.</p>\n\n<p>@Abdulaziz's question does illuminate the fact that <code>REST</code> and <code>HTTP</code> are often used in tandem. This is primarily due to the simplicity of HTTP and its very natural mapping to RESTful principles.</p>\n\n<h3>Fundamental REST Principles</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Client-Server Communication</strong></p>\n\n<p>Client-server architectures have a very distinct separation of concerns. All applications built in the RESTful style must also be client-server in principle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stateless</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each client request to the server requires that its state be fully represented. The server must be able to completely understand the client request without using any server context or server session state. It follows that all state must be kept on the client.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cacheable</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cache constraints may be used, thus enabling response data to be marked as cacheable or not-cacheable. Any data marked as cacheable may be reused as the response to the same subsequent request.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Uniform Interface</strong></p>\n\n<p>All components must interact through a single uniform interface. Because all component interaction occurs via this interface, interaction with different services is very simple. The interface is the same! This also means that implementation changes can be made in isolation. Such changes, will not affect fundamental component interaction because the uniform interface is always unchanged. One disadvantage is that you are stuck with the interface. If an optimization could be provided to a specific service by changing the interface, you are out of luck as REST prohibits this. On the bright side, however, REST is optimized for the web, hence incredible popularity of REST over HTTP!</p>\n\n<p>The above concepts represent defining characteristics of REST and differentiate the REST architecture from other architectures like web services. It is useful to note that a REST service is a web service, but a web service is not necessarily a REST service.</p>\n\n<p>See this blog <a href=\"http://www.carminedimascio.com/2013/09/06/restful-design-principles/\">post</a> on <strong>REST Design Principals</strong> for more details on <strong>REST</strong> and the above stated bullets.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>EDIT:</strong> update content based on comments</em></p>\n", "title": "SOAP vs REST (differences)", "answer_id": 19884368, "question_id": 19884295, "tags": ["web-services", "rest", "soap"]}, {"body": "<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of misinformation and misconceptions around REST. Not only your question and the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/19884368/282110\">answer by @cmd</a> reflect those, but most of the questions and answers related to the subject on Stack Overflow.</p>\n\n<p>SOAP and REST can't be compared directly, since the first is a protocol (or at least tries to be) and the second is an architectural style. This is probably one of the sources of confusion around it, since people tend to call REST any HTTP API that isn't SOAP.</p>\n\n<p>Pushing things a little and trying to establish a comparison, the main difference between SOAP and REST is the degree of coupling between client and server implementations. A SOAP client works like a custom desktop application, tightly coupled to the server. There's a rigid contract between client and server, and everything is expected to break if either side changes anything. You need constant updates following any change.</p>\n\n<p>A REST client is more like a browser. It's a generic client that knows how to use a protocol and standardized methods, and an application has to fit inside that. You don't violate the protocol standards by creating extra methods, you leverage on the standard methods and create the actions with them on your media type. If done right, there's less coupling, and changes can be dealt with more gracefully. A client is supposed to enter a REST service with zero knowledge of the API, except for the entry point and the media type. In SOAP, the client needs previous knowledge on everything he will be using, or it won't even begin the interaction. Additionally, a REST client can be extended by code-on-demand supplied by the server itself, the classical example being javascript code used to drive the interaction with another service on the client-side.</p>\n\n<p>I think these are the crucial points to understand what REST is about, and how it differs from SOAP:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>REST is protocol independent. It's not coupled to HTTP. Pretty much like you can follow an ftp link on a website, a REST application can use any protocol for which there is an standardized URI scheme.</p></li>\n<li><p>REST is not mapping CRUD to HTTP methods. Read <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19843480/s3-rest-api-and-post-method/19844272#19844272\">this</a> answer for a detailed explanation on that.</p></li>\n<li><p>REST is as standardized as the parts you're using. Security and authentication in HTTP is standardized, so that's what you use when doing REST over HTTP.</p></li>\n<li><p>REST is not REST without <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS\">HATEOAS</a>. This means that a client only knows the entry point URI and the resources are supposed to return links the client should follow. Those fancy documentation generators that give URI patterns for everything you can do in a REST API miss the point completely. They are not only documenting something that's supposed to be following the standard, but when you do that, you're coupling the client to one particular moment in the evolution of the API, and any changes on the API have to be documented and applied, or it will break.</p></li>\n<li><p>REST is the architectural style of the web itself. When you enter Stack Overflow, you know what a User, a Question and an Answer are, you know the media types, and the website provides you with the links to them. A REST API has to do the same. If we designed the web the way people think REST should be done, instead of having a home page with links to Questions and Answers, we'd have a static documentation explaining that in order to view a question, you have to take the URI <code>stackoverflow.com/questions/&lt;id&gt;</code>, replace id with the Question.id and paste that on your browser. That's nonsense, but that's what many people think REST is.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This last point can't be emphasized enough. If your clients are building URIs from templates in documentation and not getting links in the resource representations, that's not REST. Roy Fielding, the author of REST, made it clear on this blog post: <a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven\">REST APIs must be hypertext-driven</a>. </p>\n\n<p>With the above in mind, you'll realize that while REST might not be restricted to XML, to do it correctly with any other format you'll have to design and standardize some format for your links. Hyperlinks are standard in XML, but not in JSON. There are draft standards for JSON, like <a href=\"http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html\">HAL</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, REST isn't for everyone, and a proof of that is how most people solve their problems very well with the HTTP APIs they call REST and never venture beyond that. REST is hard to do sometimes, especially in the beginning, but it pays over time with easier evolution on the server side, and client's resilience to changes. If you need something done quickly and easily, don't bother about getting REST right. It's probably not what you're looking for. If you need something that will have to stay online for years or even decades, then REST is for you.</p>\n", "title": "SOAP vs REST (differences)", "answer_id": 19884975, "question_id": 19884295, "tags": ["web-services", "rest", "soap"]}, {"body": "<p>SOAP (<strong>Simple Object Access Protocol</strong>) and REST (<strong>Representation State Transfer</strong>) both are beautiful in their own way. So I am not comparing them, instead, I am trying to depict the picture, when I preferred to use REST and when SOAP.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is payload?</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When data is sent over the Internet, each unit transmitted includes both header information and the actual data being sent. The header identifies the source and destination of the packet, <strong>while the actual data is referred to as the payload</strong>. In general, payload is the data that is carried on behalf of an application and the data received by the destination system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now for example I have to send a <strong>Telegram</strong> and we all know that the cost of the telegram will depend on number of words.</p>\n\n<p><em>So tell me among below mentioned these two messages, which one is cheaper to send?</em></p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;name&gt;Arin&lt;/name&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>or </p>\n\n<pre><code>\"name\": \"Arin\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I know your answer will be second one although both representing the same message second one is cheaper in terms of cost.</p>\n\n<p>So I am trying to say that, <strong>sending data over the network in Json format is cheaper than sending it in Xml format in terms of payload</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is the first benefit or advantages of REST over SOAP</strong>. SOAP only support XML, but REST supports different format like text, JSON, XML etc. And we already know, if we use Json then definitely we will be in better place in terms of payload.</p>\n\n<p>Now, SOAP supports only XML, <strong>but it also has its own advantages.</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Really! How?</strong></p>\n\n<p>SOAP relies on XML in three ways \nEnvelope \u2013 that defines what is in the message and how to process it.</p>\n\n<p>A set of encoding rules for data types, and finally the layout of the procedure calls and responses gathered. </p>\n\n<p>This envelope is sent via a transport (HTTP/HTTPS), and an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is executed and the envelope is returned with information in a XML formatted document.</p>\n\n<p>Here important point is that <strong>one of the advantages of SOAP</strong> is the use of the <strong>\u201cgeneric\u201d transport</strong> but <strong>REST uses HTTP/HTTPS</strong>. SOAP can use almost any transport to send the request but REST cannot. So here we got an advantage of using SOAP.</p>\n\n<p>As I already mentioned in above paragraph <strong>\u201cREST uses HTTP/HTTPS\u201d</strong>, so go bit deeper on these words.</p>\n\n<p>When we are talking about REST over HTTP, all security measures applied HTTP are inherited and this is known as <strong>transport level security</strong> and it secures messages only while <strong>it is inside the wire</strong> but once you delivered it on the other side you don\u2019t really know how many stages it will have to go through before reaching the real point where the data will be processed. And of course all those stages could use something different than HTTP.<strong>So Rest is not safer completely, right?</strong></p>\n\n<p>But SOAP <strong>supports SSL</strong> just like REST additionally <strong>it also supports WS-Security</strong> which adds some enterprise security features. WS-Security offers protection from the <strong>creation of the message to it\u2019s consumption</strong>. So for transport level security whatever loophole we found that can be prevented using WS-Security.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from that, as <strong>REST is limited by it's HTTP protocol</strong> so it\u2019s transaction support is neither ACID compliant nor can provide two phase commit across distributed transnational resources.</p>\n\n<p>But SOAP has comprehensive support for both <strong>ACID based transaction management</strong> for short-lived transactions and compensation based transaction management for long-running transactions. It also supports <strong>two-phase commit across distributed resources</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>I am not drawing any conclusion, but I will definitely prefer SOAP based web service while security, transaction etc are the main concerns. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the \"The Java EE 6 Tutorial\" where they have said <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/giqsx.html\">A RESTful design may be appropriate when the following conditions are met</a>.

XML, JSON RESTful Web Services A RESTFul web services are based on HTTP methods and the concept of REST. A RESTFul web service typically defines the base URI for the services, the supported MIME-types (XML, text, JSON, user-defined, ...) and the set of operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) which are supported.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>SOAP fundamentals</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>WSDL defines contract between client and service and is static by its nature.</li>\n<li>SOAP builds an XML based protocol on top of HTTP or sometimes TCP/IP.</li>\n<li>SOAP describes functions, and types of data.</li>\n<li>SOAP is a successor of XML-RPC and is very similar, but describes a standard way to communicate.</li>\n<li>Several programming languages have native support for SOAP, you typically feed it a web service URL and you can call its web service functions without the need of specific code.</li>\n<li>Binary data that is sent must be encoded first into a format such as base64 encoded.</li>\n<li>Has several protocols and technologies relating to it: WSDL, XSDs, SOAP, WS-Addressing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>SOAP vs REST?</strong></p>\n\n<p>One of the major benefits of SOAP is that you have a WSDL service description. You can pretty much discover the service automatically and generate a useable client proxy from that service description (generate the service calls, the necessary data types for the methods and so forth). Note that with version 2.0, WSDL supports all HTTP verbs and can be used to document RESTful services as well, but there is a less verbose alternative in WADL (Web Application Description Language) for that purpose.</p>\n\n<p>With RESTful services, message security is provided by the transport protocol (HTTPS), and is point-to-point only. It doesn\u2019t have a standard messaging system and expects clients to deal with communication failures by retrying. SOAP has successful/retry logic built in and provides end-to-end reliability even through SOAP intermediaries.</p>\n\n<p>One of the major benefits of RESTful API is that it is flexible for data representation, for example you could serialize your data in either XML or JSON format. RESTful APIs are cleaner or easier to understand because they add an element of using standardised URIs and gives importance to HTTP verb used (i.e. GET, POST, PUT and DELETE).</p>\n\n<p>RESTful services are also lightweight, that is they don\u2019t have a lot of extra xml markup. To invoke RESTful API all you need is a browser or HTTP stack and pretty much every device or machine connected to a network has that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages of REST</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since REST uses standard HTTP it is much simpler in just about ever way. Creating clients, developing APIs, the documentation is much easier to understand and there aren\u2019t very many things that REST doesn\u2019t do easier/better than SOAP.</li>\n<li>REST permits many different data formats where as SOAP only permits XML. While this may seem like it adds complexity to REST because you need to handle multiple formats, in my experience it has actually been quite beneficial. JSON usually is a better fit for data and parses much faster. REST allows better support for browser clients due to it\u2019s support for JSON.</li>\n<li>REST has better performance and scalability.

Supports identity through intermediaries, not just point to point (SSL). It also provides a standard implementation of data integrity and data privacy. Calling it \u201cEnterprise\u201d isn\u2019t to say it\u2019s more secure, it simply supports some security tools that typical internet services have no need for, in fact they are really only needed in a few \u201centerprise\u201d scenarios.</li>\n<li><strong>WS-AtomicTransaction :</strong> Need ACID Transactions over a service, you\u2019re going to need SOAP. While REST supports transactions, it isn\u2019t as comprehensive and isn\u2019t ACID compliant. Fortunately ACID transactions almost never make sense over the internet. REST is limited by HTTP itself which can\u2019t provide two-phase commit across distributed transactional resources, but SOAP can. Internet apps generally don\u2019t need this level of transactional reliability, enterprise apps sometimes do.</li>\n<li><strong>WS-ReliableMessaging :</strong> Rest doesn\u2019t have a standard messaging system and expects clients to deal with communication failures by retrying.

Plus, any browser can be used because the REST approach uses the standard GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE verbs. Again, remember that REST can also use the XMLHttpRequest object that most modern browsers support today, which adds an extra bonus of AJAX.</li>\n<li><strong>Totally stateless operations:</strong> if an operation needs to be continued, then REST is not the best approach and SOAP may fit it better. However, if you need stateless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations, then REST is it.</li>\n<li><strong>Caching situations:</strong> if the information can be cached because of the totally stateless operation of the REST approach, this is perfect.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Where to use SOAP</strong></p>\n\n<p>areas where SOAP works as a great solutionare:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Asynchronous processing and invocation:</strong> if your application needs a guaranteed level of reliability and security then SOAP 1.2 offers additional standards to ensure this type of operation. Things like WSRM \u2013 WS-Reliable Messaging.</li>\n<li><strong>Formal contracts:</strong> if both sides (provider and consumer) have to agree on the exchange format then SOAP 1.2 gives the rigid specifications for this type of interaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Stateful operations:</strong> if the application needs contextual information and conversational state management then SOAP 1.2 has the additional specification in the WS structure to support those things (Security, Transactions, Coordination, etc). Comparatively, the REST approach would make the developers build this custom plumbing.</li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "SOAP vs REST (differences)", "answer_id": 36767850, "question_id": 19884295, "tags": ["web-services", "rest", "soap"]}, {"body": "<p>Well, I am seeing a lot of new web services are implemented using a REST style architecture these days rather than a SOAP one.

You can get the contents of that object using an HTTP GET, to delete it, you then might use a POST, PUT, or DELETE to modify the object (in practice most of the services use a POST for this).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who's using REST?</strong></p>\n\n<p>All of Yahoo's web services use REST, including Flickr, del.icio.us API uses it, pubsub, bloglines, technorati, and both eBay, and Amazon have web services for both REST and SOAP.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who's using SOAP?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Google seams to be consistent in implementing their web services to use SOAP, with the exception of Blogger, which uses XML-RPC.

On the converse, Amazon's REST web service can sometimes be tricky to parse because it can be highly nested, and the result schema can vary quite a bit based on what you search for.</p>\n\n<p>Which ever architecture you choose make sure its easy for developers to access it, and well documented.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hoping this will help you :)</strong></p>\n", "title": "SOAP vs REST (differences)", "answer_id": 39444344, "question_id": 19884295, "tags": ["web-services", "rest", "soap"]}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19884295/soap-vs-rest-differences", "question_id": 19884295}, {"body": "<p>I'm using Twitter Bootstrap 3, and I have problems when I want to align vertically two <code>div</code>, for example \u2014 <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/corinem/CQstd/\">JSFiddle link</a>:</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override\"><code>&lt;!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS --&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- Optional theme --&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css\"&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript --&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=\"https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=\"col-xs-5\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;div style=\"height:5em;border:1px solid #000\"&gt;Big&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=\"col-xs-5\"&gt;\r\n    &lt;div style=\"height:3em;border:1px solid #F00\"&gt;Small&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>The grid system in Bootstrap uses <code>float: left</code>, not <code>display:inline-block</code>, so the property <code>vertical-align</code> doesn't work.

It lacks many of\n  the more complex text- or document-centric properties that can be used\n  in block layout, such as floats and columns.

Well, Let's see.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Vertical aligned columns</h1>\n\n<p>Using twitter bootstrap we have <code>.row</code>s having some <code>.col-*</code>s.

For instance:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>/* Extra small devices (767px and down) */\n@media (max-width: 767px) { \n    .row.vertical-align {\n        display: block; /* turn off the flexible box layout */\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or you could <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/hashem/g6puyohg/6/\">specify <code>.vertical-align</code> <strong>only</strong> on specific screen sizes</a> like so:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */\n@media (min-width: 768px) { \n    .row.vertical-align {\n        display: flex;\n        align-items: center;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In that case, I'd go with <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/482256/kevin-nelson\">@KevinNelson</a>'s <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/a/27771750/1725764\">approach</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important note #2:</strong> Vendor prefixes omitted due to brevity. Flexbox syntax has been changed during the time. The new written syntax won't work on older versions of web browsers (but not that old as IE9! Flexbox is supported on IE10+).</p>\n\n<p>This means you should also use vendor-prefixed properties like <code>display: -webkit-box</code> and so on in production mode.</p>\n\n<p>If you click on <em>\"Toggle Compiled View\"</em> in the <a href=\"http://codepen.io/hashem/pen/Lsprw?editors=110\">Demo</a>, you'll see the prefixed version of CSS declarations (Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer\">Autoprefixer</a>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h1>Full-height columns with vertical aligned contents</h1>\n\n<p>As you see in the <a href=\"http://codepen.io/hashem/pen/Lsprw?editors=110\">previous demo</a>, columns (the flex items) are no longer as high as their container (the flex container box. i.e. the <code>.row</code> element).</p>\n\n<p>This is because of using <code>center</code> value for <code>align-items</code> property. The default value is <code>stretch</code> so that the items can fill the entire height of the parent element.</p>\n\n<p>In order to fix that, you can add <code>display: flex;</code> to the columns as well:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://codepen.io/hashem/pen/zwJaE\">EXAMPLE HERE</a></strong> <em>(Again, mind the comments)</em></p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-css prettyprint-override\"><code>.vertical-align {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n}\n\n.vertical-align &gt; [class^=\"col-\"],\n.vertical-align &gt; [class*=\" col-\"] {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;     /* Align the flex-items vertically */\n  justify-content: center; /* Optional, to align inner flex-items \n                              horizontally within the column  */\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>The Output</h3>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/d2o3b.jpg\" alt=\"Full-height columns with vertical aligned contents in Twitter Bootstrap\"></p>\n\n<p><em>Colored area displays the padding-box of columns.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Last but not least</strong>, notice that the demos and code snippets here are meant to give you a different idea, to provide a modern approach to achieve the goal.

Here is an explanation with examples:</p>\n\n<h2>1) DRYing up model codes</h2>\n\n<p>Consider a Article model, a Event model and a Comment model. An article or an event has many comments. A comment belongs to either Article or Event. </p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, the models may look like this:</p>\n\n<p>Comment Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Article Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :comments, as: :commentable \n\n  def find_first_comment\n    comments.first(created_at DESC)\n  end\n\n  def self.least_commented\n   #return the article with least number of comments\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Event Model</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :comments, as: :commentable \n\n  def find_first_comment\n    comments.first(created_at DESC)\n  end\n\n  def self.least_commented\n   #returns the event with least number of comments\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As we can notice, there is a significant piece of code common to both Event and Article. Using concerns we can extract this common code in a separate module Commentable. </p>\n\n<p>For this create a commentable.rb file in app/models/concerns.</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Commentable\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n\n  included do\n    has_many :comments, as: :commentable\n  end\n\n  # for the given article/event returns the first comment\n  def find_first_comment\n    comments.first(created_at DESC)\n  end\n\n  module ClassMethods\n    def least_commented\n      #returns the article/event which has the least number of comments\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now your models look like this :</p>\n\n<p>Comment Model: </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :commentable, polymorphic: true\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Article Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  include Commentable\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Event Model:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  include Commentable\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>2) Skin-nizing Fat Models.</h2>\n\n<p>Consider a Event model. A event has many attenders and comments.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, the event model might look like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base   \n  has_many :comments\n  has_many :attenders\n\n\n  def find_first_comment\n    # for the given article/event returns the first comment\n  end\n\n  def find_comments_with_word(word)\n    # for the given event returns an array of comments which contain the given word\n  end \n\n  def self.least_commented\n    # finds the event which has the least number of comments\n  end\n\n  def self.most_attended\n    # returns the event with most number of attendes\n  end\n\n  def has_attendee(attendee_id)\n    # returns true if the event has the mentioned attendee\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Models with many associations and otherwise have tendency to accumulate more and more code and become unmanageable. Concerns provide a way to skin-nize fat modules making them more modularized and easy to understand. </p>\n\n<p>The above model can be refactored using concerns as below:\nCreate a <code>attendable.rd</code> and <code>commentable.rb</code> file in app/models/concerns/event folder</p>\n\n<p>attendable.rb</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Attendable\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n\n  included do \n    has_many :attenders\n  end\n\n  def has_attender(attender_id)\n    # returns true if the event has the mentioned attendee\n  end\n\n  module ClassMethods\n    def most_attended\n      # returns the event with most number of attendes\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>commentable.rb</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Commentable\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n\n  included do \n    has_many :comments\n  end\n\n  def find_first_comment\n    # for the given article/event returns the first comment\n  end\n\n  def find_comments_with_word(word)\n    # for the given event returns an array of comments which contain the given word\n  end\n\n  module ClassMethods\n    def least_commented\n      # finds the event which has the least number of comments\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And now using Concerns, your Event model reduces to </p>\n\n<pre><code>class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\n  include Commentable\n  include Attendable\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>* While using concerns its advisable to go for 'domain' based grouping rather than 'technical' grouping.

Thats one advantage of using <code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Handle module dependencies gracefully.</p>\n\n<pre><code>module Foo\n  def self.included(base)\n    base.class_eval do\n      def self.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n        ...\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nmodule Bar\n  def self.included(base)\n    base.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n  end\nend\n\nclass Host\n  include Foo # We need to include this dependency for Bar\n  include Bar # Bar is the module that Host really needs\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example <code>Bar</code> is the module that <code>Host</code> really needs. But since <code>Bar</code> has dependency with <code>Foo</code> the <code>Host</code> class have to <code>include Foo</code> (but wait why <code>Host</code> want to know about <code>Foo</code> ? can it be avoided ?).</p>\n\n<p>So <code>Bar</code> adds dependency everywhere it goes. And <strong>order of inclusion also matters here.</strong> This adds lot of complexity/dependency to huge code base.</p>\n\n<p>After refactoring with <code>ActiveSupport::Concern</code></p>\n\n<pre><code>require 'active_support/concern'\n\nmodule Foo\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n  included do\n    def self.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n      ...\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nmodule Bar\n  extend ActiveSupport::Concern\n  include Foo\n\n  included do\n    self.method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass\n  end\nend\n\nclass Host\n  include Bar # It works, now Bar takes care of its dependencies\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now it looks simple.</p>\n\n<p>If you are thinking why cant we add <code>Foo</code> dependency in <code>Bar</code> module itself ? That wont work since <code>method_injected_by_foo_to_host_klass</code> have to be injected in class thats including <code>Bar</code> not on <code>Bar</code> module itself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Concern.html\">Rails ActiveSupport::Concern</a></p>\n", "title": "How to use concerns in Rails 4", "answer_id": 34061862, "question_id": 14541823, "tags": ["ruby-on-rails", "ruby-on-rails-4", "dci"]}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14541823/how-to-use-concerns-in-rails-4", "question_id": 14541823}, {"body": "<p>When I do <code>git diff COMMIT</code> I see the changes between that commit and HEAD (afaik) but I would like to see the changes that were made by that single commit.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't found any obvious options on diff/log that will give me that output.</p>\n", "title": "How to see the changes in a commit?", "tags": ["git", "version-control", "diff", "git-diff"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>To see the diff for a particular  <code>COMMIT</code> hash:</p>\n\n<p><code>git diff COMMIT^ COMMIT</code> will show you the difference between that <code>COMMIT</code>'s ancestor and the <code>COMMIT</code>.

That's where lambda expressions come into play. Since Java 8 it is allowed to do the same thing in a much shorter way:</p>\n\n<pre><code>reduce( (int left, int right) -&gt; Math.max(left, right) );\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>How does this work? The java compiler \"detects\", that you want to implement a method that accepts two <code>int</code>s and returns one <code>int</code>. This is equivalent to the formal parameters of the one and only method of interface <code>IntBinaryOperator</code> (the parameter of method <code>reduce</code> you want to call). So the compiler does the rest for you - it just assumes you want to implement <code>IntBinaryOperator</code>.</p>\n\n<p>But as <code>Math.max(int, int)</code> itself fulfills the formal requirements of <code>IntBinaryOperator</code>, it can be used directly. Because Java 7 does not have any syntax that allows a method itself to be passed as an argument (you can only pass method results, but never method references), the <code>::</code> syntax was introduced in Java 8 to reference methods:</p>\n\n<pre><code>reduce(Math::max);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that this will be interpreted by the compiler, not by the JVM at runtime! Although it produces different bytecodes for all three code snippets, they are semantically equal, so the last two can be considered to be short (and probably more efficient) versions of the <code>IntBinaryOperator</code> implementation above!</p>\n\n<p>(See also <a href=\"http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-translation.html\">Translation of Lambda Expressions</a>)</p>\n", "title": ":: (double colon) operator in Java 8", "answer_id": 20001866, "question_id": 20001427, "tags": ["java", "java-8"]}, {"body": "<p><code>::</code> is called Method Reference. It is basically a reference to a single method. i.e. it refers to an existing method by name.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Explanation</strong>:\nBelow is an example of a reference to a static method:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Hey{\n     public static double square(double num){\n        return Math.pow(num , 2);\n    }\n}\n\nFunction&lt;Double, Double&gt; square = Hey::square;\ndouble ans = square.apply(23d);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>square</code> can be passed around just like object reference's and trigger when at need. In fact, it can be perfectly used as a reference to a normal method of an object and not just <code>static</code> ones. </p>\n\n<pre><code> class Hey{\n     public double square(double num){\n        return Math.pow(num , 2);\n    }\n}\n\nHey hey = new Hey();\nFunction&lt;Double, Double&gt; square = hey::square;\ndouble ans = square.apply(23d);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>Function</code> above is a <strong>functional interface</strong>. Well to fully explain <code>::</code>, it is important to understand Functional Interface. Plainly, <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/FunctionalInterface.html\">Function interface</a> is an interface with just one abstract method. </p>\n\n<p>For example: <code>Runnable</code>, <code>Callable</code>, <code>ActionListener</code> and so. </p>\n\n<p><code>Function</code> above is a functional interface with just one method <code>apply</code>. It takes one argument and produces a result. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The reason why <code>::</code> are awesome is because:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Method references are expressions which have the same treatment as\n  lambda's, but instead of providing a lambda body, they refer an existing method by name</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i.e. Just like writing lambda body:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Function&lt;Double, Double&gt; square = (Double x) -&gt; x * x;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can simply do:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Function&lt;Double, Double&gt; square = Hey::square;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>At runtime they behave exactly the same. The bytecode may/not be the same (For above case, it generates the same bytecode (compile above and check <code>javap -c</code>))</p>\n\n<p>The only major criteria to satisfy is: the method you provide should have a similar signature to method of the FunctionalInterface you use as object reference. Below is illegal </p>\n\n<pre><code>Supplier&lt;Boolean&gt; p = Hey::square; //illegal\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>square</code> expects an argument and returns a double. <code>get</code> method in <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/function/Supplier.html\">Supplier</a> expects an argument but doesn't return anything. So it is an error. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Method Reference refers to a method of the functional interface</strong> (As mentioned, functional interface can only have one method). </p>\n\n<p>Some more examples: <code>accept</code> method in <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/function/Consumer.html\">Consumer</a> takes an input but doesnt return anything.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Consumer&lt;Integer&gt; b1 = System::exit;   // void exit(int status)\nConsumer&lt;String[]&gt; b2 = Arrays::sort;  // void sort(Object[] a)\nConsumer&lt;String&gt; b3 = MyProgram::main; // void main(String... args)\n\nclass Hey{\n    public double getRandom(){\n        return Math.random();\n    }\n}\n\nCallable&lt;Double&gt; call = hey::getRandom;\nSupplier&lt;Double&gt; call2 = hey::getRandom;\nDoubleSupplier sup = hey::getRandom;\n//Supplier is functional interface that takes no argument and gives a result\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Above <code>getRandom</code> takes no argument and returns a double. So any functional interface that satisfies the criteria of: <code>take no argument and return double</code> can be used. </p>\n\n<p>Another example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; set = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\nset.addAll(Arrays.asList(\"leo\",\"bale\",\"hanks\"));\nPredicate&lt;String&gt; pred = set::contains;\nboolean exists = pred.test(\"leo\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>In case of Parametrized Types</strong>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Param&lt;T&gt;{\n    T elem;\n    public T get(){\n        return elem;\n    }\n\n    public void set(T elem){\n        this.elem = elem;\n    }\n    public static &lt;E&gt; E returnSame(E elem){\n        return elem;\n    }\n}\n\nSupplier&lt;Param&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; obj = Param&lt;Integer&gt;::new;\nParam&lt;Integer&gt; param = obj.get();\nConsumer&lt;Integer&gt; c = param::set;\nSupplier&lt;Integer&gt; s = param::get;\n\n    Function&lt;String, String&gt; func = Param::&lt;String&gt;returnSame;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Method Reference can be obtained in different styles, but fundamentally they all mean the same and can simply be visualized as a lambda:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A static method (<code>ClassName::methName</code>)</li>\n<li>An instance method of a particular object (<code>instanceRef::methName</code>)</li>\n<li>A super method of a particular object (<code>super::methName</code>)</li>\n<li>An instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type (<code>ClassName::methName</code>)</li>\n<li>A class constructor reference (<code>ClassName::new</code>)</li>\n<li>An array constructor reference (<code>TypeName[]::new</code>)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For further reference: <a href=\"http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-state-final.html\">http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/lambda/lambda-state-final.html</a></p>\n", "title": ":: (double colon) operator in Java 8", "answer_id": 22245383, "question_id": 20001427, "tags": ["java", "java-8"]}, {"body": "<p><code>::</code> is a new operator included in Java 8 that is used to refer a method of an existing class.

I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.</p>\n\n<p>One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about \"big data\" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.</p>\n\n<p>My first thought is to use <code>HDFStore</code> to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:</p>\n\n<p>What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure</li>\n<li>Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure</li>\n<li>Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on \"large data\".</p>\n\n<p>Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.</li>\n<li>In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.</li>\n<li>I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.</li>\n<li>I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.</li>\n<li>Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, <code>if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'</code>.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.</li>\n<li>Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.</li>\n<li>A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.</li>\n<li>It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.</li>\n<li>The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).</p>\n", "title": "&quot;Large data&quot; work flows using pandas", "tags": ["python", "mongodb", "pandas", "large-data", "hdf5"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>I routinely use tens of gigabytes of data in just this fashion\ne.g. I have tables on disk that I read via queries, create data and append back.</p>\n\n<p>It's worth reading <a href=\"http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/io.html#hdf5-pytables\" rel=\"nofollow\">the docs</a> and <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/m/?fromgroups#!topic/pydata/cmw1F3OFJSc\" rel=\"nofollow\">late in this thread</a> for several suggestions for how to store your data.</p>\n\n<p>Details which will affect how you store your data, like:<br>\n<em>Give as much detail as you can; and I can help you develop a structure.</em></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Size of data, # of rows, columns, types of columns; are you appending\nrows, or just columns? </li>\n<li>What will typical operations look like.

I usually don't worry about semantics but his comment is very appropriate and informative.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Although there are already a bunch of good replies, you indicated that your <strong>professor</strong> prompted you to post this question so it appears you are (formally) <em>in school</em>.  I thought I would expound a little bit more in depth about not only CSS but also the <em>mechanics</em> of web browsers.  According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets\">Wikipedia</a>, \"CSS is a style sheet language used for describing ... a document written in <em><strong>a</strong></em> markup language.\"  (I added the emphasis on \"a\") Notice that it doesn't say \"written in HTML\" much less a specific version of HTML.  CSS can be used on HTML, XHTML, XML, SGML, XAML, etc.  Of course, you need something that will <em>render</em> each of these document types that will also apply styling.  By definition, CSS does not <strong>know / understand / care about</strong> specific markup language tags.  So, the tags may be \"invalid\" as far as HTML is concerned, but there is no concept of a \"valid\" tag/element/type in CSS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Modern</strong> visual browsers are not monolithic programs.  They are an amalgam of different \"engines\" that have specific jobs to do.  At a <em>bare minimum</em> I can think of 3 engines, the rendering engine, the CSS engine, and the javascript engine/VM.  Not sure if the parser is part of the rendering engine (or vice versa) or if it is a separate engine, but you get the idea.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not a <strong>visual</strong> browser (<strike>others have already addressed the fact that screen <em>readers</em> might have other challenges dealing with invalid tags</strike>) applies the formatting depends on whether the parser leaves the \"invalid\" tag in the document and then whether the rendering engine applies styles to that tag.  Since it would make it more difficult to develop/maintain, CSS engines are not written to <em>understand</em> that \"This is an HTML document so here are the list of valid tags / elements / types.\"  CSS engines simply find <em>tags / elements / types</em> and then tell the rendering engine, \"Here are the styles you should apply.\"  Whether or not the rendering engine decides to actually apply the styles is up it.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an easy way to think of the <strong><em>basic</em></strong> flow from engine to engine: parser -> CSS -> rendering.  In reality it is much more convoluted but this is good enough for starters.</p>\n\n<p>This answer is already too long so I will end there.</p>\n", "title": "Why does CSS work with fake elements?", "answer_id": 20356706, "question_id": 20353613, "tags": ["html", "css"]}, {"body": "<p>Others have made excellent points but its worth noting that if you look at a framework such as <a href=\"http://angularjs.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">AngularJS</a>, there is a very valid case for custom elements and attributes.

Clients send requests through startService(Intent) calls; the service is started as needed, handles each Intent in turn using a worker thread, and stops itself when it runs out of work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Design pattern used in IntentService</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>:\nThis \"work queue processor\" pattern is commonly used to offload tasks from an application's main thread. The IntentService class exists to simplify this pattern and take care of the mechanics. To use it, extend IntentService and implement onHandleIntent(Intent). IntentService will receive the Intents, launch a worker thread, and stop the service as appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>All requests are handled on a single worker thread -- they may take as long as necessary (and will not block the application's main loop), but only one request will be processed at a time.</p>\n\n<p>The IntentService class provides a straightforward structure for running an operation on a single background thread. This allows it to handle long-running operations without affecting your user interface's responsiveness. Also, an IntentService isn't affected by most user interface lifecycle events, so it continues to run in circumstances that would shut down an AsyncTask.</p>\n\n<p>An IntentService has a few limitations:</p>\n\n<p>It can't interact directly with your user interface. To put its results in the UI, you have to send them to an Activity.\nWork requests run sequentially. If an operation is running in an IntentService, and you send it another request, the request waits until the first operation is finished.\nAn operation running on an IntentService can't be interrupted.\nHowever, in most cases</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IntentService is the preferred way to simple background operations</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>**</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Volley Library</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is library called <a href=\"http://java.dzone.com/articles/android-%E2%80%93-volley-library\">volley-library for developing android networking applications</a>\nSource code is available for public in github.</p>\n\n<p>The android official documentation for  <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/best-background.html\">Best practices for Background jobs</a>:\nhelps better understand on intent service, thread, handler, service. and also <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/index.html\">Performing Network Operations</a></p>\n", "title": "Service vs IntentService", "answer_id": 20882900, "question_id": 15524280, "tags": ["android", "multithreading", "android-service", "android-intentservice"]}, {"body": "<p>main difference :</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Service class needs a manual stop using stopSelf().

Are really the controllers shared or is it just the scope properties?</p>\n", "title": "AngularJS : link vs compile vs controller", "tags": ["angularjs", "angularjs-directive"], "answers": [{"body": "<p><strong>Compile :</strong> </p>\n\n<p>This is the phase where Angular actually compiles your directive. This compile function is called just once for each references to the given directive. For example, say you are using the ng-repeat directive. ng-repeat will have to look up the element it is attached to, extract the html fragment that it is attached to and create a template function. </p>\n\n<p>If you have used HandleBars, underscore templates or equivalent, its like compiling their templates to extract out a template function. To this template function you pass data and the return value of that function is the html with the data in the right places. </p>\n\n<p>The compilation phase is that step in Angular which returns the template function. This template function in angular is called the linking function. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Linking phase :</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The linking phase is where you attach the data ( $scope ) to the linking function and it should return you the linked html. Since the directive also specifies where this html goes or what it changes, it is already good to go. This is the function where you want to make changes to the linked html, i.e the html that already has the data attached to it. In angular if you write code in the linking function its generally the post-link function (by default). It is kind of a callback that gets called after the linking function has linked the data with the template.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Controller :</strong></p>\n\n<p>The controller is a place where you put in some directive specific logic. This logic can go into the linking function as well, but then you would have to put that logic on the scope to make it \"shareable\". The problem with that is that you would then be corrupting the scope with your directives stuff which is not really something that is expected.\nSo what is the alternative if two Directives want to talk to each other / co-operate with each other? Ofcourse you could put all that logic into a service and then make both these directives depend on that service but that just brings in one more dependency. The alternative is to provide a Controller for this scope ( usually isolate scope ? ) and then this controller is injected into another directive when that directive \"requires\" the other one.

So basically you will have the same number of <code>Activities</code> in your application as the number of flows.\nThat way the action bar stays intact on all the flow's screens, but is being recreated on changing a flow which makes a lot of sense. As Eric Burke states and as I have come to realize as well, the philosophy of using as few <code>Activities</code> as possible is not applicable for all situations because it creates a mess in what he calls the \"God\" activity. </p>\n", "title": "Dilemma: when to use Fragments vs Activities:", "tags": ["android", "android-fragments", "android-activity"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>Well, according to Google's lectures (maybe <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amZM8oZBgfk\"><strong>here</strong></a>, I don't remember) , you should consider using Fragments whenever it's possible, as it makes your code easier to maintain and control.</p>\n\n<p>However, I think that on some cases it can get too complex, as the activity that hosts the fragments need to navigate/communicate between them.</p>\n\n<p>I think you should decide by yourself what's best for you.

If you use a new box, will you have to copy multiple items from the 1st box? If the answer is Yes, then you should use Fragments, because the root <code>Activity</code> can hold all duplicated elements to save you time in creating them, and you can simply replace parts of the box. </p>\n\n<p>But <strong>don't forget</strong> that you always need a box container (<code>Activity</code>) or your parts will be dispersed.

Now to see any variation at all one has to be assuming that the container in some way is flexible in size. Whether through a direct percentage <code>width</code> or through being 100% minus margins. The point becomes \"moot\" if the container is always set to, let's say, <code>200px</code> wide--then just set a <code>font-size</code> that works for that width.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>\n\n<p>With a flexible width container, however, it must be realized that in some way the container is <strong><em>still being sized off the view port</em></strong>. As such, it is a matter of adjusting a <code>vw</code> setting based off that percentage size difference to the view port, which means taking into account the sizing of parent wrappers. <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/T84wL/1/\"><strong>Take this example</strong></a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>div {\n    width: 50%;\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    margin: 20px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    /* 100 = view port width, as 1vw = 1/100th of that\n       So if the container is 50% of view port (as here)\n       then factor that into how you want it to size.\n       Let's say you like 5vw if it were the whole width,\n       then for this container, size it at 2.5vw (5 * .5 [i.e. 50%])\n    */\n    font-size: 2.5vw; \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Assuming here the <code>div</code> is a child of the <code>body</code>, it is <code>50%</code> of that <code>100%</code> width, which is the viewport size in this basic case. Basically, you want to set a <code>vw</code> that is going to look good to you. As you can see in my comment in the above css, you can \"think\" through that mathematically with respect to the full viewport size, but you don't <em>need</em> to do that. The text is going to \"flex\" with the container, because the container is flexing with the viewport resizing. UPDATE: <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/T84wL/6/\">here's an example of two differently sized containers</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can help insure viewport sizing by forcing the calculation based off that. <a href=\"http://jsfiddle.net/T84wL/3/\"><strong>Consider this example</strong></a>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>html {width: 100%;} /* force html to be viewport width */\nbody {width: 150%; } /* overflow the body */\n\ndiv {\n    width: 50%;\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    margin: 20px;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    /* 100 = view port width, as 1vw = 1/100th of that\n       Here, the body is 200% of viewport, but the container is 50% \n       of view port, so both parents factor  into how you want it to size.\n       Let's say you like 5vw if it were the whole width,\n       then for this container, size it at 3.75vw \n       (5 * 1.5 [i.e. 150%]) * .5 [i.e. 50%]\n    */\n    font-size: 3.75vw; \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The sizing is still based off viewport, but is in essence set up based off the container size itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Should Sizing of the Container Change Dynamically...</h2>\n\n<p>If sizing of the container element ended up changing dynamically its percentage relationship either via <code>@media</code> break points or via javascript, then whatever the base \"target\" was would need recalculation to maintain the same \"relationship\" for text sizing.</p>\n\n<p>Take Example #1 above. If the <code>div</code> was switched to <code>25%</code> width by either <code>@media</code> or javascript, then at the same time, the <code>font-size</code> would need to adjust in either the media query or by javascript to the new calculation of <code>5vw * .25 = 1.25</code>. This would put the text size at the same size it would have been had the \"width\" of the original <code>50%</code> container been reduced by half from viewport sizing, but has now been reduced due to a change in its own percentage calculation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc\">the CSS3 <code>calc()</code> function</a> in use, it would become difficult to adjust dynamically, as that function does not work for <code>font-size</code> purposes at this time. So you could not do a pure CSS3 adjustment if your width is changing on <code>calc()</code>. Of course, a minor adjustment of width for margins may not be enough to warrant any change in <code>font-size</code>, so it may not matter.</p>\n", "title": "Font scaling based on width of container", "answer_id": 19818026, "question_id": 16056591, "tags": ["css", "responsive-design", "font-size"]}, {"body": "<p>Have you tried <a href=\"http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://simplefocus.com/flowtype/</a> ?</p>\n\n<p>This is what I use for my sites and has worked perfectly.

So the trick is to just make an iframe whose width is the maximum width you want your text to be, and whose height is equal to the maximum height * the particular text's aspect ratio. </p>\n\n<p>Setting aside the limitation that viewport units can't also come along side parent units for text (as in, having the % size behave like everyone else), viewport units do provide a very powerful tool:being able to get the min/max dimension. You can't do that anywhere else - you can't say..make the height of this div be the width of the parent * something. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, the trick is to use vmin, and to set the iframe size so that [fraction] * total height is a good font size when the height is the limiting dimension, and [fraction] * total width when the width is the limiting dimension.

Calculating them with hand would take plenty of time and at least take lots of bandwith so it's not a good answer.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>I wonder why no-one has figured this out and some people are even telling that this would be impossible to tinker with CSS. I don't like to use Javascript in adjusting elements, so I don't accept JS or even jQuery answers without digging more. All in all, it's good that this got figured out and this is one step to pure-CSS implementations in website design. </p>\n\n<p>I apologize of any unusual convention in my text, I'm not native speaker in english and also quite new to writing SO answers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: it should also be noted that we have evil scrollbars in some browsers.

In addition, <code>pull</code> makes it easy to not think about how your changes might be affected by incoming changes.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>git pull</code> command is safe so long as it only performs fast-forward merges.  If <code>git pull</code> is configured to only do fast-forward merges and a fast-forward merge isn't possible, then Git will exit with an error.  This will give you an opportunity to study the incoming commits, think about how they might affect your local commits, and decide the best course of action (merge, rebase, reset, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>With Git 2.0 and newer, you can run:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global pull.ff only\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to alter the default behavior to only fast-forward.

Several recent changes to Git have made it easier to use <code>git pull</code> properly, but unfortunately the default behavior of a plain <code>git pull</code> has several problems:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>it introduces unnecessary nonlinearities in the history</li>\n<li>it makes it easy to accidentally reintroduce commits that were intentionally rebased out upstream</li>\n<li>it modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways</li>\n<li>pausing what you are doing to review someone else's work is annoying with <code>git pull</code></li>\n<li>it makes it hard to correctly rebase onto the remote branch</li>\n<li>it doesn't clean up branches that were deleted in the remote repo</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These problems are described in greater detail below.</p>\n\n<h3>Nonlinear History</h3>\n\n<p>By default, the <code>git pull</code> command is equivalent to running <code>git fetch</code> followed by <code>git merge @{u}</code>. If there are unpushed commits in the local repository, the merge part of <code>git pull</code> creates a merge commit.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing inherently bad about merge commits, but they can be dangerous and should be treated with respect:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Merge commits are inherently difficult to examine.  To understand what a merge is doing, you have to understand the differences to all parents.  A conventional diff doesn't convey this multi-dimensional information well.  In contrast, a series of normal commits is easy to review.</li>\n<li>Merge conflict resolution is tricky, and mistakes often go undetected for a long time because merge commits are difficult to review.</li>\n<li>Merges can quietly supersede the effects of regular commits.  The code is no longer the sum of incremental commits, leading to misunderstandings about what actually changed.</li>\n<li>Merge commits may disrupt some continuous integration schemes (e.g., auto-build only the first-parent path under the assumed convention that second parents point to incomplete works in progress).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course there is a time and a place for merges, but understanding when merges should and should not be used can improve the usefulness of your repository.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the purpose of Git is to make it easy to share and consume the evolution of a codebase, not to precisely record history exactly as it unfolded.  (If you disagree, consider the <code>rebase</code> command and why it was created.)  The merge commits created by <code>git pull</code> do not convey useful semantics to others\u2014they just say that someone else happened to push to the repository before you were done with your changes.  Why have those merge commits if they aren't meaningful to others and could be dangerous?</p>\n\n<p>It is possible to configure <code>git pull</code> to rebase instead of merge, but this also has problems (discussed later).  Instead, <code>git pull</code> should be configured to only do fast-forward merges.</p>\n\n<h3>Reintroduction of Rebased-out Commits</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose someone rebases a branch and force pushes it.  This generally shouldn't happen, but it's sometimes necessary (e.g., to remove a 50GiB log file that was accidentally comitted and pushed).  The merge done by <code>git pull</code> will merge the new version of the upstream branch into the old version that still exists in your local repository.  If you push the result, pitch forks and torches will start coming your way.</p>\n\n<p>Some may argue that the real problem is force updates.  Yes, it's generally advisable to avoid force pushes whenever possible, but they are sometimes unavoidable.  Developers must be prepared to deal with force updates, because they will happen sometimes.  This means not blindly merging in the old commits via an ordinary <code>git pull</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Surprise Working Directory Modifications</h3>\n\n<p>There's no way to predict what the working directory or index will look like until <code>git pull</code> is done.  There might be merge conflicts that you have to resolve before you can do anything else, it might introduce a 50GiB log file in your working directory because someone accidentally pushed it, it might rename a directory you are working in, etc.</p>\n\n<p><code>git remote update -p</code> (or <code>git fetch --all -p</code>) allows you to look at other people's commits before you decide to merge or rebase, allowing you to form a plan before taking action.</p>\n\n<h3>Difficulty Reviewing Other People's Commits</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose you are in the middle of making some changes and someone else wants you to review some commits they just pushed.  <code>git pull</code>'s merge (or rebase) operation modifies the working directory and index, which means your working directory and index must be clean.</p>\n\n<p>You could use <code>git stash</code> and then <code>git pull</code>, but what do you do when you're done reviewing?  To get back to where you were you have to undo the merge created by <code>git pull</code> and apply the stash.</p>\n\n<p><code>git remote update -p</code> (or <code>git fetch --all -p</code>) doesn't modify the working directory or index, so it's safe to run at any time&mdash;even if you have staged and/or unstaged changes.  You can pause what you're doing and review someone else's commit without worrying about stashing or finishing up the commit you're working on. <code>git pull</code> doesn't give you that flexibility.</p>\n\n<h3>Rebasing onto a Remote Branch</h3>\n\n<p>A common Git usage pattern is to do a <code>git pull</code> to bring in the latest changes followed by a <code>git rebase @{u}</code> to eliminate the merge commit that <code>git pull</code> introduced.  It's common enough that Git has some configuration options to reduce these two steps to a single step by telling <code>git pull</code> to perform a rebase instead of a merge (see the <code>branch.&lt;branch&gt;.rebase</code>, <code>branch.autosetuprebase</code>, and <code>pull.rebase</code> options).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if you have an unpushed merge commit that you want to preserve (e.g., a commit merging a pushed feature branch into <code>master</code>), neither a rebase-pull (<code>git pull</code> with <code>branch.&lt;branch&gt;.rebase</code> set to <code>true</code>) nor a merge-pull (the default <code>git pull</code> behavior) followed by a rebase will work.  This is because <code>git rebase</code> eliminates merges (it linearizes the DAG) without the <code>--preserve-merges</code> option.  The rebase-pull operation can't be configured to preserve merges, and a merge-pull followed by a <code>git rebase -p @{u}</code> won't eliminate the merge caused by the merge-pull.  <strong>Update:</strong>  Git v1.8.5 added <code>git pull --rebase=preserve</code> and <code>git config pull.rebase preserve</code>.  These cause <code>git pull</code> to do <code>git rebase --preserve-merges</code> after fetching the upstream commits.  (Thanks to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/985627/funkaster\">funkaster</a> for the heads-up!)</p>\n\n<h3>Cleaning Up Deleted Branches</h3>\n\n<p><code>git pull</code> doesn't prune remote tracking branches corresponding to branches that were deleted from the remote repository.  For example, if someone deletes branch <code>foo</code> from the remote repo, you'll still see <code>origin/foo</code>.</p>\n\n<p>This leads to users accidentally resurrecting killed branches because they think they're still active.</p>\n\n<h2>A Better Alternative:  Use <code>git up</code> instead of <code>git pull</code></h2>\n\n<p>Instead of <code>git pull</code>, I recommend creating and using the following <code>git up</code> alias:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global alias.up '!git remote update -p; git merge --ff-only @{u}'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This alias downloads all of the latest commits from all upstream branches (pruning the dead branches) and tries to fast-forward the local branch to the latest commit on the upstream branch.  If successful, then there were no local commits, so there was no risk of merge conflict.  The fast-forward will fail if there are local (unpushed) commits, giving you an opportunity to review the upstream commits before taking action.</p>\n\n<p>This still modifies your working directory in unpredictable ways, but only if you don't have any local changes.  Unlike <code>git pull</code>, <code>git up</code> will never drop you to a prompt expecting you to fix a merge conflict.</p>\n\n<h3>Another Option: <code>git pull --ff-only --all -p</code></h3>\n\n<p>The following is an alternative to the above <code>git up</code> alias:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global alias.up 'pull --ff-only --all -p'\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This version of <code>git up</code> has the same behavior as the previous <code>git up</code> alias, except:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the error message is a bit more cryptic if your local branch isn't configured with an upstream branch</li>\n<li>it relies on an undocumented feature (the <code>-p</code> argument, which is passed to <code>fetch</code>) that may change in future versions of Git</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>If you are running Git 2.0 or newer</h3>\n\n<p>With Git 2.0 and newer you can configure <code>git pull</code> to only do fast-forward merges by default:</p>\n\n<pre><code>git config --global pull.ff only\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This causes <code>git pull</code> to act like <code>git pull --ff-only</code>, but it still doesn't fetch all upstream commits or clean out old <code>origin/*</code> branches so I still prefer <code>git up</code>.</p>\n", "title": "In what cases could `git pull` be harmful?", "answer_id": 15316602, "question_id": 15316601, "tags": ["git", "git-pull"]}, {"body": "<p>My answer, pulled from the discussion that <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7385087\">arose</a> on HackerNews:</p>\n\n<p>I feel tempted to just answer the question using the Betteridge Law of Headlines: Why is <code>git pull</code> considered harmful?

Note that the term <em>fully qualified classname</em> is standard Java terminology ... not something I just made up to confuse you :-)</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of what a <code>java</code> command should look like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    java -Xmx100m com.acme.example.ListUsers fred joe bert\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The above is going to cause the <code>java</code> command to do the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Search for the compiled version of the <code>com.acme.example.ListUsers</code> class.</li>\n<li>Load the class.</li>\n<li>Check that the class has a <code>main</code> method with signature + modifiers <code>public static void main(String[])</code>.</li>\n<li>Call that method passing it the command line arguments (\"fred\", \"joe\", \"bert\") as a <code>String[]</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Reasons why Java cannot find the class</h2>\n\n<p>When you get the message \"Could not find or load main class ...\", that means that the first step has failed.  The <code>java</code> command was not able to find the class.  And indeed, the \"...\" in the message will be the <em>fully qualified class name</em> that <code>java</code> is looking for. </p>\n\n<p>So why might it be unable to find the class?  Basically, there are two main causes:</p>\n\n<p>The first likely cause is that you may have provided the wrong class name.  (Or ... the right class name, but in the wrong form.)   Considering the example above, here a variety of <strong>wrong ways</strong> to specify the class name:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Example #1 - a simple class name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java ListUser\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the class is declared in a package such as <code>com.acme.example</code>, then you must use the full classname <em>including</em> the package name in the <code>java</code> command; e.g. </p>\n\n<pre><code>java com.acme.example.ListUser\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Example #2 - a filename or pathname rather than a class name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java ListUser.class\njava com/acme/example/ListUser.class\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Example #3 - a class name with the casing incorrect:</p>\n\n<pre><code>java com.acme.example.listuser\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Example #4 - a typo</p>\n\n<pre><code>java com.acme.example.mistuser\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The second likely cause is that the class name is correct, but that the <code>java</code> command cannot find the class.  To understand this, you need to understand the concept of the \"classpath\".  This is explained <em>well</em> by the Oracle documentation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html\">The <code>java</code> command documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/classpath.html\">Setting the Classpath</a>. </li>\n<li>The Java Tutorial - <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html\">PATH and CLASSPATH</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So ... if you have specified the class name correctly, the next thing to check is that you have specified the classpath correctly:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Read the three documents linked above.  (Yes ... READ them.  It is important that a Java programmer <em>understands</em> at least the basics of how the Java classpath mechanisms works.)</li>\n<li>Look at command line and / or the CLASSPATH environment variable that is in effect when you run the <code>java</code> command.  Check that the directory names and JAR file names are correct.</li>\n<li>If there are <em>relative</em> pathnames in the classpath, check that they resolve correctly ... from the current directory that is in effect when you run the <code>java</code> command.</li>\n<li>Check that the class (mentioned in the error message) can be located on the <em>effective</em> classpath.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Additional Notes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>When you put a directory on the classpath, it notionally corresponds to the root of the qualified name space.  Classes are located in the directory structure beneath that root, <em>by mapping the fully qualified name to a pathname</em>.  So for example, if \"/usr/local/acme/classes\" is on the class path, then when the JVM looks for a class called <code>com.acme.example.Foon</code>, it will look for a \".class\" file with this pathname:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    /usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example/Foon.class\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you had put \"/usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example\" on the classpath, then the JVM wouldn't be able to find the class.</p></li>\n<li><p>The classpath needs to include all of the <em>other</em> (non-system) classes that your application depends on.  (The system classes are located automatically, and you rarely need to concern yourself with this.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>The <code>java -jar &lt;jar file&gt;</code> syntax</h2>\n\n<p>The alternative syntax used for \"executable\" JAR files is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    java [ &lt;option&gt; ... ] -jar &lt;jar-file-name&gt; [&lt;argument&gt; ...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>e.g.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    java -Xmx100m -jar /usr/local/acme-example/listuser.jar fred\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this case the name of the entry-point class (i.e. <code>com.acme.example.ListUser</code>) and the classpath are specified in the MANIFEST of the JAR file.</p>\n\n<h2>IDEs</h2>\n\n<p>A typical Java IDE has support for running Java applications in the IDE JVM itself or in a child JVM.  These are <em>generally</em> immune from this particular exception, because the IDE uses its own mechanisms to construct the runtime classpath, identify the main class and create the <code>java</code> command line.</p>\n\n<p>However it is still possible for this exception to occur, if you do things behind the back of the IDE to break things.  For example, if you have previously set up an Application Launcher for your Java app in Eclipse, and you then moved the JAR file containing the \"main\" class to a different place in the file system <em>without telling Eclipse</em>, Eclipse would unwittingly launch the JVM with an incorrect classpath.</p>\n\n<p>In short, if you get this problem in an IDE, check for things like stale IDE state, broken project references or broken launcher configurations.</p>\n\n<h2>Other References</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>From the Oracle Java Tutorials - <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/problems/index.html\">Common Problems (and Their Solutions)</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "title": "What does &quot;Could not find or load main class&quot; mean?", "answer_id": 18093929, "question_id": 18093928, "tags": ["java", "class", "main"]}, {"body": "<p>Sometimes what might be causing the issue has nothing to do with the main class.

In fact, the issue is the same as described in the previous point, just a little bit harder to debug. </p>\n\n<p>This issue is a matter of precedence. When you set the config in your Rails app, the value is not immediately assigned to the I18n gem. Rails stores each config in an internal object, loads the dependencies (Railties and third party gems) and then it passes the configuration to the target classes. If you use a gem (or Rails plugin) that calls any of the I18n methods before the config is assigned to I18n, then you'll get the warning.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, you need to skip the Rails stack and set the config immediately to the I18n gem by calling</p>\n\n<pre><code>I18n.config.enforce_available_locales = true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>instead of</p>\n\n<pre><code>config.i18n.enforce_available_locales = true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The issue is easy to prove.

Do they mean the same across all major operating systems?", "tags": ["linux", "windows", "sockets", "unix", "portability"], "answers": [{"body": "<p>Welcome to the wonderful world of portability... or rather the lack of it. Before we start analyzing these two options in detail and take a deeper look how different operating systems handle them, it should be noted that the BSD socket implementation is the mother of all socket implementations. Basically all other systems copied the BSD socket implementation at some point of time (or at least its interfaces) and then started to evolving it on their own. Of course the BSD socket implementation was evolved as well at the same time and thus systems that copied it later got features that were lacking in systems that copied it earlier. Understanding the BSD socket implementation is the key to understanding all other socket implementations, so you should read about it even if you don't care to ever write code for a BSD system.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of basics you should know before we look at these two options. A TCP/UDP connection is identified by a tuple of five values:</p>\n\n<p><code>{&lt;protocol&gt;, &lt;src addr&gt;, &lt;src port&gt;, &lt;dest addr&gt;, &lt;dest port&gt;}</code></p>\n\n<p>Any unique combination of these values identifies a connection. As a result, no two connections can have the same five values, otherwise the system would not be able to distinguish these connections any longer.</p>\n\n<p>The protocol of a socket is set when a socket is created with the <code>socket()</code> function. The source address and port are set with the <code>bind()</code> function. The destination address and port are set with the <code>connect()</code> function. Since UDP is a connectionless protocol, UDP sockets can be used without connecting them. Yet it is allowed to connect them and in some cases very advantageous for your code and general application design. In connectionless mode, UDP sockets that were not explicitly bound when data is sent over them for the first time are usually automatically bound by the system, as an unbound UDP socket cannot receive any (reply) data. Same is true for an unbound TCP socket, it is automatically bound before it will be connected.</p>\n\n<p>If you explicitly bind a socket, it is possible to bind it to port <code>0</code>, which means \"any port\". Since a socket cannot really be bound to all existing ports, the system will have to choose a specific port itself in that case (usually from a predefined, OS specific range of source ports). A similar wildcard exists for the source address, which can be \"any address\" (<code>0.0.0.0</code> in case of IPv4 and <code>::</code> in case of IPv6). Unlike in case of ports, a socket can really be bound to \"any address\" which means \"all source IP addresses of all local interfaces\". If the socket is connected later on, the system has to choose a specific source IP address, since a socket cannot be connected and at the same time be bound to any local IP address. Depending on the destination address and the content of the routing table, the system will pick an appropriate source address and replace the \"any\" binding with a binding to the chosen source IP address.</p>\n\n<p>By default, no two sockets can be bound to the same combination of source address and source port. As long as the source port is different, the source address is actually irrelevant. Binding <code>socketA</code> to <code>A:X</code> and <code>socketB</code> to <code>B:Y</code>, where <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are addresses and <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are ports, is always possible as long as <code>X != Y</code> holds true. However, even if <code>X == Y</code>, the binding is still possible as long as <code>A != B</code> holds true. E.g. <code>socketA</code> belongs to a FTP server program and is bound to <code>192.168.0.1:21</code> and <code>socketB</code> belongs to another FTP server program and is bound to <code>10.0.0.1:21</code>, both bindings will succeed. Keep in mind, though, that a socket may be locally bound to \"any address\". If a socket is bound to <code>0.0.0.0:21</code>, it is bound to all existing local addresses at the same time and in that case no other socket can be bound to port <code>21</code>, regardless which specific IP address it tries to bind to, as <code>0.0.0.0</code> conflicts with all existing local IP addresses.</p>\n\n<p>Anything said so far is pretty much equal for all major operating system. Things start to get OS specific when address reuse comes into play. We start with BSD, since as I said above, it is the mother of all socket implementations.</p>\n\n<h1>BSD</h1>\n\n<h2>SO_REUSEADDR</h2>\n\n<p>If <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is enabled on a socket prior to binding it, the socket can be successfully bound unless there is a conflict with another socket bound to <strong>exactly</strong> the same combination of source address and port. Now you may wonder how is that any different than before? The keyword is \"exactly\". <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> mainly changes the way how wildcard addresses (\"any IP address\") are treated when searching for conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>Without <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, binding <code>socketA</code> to <code>0.0.0.0:21</code> and then binding <code>socketB</code> to <code>192.168.0.1:21</code> will fail (with error <code>EADDRINUSE</code>), since 0.0.0.0 means \"any local IP address\", thus all local IP addresses are considered in use by this socket and this includes <code>192.168.0.1</code>, too. With <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will succeed, since <code>0.0.0.0</code> and <code>192.168.0.1</code> are <strong>not exactly</strong> the same address, one is a wildcard for all local addresses and the other one is a very specific local address. Note that the statement above is true regardless in which order <code>socketA</code> and <code>socketB</code> are bound; without <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will always fail, with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> it will always succeed.</p>\n\n<p>To give you a better overview, let's make a table here and list all possible combinations:</p>\n\n<pre>\nSO_REUSEADDR       socketA        socketB       Result\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n  ON/OFF       192.168.0.1:21   192.168.0.1:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n  ON/OFF       192.168.0.1:21      10.0.0.1:21    OK\n  ON/OFF          10.0.0.1:21   192.168.0.1:21    OK\n   OFF             0.0.0.0:21   192.168.1.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n   OFF         192.168.1.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n   ON              0.0.0.0:21   192.168.1.0:21    OK\n   ON          192.168.1.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    OK\n  ON/OFF           0.0.0.0:21       0.0.0.0:21    Error (EADDRINUSE)\n</pre>\n\n<p>The table above assumes that <code>socketA</code> has already been successfully bound to the address given for <code>socketA</code>, then <code>socketB</code> is created, either gets <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set or not, and finally is bound to the address given for <code>socketB</code>. <code>Result</code> is the result of the bind operation for <code>socketB</code>. If the first column says <code>ON/OFF</code>, the value of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is irrelevant to the result.</p>\n\n<p>Okay, <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> has an effect on wildcard addresses, good to know. Yet that isn't it's only effect it has. There is another well known effect which is also the reason why most people use <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> in server programs in the first place. For the other important use of this option we have to take a deeper look on how the TCP protocol works.</p>\n\n<p>A socket has a send buffer and if a call to the <code>send()</code> function succeeds, it does not mean that the requested data has actually really been sent out, it only means the data has been added to the send buffer. For UDP sockets, the data is usually sent pretty soon, if not immediately, but for TCP sockets, there can be a relatively long delay between adding data to the send buffer and having the TCP implementation really send that data. As a result, when you close a TCP socket, there may still be pending data in the send buffer, which has not been sent yet but your code considers it as sent, since the <code>send()</code> call succeeded. If the TCP implementation was closing the socket immediately on your request, all of this data would be lost and your code wouldn't even know about that. TCP is said to be a reliable protocol and losing data just like that is not very reliable. That's why a socket that still has data to send will go into a state called <code>TIME_WAIT</code> when you close it. In that state it will wait until all pending data has been successfully sent or until a timeout is hit, in which case the socket is closed forcefully.</p>\n\n<p>The amount of time the kernel will wait before it closes the socket, regardless if it still has pending send data or not, is called the <em>Linger Time</em>. The <em>Linger Time</em> is globally configurable on most systems and by default rather long (two minutes is a common value you will find on many systems). It is also configurable per socket using the socket option <code>SO_LINGER</code> which can be used to make the timeout shorter or longer, and even to disable it completely. Disabling it completely is a very bad idea, though, since closing a TCP socket gracefully is a slightly complex process and involves sending forth and back a couple of packets (as well as resending those packets in case they got lost) and this whole close process is also limited by the <em>Linger Time</em>. If you disable lingering, your socket may not only lose pending data, it is also always closed forcefully instead of gracefully, which is usually not recommended. The details about how a TCP connection is closed gracefully are beyond the scope of this answer, if you want to learn more about, I recommend you have a look at <a href=\"http://www.freesoft.org/CIE/Course/Section4/11.htm\">this page</a>. And even if you disabled lingering with <code>SO_LINGER</code>, if your process dies without explicitly closing the socket, BSD (and possibly other systems) will linger nonetheless, ignoring what you have configured. This will happen for example if your code just calls <code>exit()</code> (pretty common for tiny, simple server programs) or the process is killed by a signal (which includes the possibility that it simply crashes because of an illegal memory access). So there is nothing you can do to make sure a socket will never linger under all circumstances. </p>\n\n<p>The question is, how does the system treat a socket in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code>? If <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is not set, a socket in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code> is considered to still be bound to the source address and port and any attempt to bind a new socket to the same address and port will fail until the socket has really been closed, which may take as long as the configured <em>Linger Time</em>. So don't expect that you can rebind the source address of a socket immediately after closing it. In most cases this will fail. However, if <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> is set for the socket you are trying to bind, another socket bound to the same address and port in state <code>TIME_WAIT</code> is simply ignored, after all its already \"half dead\", and your socket can bind to exactly the same address without any problem. In that case it plays no role that the other socket may have exactly the same address and port. Note that binding a socket to exactly the same address and port as a dying socket in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state can have unexpected, and usually undesired, side effects in case the other socket is still \"at work\", but that is beyond the scope of this answer and fortunately those side effects are rather rare in practice.</p>\n\n<p>There is one final thing you should know about <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>. Everything written above will work as long as the socket you want to bind to has address reuse enabled. It is not necessary that the other socket, the one which is already bound or is in a <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state, also had this flag set when it was bound. The code that decides if the bind will succeed or fail only inspects the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> flag of the socket fed into the <code>bind()</code> call, for all other sockets inspected, this flag is not even looked at.</p>\n\n<h2>SO_REUSEPORT</h2>\n\n<p><code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> is what most people would expect <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> to be. Basically, <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> allows you to bind an arbitrary number of sockets to <strong>exactly</strong> the same source address and port as long as <strong>all</strong> prior bound sockets also had <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set before they were bound. If the first socket that is bound to an address and port does not have <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set, no other socket can be bound to exactly the same address and port, regardless if this other socket has <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set or not, until the first socket releases its binding again. Unlike in case of <code>SO_REUESADDR</code> the code handling <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> will not only verify that the currently bound socket has <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set but it will also verify that the socket with a conflicting address and port had <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set when it was bound.</p>\n\n<p><code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> does not imply <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>. This means if a socket did not have <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set when it was bound and another socket has <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> set when it is bound to exactly the same address and port, the bind fails, which is expected, but it also fails if the other socket is already dying and is in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state. To be able bind a socket to the same addresses and port as another socket in <code>TIME_WAIT</code> state requires either <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> to be set on that socket or <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> must have been set <strong>on both</strong> sockets prior to binding them. Of course it is allowed to set both, <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> and <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, on a socket.</p>\n\n<p>There is not much more to say about <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> other than that it was added later than <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, that's why you will not find it in many socket implementations of other systems, which \"forked\" the BSD code before this option was added, and that there was no way to bind two sockets to exactly the same socket address in BSD prior to this option.</p>\n\n<h2>Connect() Returning EADDRINUSE?</h2>\n\n<p>Most people know that <code>bind()</code> may fail with the error <code>EADDRINUSE</code>, however, when you start playing around with address reuse, you may run into the strange situation that <code>connect()</code> fails with that error as well. How can this be? How can a remote address, after all that's what connect adds to a socket, be already in use? Connecting multiple sockets to exactly the same remote address has never been a problem before, so what's going wrong here?</p>\n\n<p>As I said on the very top of my reply, a connection is defined by a tuple of five values, remember? And I also said, that these five values must be unique otherwise the system cannot distinguish two connections any longer, right? Well, with address reuse, you can bind two sockets of the same protocol to the same source address and port. That means three of those five values are already the same for these two sockets. If you now try to connect both of these sockets also to the same destination address and port, you would create two connected sockets, whose tuples are absolutely identical. This cannot work, at least not for TCP connections (UDP connections are no real connections anyway). If data arrived for either one of the two connections, the system could not tell which connection the data belongs to. At least the destination address or destination port must be different for either connection, so that the system has no problem to identify to which connection incoming data belongs to.</p>\n\n<p>So if you bind two sockets of the same protocol to the same source address and port and try to connect them both to the same destination address and port, <code>connect()</code> will actually fail with the error <code>EADDRINUSE</code> for the second socket you try to connect, which means that a socket with an identical tuple of five values is already connected.</p>\n\n<h2>Multicast Addresses</h2>\n\n<p>Most people ignore the fact that multicast addresses exist, but they do exist. While unicast addresses are used for one-to-one communication, multicast addresses are used for one-to-many communication. Most people got aware of multicast addresses when they learned about IPv6 but multicast addresses also existed in IPv4, even though this feature was never widely used on the public Internet.</p>\n\n<p>The meaning of <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> changes for multicast addresses as it allows multiple sockets to be bound to exactly the same combination of source multicast address and port. In other words, for multicast addresses <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> behaves exactly as <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> for unicast addresses. Actually the code treats <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> and <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> identically for multicast addresses, that means you could say that <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> implies <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> for all multicast addresses and the other way round.</p>\n\n<h1><br>FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD</h1>\n\n<p>All these are rather late forks of the original BSD code, that's why they all three offer the same options as BSD and they also behave the same way as in BSD.</p>\n\n<h1><br>MacOS X</h1>\n\n<p>At its very core, MacOS X is simply a BSD-style UNIX, based on a rather late fork of the BSD code, which was even synchronized with FreeBSD 5 for the Mac OS 10.3 release. That's why MacOS X offers the same options as BSD and they also behave the same way as in BSD.</p>\n\n<h1><br>iOS</h1>\n\n<p>iOS is just modified MacOS X at its core, so everything that applies to MacOS X also applies to iOS.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Linux</h1>\n\n<p>Prior to Linux 3.9, only the option <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> existed. This option behaves generally the same as in BSD with two important exceptions. One exception is that if a listening (server) TCP socket is already bound to a wildcard IP address and a specific port, no other TCP socket can be bound to the same port, regardless whether either one or both sockets have this flag set. Not even if it would use a more specific address (as is allowed in case of BSD). This restriction does not apply to non-listening (client) TCP sockets and it is also possible to first bind a listening TCP socket to a specific IP address and port combination and later on bind another one to a wildcard IP address and the same port. The second exception is that for UDP sockets this option behaves exactly like <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> in BSD, so two UDP sockets can be bound to exactly the same address and port combination as long as both had this flag set before they were bound.</p>\n\n<p>Linux 3.9 added the option <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> to Linux as well. This option allows two (or more) sockets, TCP or UDP, listening (server) or non-listening (client), to be bound to exactly the same address and port combination as long as all sockets (including the very first one) had this flag set prior to binding them. To prevent \"port hijacking\", there is one special limitation, though: All sockets that want to share the same address and port combination must belong to processes that share the same effective user ID! So one user cannot \"steal\" ports of another user. Additionally the kernel performs some \"special magic\" for <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> sockets that isn't found in any other operating system so far: For UDP sockets, it tries to distribute datagrams evenly, for TCP listening sockets, it tries to distribute incoming connect requests (those accepted by calling <code>accept()</code>)  evenly across all the sockets that share the same address and port combination. That means while it is more or less random which socket receives a datagram or connect request in other operating systems that allow full address reuse, Linux tries to optimize distribution so that, for example, multiple instances of a simple server process can easily use <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> sockets to achieve a kind of simple load balancing and that absolutely for free as the kernel is doing \"all the hard work\" for them.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Android</h1>\n\n<p>Even though the whole Android system is somewhat different from most Linux distributions, at its core works a slightly modified Linux kernel, thus everything that applies to Linux applies to Android as well.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Windows</h1>\n\n<p>Windows only knows the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> option, there is no <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>. Setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on a socket in Windows behaves like setting <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> and <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on a socket in BSD, with one exception: A socket with <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> can always bind to exactly the same source address and port as an already bound socket, <strong>even if the other socket did not have this option set when it was bound</strong>. This behavior is somewhat dangerous because it allows an application \"to steal\" the connected port of another application. Needless to say, this can have major security implications. Microsoft realized that this might be a problem and thus added another socket option <code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code>. Setting <code>SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE</code> on a socket makes sure that if the binding succeeds, the combination of source address and port is owned exclusively by this socket and no other socket can bind to them, not even if it has <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> set.</p>\n\n<h1><br>Solaris</h1>\n\n<p>Solaris is the successor of SunOS. SunOS was originally based on a fork of BSD, SunOS 5 and later was based on a fork of SVR4, however SVR4 is a merge of BSD, System V, and Xenix, so up to some degree Solaris is also a BSD fork, and a rather early one. As a result Solaris only knows <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>, there is no <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code>. The <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> behaves pretty much the same as it does in BSD. As far as I know there is no way to get the same behavior as <code>SO_REUSEPORT</code> in Solaris, that means it is not possible to bind two sockets to exactly the same address and port.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to Windows, Solaris has an option to give a socket an exclusive binding. This option is named <code>SO_EXCLBIND</code>. If this option is set on a socket prior to binding it, setting <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> on another socket has no effect if the two sockets are tested for an address conflict. E.g. if <code>socketA</code> is bound to a wildcard address and <code>socketB</code> has <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> enabled and is bound to a non-wildcard address and the same port as <code>socketA</code>, this bind will normally succeed, unless <code>socketA</code> had <code>SO_EXCLBIND</code> enabled, in which case it will fail regardless the <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code> flag of <code>socketB</code>.</p>\n", "title": "Socket options SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT, how do they differ?

In order to merge in\n  Retrofit, we have to rename our variables to make our models GSON\n  compliant, write a few simple interfaces, delete functions from the\n  old API, and modify our fragments to not use AsyncTasks. Now that we\n  have a few fragments completely converted, it\u2019s pretty painless. There\n  were some growing pains and issues that we had to overcome, but\n  overall it went smoothly. In the beginning, we ran into a few\n  technical issues/bugs, but Square has a fantastic Google+ community\n  that was able to help us through it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When to use Volley?! </p>\n\n<p>We can use Volley when we need both image loading and REST API  is needed!, network call queuing system is needed for many n/w request at the same time! <strong><em>also Volley have better memory error handling than Retrofit!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>OkHttp</strong> can be used with Volley, in Retrofit it uses OkHttp by default!

Volley is thread based and this is not the way background processing should take place on Android. Ultimately, you can dig down both libs and find that they are quite similar, but our way to do background processing is more Android oriented, it allow us, for instance, to tell users that RS is actually doing something in background, which would be hard for volley (actually it doesn't at all).</li>\n<li>RoboSpice and volley both offer nice features like prioritization, retry policies, request cancellation. But RS offers more : a more advanced caching and that's a big one, with cache management, request aggregation, more features like repluging to a pending request, dealing with cache expiry without relying on server headers, etc.</li>\n<li>RoboSpice does more outside of UI Thread : volley will deserialize your POJOs on the main thread, which is horrible to my mind. With RS your app will be more responsive. </li>\n<li>In terms of speed, we definitely need metrics. RS has gotten super fast now, but still we don't have figure to put here. Volley should theoretically be a bit faster, but RS is now massively parallel... who knows ?</li>\n<li>RoboSpice offers a large compatibility range with extensions. You can use it with okhttp, retrofit, ormlite (beta), jackson, jackson2, gson, xml serializer, google http client, spring android... Quite a lot. Volley can be used with ok http and uses gson. that's it.</li>\n<li>Volley offers more UI sugar that RS. Volley provides NetworkImageView, RS does provide a spicelist adapter. In terms of feature it's not so far, but I believe Volley is more advanced on this topic.</li>\n<li>More than 200 bugs have been solved in RoboSpice since its initial release.

That is, the entire request body has to be in memory and you cannot use an <code>OutputStream</code> to write the request body to the underlying socket, nor can you use an <code>InputStream</code> to read the response body, as basic <code>HttpURLConnection</code> does. So, Volley is a poor choice for uploading or downloading large files. Your requests and responses should be small. This is one of the biggest limitations of Volley that I have personally encountered. For what it's worth, OkHttp does have interfaces for working with streams.</p></li>\n<li><p>The lack of official documentation is annoying, although I have been able to work around that by reading the source code, which is pretty easy to follow. What is more bothersome is that, as far as I can tell, Volley has no official release versions and no Maven or Gradle artifact, and therefore managing it as a dependency becomes more of a headache than, say, any of the libraries Square has released. You just clone a repo, build a jar, and you're on your own. Looking for a bug fix? Fetch and hope it's there. You might get some other stuff, too; it won't be documented. In my opinion, this effectively means that Volley is an unsupported 3rd party library, even though the code base is reasonably active. Caveat emptor.</p></li>\n<li><p>As a nit, having the Content-Type tied to the class/request type (JsonObjectRequest, ImageRequest, etc.) is kind of awkward and reduces the flexibility of the calling code a bit, as you are tied to Volley's existing Request type hierarchy. I like the straightforwardness of just setting Content-Type as a header like any other (don't do this with Volley, by the way; you'll end up with two Content-Type headers!). That's just my personal opinion, though, and it can be worked around.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That is not to say that Volley does not have some useful features. It certainly does. Easily customizable retry policies, transparent caching, a cancellation API, and support for request scheduling and concurrent connections are great features.

Lxc implements process sandboxing, which is an important pre-requisite for portable deployment, but that alone is not enough for portable deployment. If you sent me a copy of your application installed in a custom lxc configuration, it would almost certainly not run on my machine the way it does on yours, because it is tied to your machine's specific configuration: networking, storage, logging, distro, etc. Docker defines an abstraction for these machine-specific settings, so that the exact same docker container can run - unchanged - on many different  machines, with many different configurations.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Application-centric.</em> Docker is optimized for the deployment of <em>applications</em>, as opposed to machines. This is reflected in its API, user interface, design philosophy and documentation. By contrast, the lxc helper scripts focus on containers as lightweight machines - basically servers that boot faster and need less ram. We think there's more to containers than just that.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Automatic build</em>. Docker includes a tool for developers to automatically assemble a container from their source code, with full control over application dependencies, build tools, packaging etc. They are free to use make, maven, chef, puppet, salt, debian packages, rpms, source tarballs, or any combination of the above, <em>regardless of the configuration of the machines</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Versioning.</em> Docker includes git-like capabilities for tracking successive versions of a container, inspecting the diff between versions, committing new versions, rolling back etc. The history also includes <em>how</em> a container was assembled and by whom, so you get full traceability from the production server all the way back to the upstream developer. Docker also implements incremental uploads and downloads, similar to \"git pull\", so new versions of a container can be transferred by only sending diffs.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Component re-use.</em> Any container can be used as an \"base image\" to create more specialized components. This can be done manually or as part of an automated build. For example you can prepare the ideal python environment, and use it as a base for 10 different applications. Your ideal postgresql setup can be re-used for all your future projects. And so on.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Sharing.</em> Docker has access to a public registry (<a href=\"https://registry.hub.docker.com/\">https://registry.hub.docker.com/</a>) where thousands of people have uploaded useful containers: anything from redis, couchdb, postgres to irc bouncers to rails app servers to hadoop to base images for various distros. The registry also includes an official \"standard library\" of useful containers maintained by the docker team. The registry itself is open-source, so anyone can deploy their own registry to store and transfer private containers, for internal server deployments for example.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Tool ecosystem.</em> Docker defines an API for automating and customizing the creation and deployment of containers. There are a huge number of tools integrating with docker to extend its capabilities. PaaS-like deployment (Dokku, Deis, Flynn), multi-node orchestration (maestro, salt, mesos, openstack nova), management dashboards (docker-ui, openstack horizon, shipyard), configuration management (chef, puppet), continuous integration (jenkins, strider, travis), etc. Docker is rapidly establishing itself as the standard for container-based tooling.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope this helps!</p>\n", "title": "What does Docker add to lxc-tools (the userspace LXC tools)?", "answer_id": 18208445, "question_id": 17989306, "tags": ["docker", "lxc"]}, {"body": "<p>Dockers use images which are build in layers.

Additionally you do not have to add libraries in the old way, using <code>@import</code> is much faster and efficient in fact. If you still look for a nice reference I will highly recommend you reading <a href=\"http://www.raywenderlich.com/49850/whats-new-in-objective-c-and-foundation-in-ios-7\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>.</p>\n", "title": "@import vs #import - iOS 7", "answer_id": 21866748, "question_id": 18947516, "tags": ["ios", "objective-c", "import", "ios7"]}, {"body": "<p>Nice answer you can find in book Learning Cocoa with Objective-C (ISBN: 978-1-491-90139-7)</p>\n\n<p>Modules are a new means of including and linking files and libraries into your projects. To understand how modules work and what benefits they have, it is important to look back into the history of Objective-C and the #import statement\nWhenever you want to include a file for use, you will generally have some code that looks like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import \"someFile.h\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or in the case of frameworks:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import &lt;SomeLibrary/SomeFile.h&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Because Objective-C is a superset of the C programming language, the #import state\u2010 ment is a minor refinement upon C\u2019s <code>#include</code> statement. The #include statement is very simple; it copies everything it finds in the included file into your code during compilation. This can sometimes cause significant problems. For example, imagine you have two header files: <code>SomeFileA.h</code> and <code>SomeFileB.h</code>; <code>SomeFileA.h</code> includes <code>SomeFileB.h</code>, and <code>SomeFileB.h</code> includes <code>SomeFileA.h</code>. This creates a loop, and can confuse the coimpiler. To deal with this, C programmers have to write guards against this type of event from occurring.</p>\n\n<p>When using <code>#import</code>, you don\u2019t need to worry about this issue or write header guards to avoid it. However, <code>#import</code> is still just a glorified copy-and-paste action, causing slow compilation time among a host of other smaller but still very dangerous issues (such as an included file overriding something you have declared elsewhere in your own code.)</p>\n\n<p>Modules are an attempt to get around this. They are no longer a copy-and-paste into source code, but a serialised representation of the included files that can be imported into your source code only when and where they\u2019re needed. By using modules, code will generally compile faster, and be safer than using either #include or <code>#import</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to the previous example of importing a framework:</p>\n\n<pre><code>#import &lt;SomeLibrary/SomeFile.h&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To import this library as a module, the code would be changed to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@import SomeLibrary;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This has the added bonus of Xcode linking the SomeLibrary framework into the project automatically. Modules also allow you to only include the components you really need into your project. For example, if you want to use the AwesomeObject component in the AwesomeLibrary framework, normally you would have to import everything just to use the one piece. However, using modules, you can just import the specific object you want to use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@import AwesomeLibrary.AwesomeObject;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For all new projects made in Xcode 5, modules are enabled by default. If you want to use modules in older projects (and you really should) they will have to be enabled in the project\u2019s build settings. Once you do that, you can use both <code>#import</code> and <code>@import</code> statements in your code together without any concern. </p>\n", "title": "@import vs #import - iOS 7", "answer_id": 24984741, "question_id": 18947516, "tags": ["ios", "objective-c", "import", "ios7"]}, {"body": "<p>It seems that since XCode 7.x a lot of warnings are coming out when enabling clang module with <code>CLANG_ENABLE_MODULES</code></p>\n\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/17921\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lots of warnings when building with Xcode 7 with 3rd party libraries</a></p>\n", "title": "@import vs #import - iOS 7", "answer_id": 33106334, "question_id": 18947516, "tags": ["ios", "objective-c", "import", "ios7"]}], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18947516/import-vs-import-ios-7", "question_id": 18947516}, {"body": "<p>I have a multi-project (~10 modules) of which building takes about 20-30 seconds each time.

The latest version is 2.10 has a huge performance boost over previous versions (see Release notes for details).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Update Gradle version\nAn easier way to accomplish this is to go to: Open Module Settings (your project) > Project Structure</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xFm0I.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/xFm0I.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In Gradle version and enter 2.10</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0XyDw.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/0XyDw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Download Gradle Release distributive from <a href=\"https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.10-all.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.10-all.zip</a>\nAnd copy it to the Gradle folder:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNm1e.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/DNm1e.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Last step is to add your discribution in Settings > Gradle</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jOrQL.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/jOrQL.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to click Apply to save changes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enable Offline mode, Gradle daemon and parallel build for the project\nOffline mode tells Gradle to ignore update-to-date checks. Gradle asks for dependencies everytime and having this option makes it just uses what is already on the machine for dependencies.\nGo to Gradle from android studio Setting and click in Offline work box.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HeBg.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/2HeBg.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Go to Compiler from android studio Setting and add \u201c\u2014 offline\u201d in command-line box and click Compile independent modules in parallel.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9cgJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/W9cgJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The next step is to enable the Gradle daemon and parallel build for your project. Parallel builds will cause your projects with multiple modules (multi-project builds in Gradle) to be built in parallel, which should make large or modular projects build faster.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vhps7.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/Vhps7.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>These settings could enabled by modifiing a file named gradle.properties in Gradle scripts directory(i.e., ~/.gradle/gradle.properties).Some of these options (e.g. Complie modules in parallel) are available from Android Studio and also enabled there by default, but putting them in the gradle.properties file will enabled them when building from the terminal and also making sure that your colleagues will use the same settings. But if you\u2019re working on a team, sometimes you can\u2019t commit this stuff.</p>\n\n<pre><code># When configured, Gradle will run in incubating parallel mode.\n# This option should only be used with decoupled projects. More details, visit org.gradle.parallel=true\n# When set to true the Gradle daemon is used to run the build. For local developer builds this is our favorite property.\n# The developer environment is optimized for speed and feedback so we nearly always run Gradle jobs with the daemon.\n org.gradle.daemon=true\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Using the daemon will make your builds startup faster as it won\u2019t have to start up the entire Gradle application every time. The Gradle Daemon is not enabled by default, but it\u2019s recommend always enabling it for developers\u2019 machines (but leaving it disabled for continuous integration servers). FAQ about this mode could be found here <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html</a>.\nThe parallel builds setting could be unsafe for some projects. The requirement is that all your modules must be decoupled or your build could fail (see <a href=\"http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:decoupled_projects</a> for details).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enable incremental dexign and tweak memory settings\nYou can speed up your builds by turning on incremental dexing. In your module\u2019s build file:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eWQwO.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/eWQwO.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Add this option to your android block:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dexOptions {\n    incremental true\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In that dexOptions block you can also specify the heap size for the dex process, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>dexOptions {\n    incremental true\n    javaMaxHeapSize \"12g\"\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Where \u201c12g\u201d is 12GB of memory. Additional information about this could be found here google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/\nYou can also configure Gradle parameters in the settings file, e.g. increase the max heap size in case you have a large project:</p>\n\n<pre><code># Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.\n# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.\n# Default value: -Xmx10248m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m\norg.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>See all list of parameters here: <a href=\"https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide_single.html#sec:gradle_configuration_properties</a> for details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Disable Antivirus\nConsider to exclude project and cache files from antivirus scanning. This is obviously a trade off with security. But if you switch between branches a lot, then antivirus will rescan files before allowing gradle process to use it, which slows build time (in particular Android Studio sync project with gradle files and indexing tasks). Measure build time and process CPU with and without antivirus enabled to see if it is related.\nI hope this helps.
