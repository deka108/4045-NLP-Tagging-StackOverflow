I used System nanoTime for measurements
As suggested in the comments, printing only System out print takes 7.8871 seconds, whereas System out print gives #code
Providing actual default implementations. Example: Iterator remove
Allowing for JDK API evolution. Example: Iterable forEach
Using String format is even slower, by an order of magnitude or so
Why is String chars a stream of ints in Java 8?
If you only need a negation of String isEmpty you can also use StringPredicates notEmpty.
The behavior of String split (which calls Pattern split) changes between Java 7 and Java 8.
Let us compare the code of Pattern split of the reference implemetation in Java 7 and Java 8.
Notice that the #code is not around the lambda expression, but rather around the whole forEach method.
