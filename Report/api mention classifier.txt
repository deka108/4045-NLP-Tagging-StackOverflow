API Mention Classifier
To do the required API Mention recognition, which is a case of NER (Named Entity Recognition), we use Stanford NER[1]. It provides an implementation of a linear chain Conditional Random Field (CRF). Using the annotated data with the IBO entity tag, we train the model to be able to recognize the structure of an API mention.
After the model is trained, we will test the model and refine as necessary on the feature and specifics of the training to achieve higher precision on the test data.
