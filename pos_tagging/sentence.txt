Changing the springloaded version in my pom.xml did the trick.
I thought I should add my two pence worth on this topic.
Recently I hit the same issue trying to upgrade an ancient app to 2.4.4.
Once it is loaded, the static initializer of class C is invoked.
What is the correct way to perform this test?
Now the main method, we printed the value of dependsOnA of class B.
This works because the .equals() contract guarantees that for any object o, o.equals(null) is always false.
How would Random.ints() be supposed to handle such a request?
Since these are Iterables, you can call the iterator() method more than once.
We wanted consistent, predictable behavior for what happens if you call iterator() twice.
