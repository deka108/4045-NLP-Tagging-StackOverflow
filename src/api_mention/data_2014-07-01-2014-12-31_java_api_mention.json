Joda-Time also offers additional mutable types like <code>MutableDateTime</code>. </p>\n\n<p>b) Furthermore: Both libraries are inspired by the design study <a href=\"http://timeandmoney.sourceforge.net/\">\"TimeAndMoney\" from Eric Evans</a> or ideas from <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/tags/domain%20driven%20design.html\">Martin Fowler about domain driven style</a> so they strive more or less for a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface\">fluent programming style</a> (although not always perfect ;-)).</p>\n\n<p>c) With both libraries we get a real calendar date type (called <code>LocalDate</code>), a real wall time type (called <code>LocalTime</code>) and the composition (called <code>LocalDateTime</code>). That is a very big win compared with old <code>java.util.Calendar</code> and <code>java.util.Date</code>.</p>\n\n<p>d) Both libraries use a method-centric approach meaning they encourage the user to use <code>getDayOfYear()</code> instead of <code>get(DAY_OF_YEAR)</code>. This causes a lot of extra methods compared with <code>java.util.Calendar</code> (although latter is not type-safe at all due to excessive use of ints).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>\n\n<p>See the other answer by @OO7 pointing to the analysis of Mikhail Vorontsov although point 3 (exception catching) is probably obsolete - see <a href=\"https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8046707\">this JDK-bug</a>. The different performance (which is in general favour of <a href=\"https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310\">JSR-310</a>) is mainly due to the fact that the internal implementation of <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/\">Joda-Time</a> always use a machine-time-like long-primitive (in milliseconds).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Null</strong></p>\n\n<p>Joda-Time often use NULL as default for system timezone, default locale, current timestamp etc. while JSR-310 almost always rejects NULL values.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Precision</strong></p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 handles <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanosecond\">nanosecond</a> precision while Joda-Time is limited to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond\">millisecond</a> precision. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Supported fields:</strong></p>\n\n<p>An overview about supported fields in Java-8 (JSR-310) is given by some classes in the temporal-package (for example <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/ChronoField.html\">ChronoField</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/WeekFields.html\">WeekFields</a>) while Joda-Time is rather weak on this area - see <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeFieldType.html\">DateTimeFieldType</a>. The biggest lack of Joda-Time is here the absence of localized week-related fields. A common feature of both field implementation design is that both are based on values of type long (no other types, not even enums).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Enum</strong></p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 offers <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html\">enums</a> like <code>DayOfWeek</code> or <code>Month</code> while Joda-Time does not offer this because it was mainly developed in years 2002-2004 before <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#J2SE_5.0_.28September_30.2C_2004.29\">Java 5</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Zone API</strong></p>\n\n<p>a) JSR-310 offers more timezone features than Joda-Time. Latter is not able to yield a programmatical access to the history of timezone offset transitions while JSR-310 is capable to do this.</p>\n\n<p>b) For your information: JSR-310 has moved its internal timezone repository to a new location and a different format. The old library folder lib/zi does not exist any more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Adjuster vs. Property</strong></p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 has introduced the <code>TemporalAdjuster</code>-interface as a formalized way to externalize temporal calculations and manipulations, especially for library or framework-writers this is a nice and relative easy way to embed new extensions of JSR-310 (a kind of equivalent to static helper classes for former <code>java.util.Date</code>).</p>\n\n<p>For most users however, this feature has very limited value because the burden to write code is still with the user. Built-in solutions based on the new <code>TemporalAdjuster</code>-concept are not so many, there is currently only the helper class <code>TemporalAdjusters</code> with a limited set of manipulations (and the enums <code>Month</code> or other temporal types). </p>\n\n<p>Joda-Time offers a field-package but practice has shown evidence that new field implementations are very hard to code. On the other side Joda-Time offers so-called properties which make some manipulations much easier and more elegant than in JSR-310, for example <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTime.Property.html#withMaximumValue()\">property.withMaximumValue()</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Calendar systems</strong></p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 offers 4 extra calendar systems. The most interesting one is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar#Saudi_Arabia.27s_Umm_al-Qura_calendar\">Umalqura</a> (used in Saudi Arabia). The other 3 are: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minguo_calendar\">Minguo</a> (Taiwan), Japanese (only the modern calendar since 1871!) and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_calendar\">ThaiBuddhist</a> (only correct after 1940).</p>\n\n<p>Joda-Time offers an <a href=\"http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/cal_islamic.html\">Islamic calendar</a> based on calculatory base - not a sighting-based calendar like Umalqura. Thai-Buddhist is also offered by Joda-Time in a similar form, Minguo and the japanese one not. Otherwise Joda-Time offers coptic and ethiopic calendar, too (but without any support for internationalization).</p>\n\n<p>More interesting for Europeans: Joda-Time also offers a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar\">Gregorian</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar\">Julian</a> and mixed-gregorian-julian calendar. However, the practical value for real historical calculations is limited because important features like different year starts in date history are not supported at all (the same criticism is valid for old <code>java.util.GregorianCalendar</code>).</p>\n\n<p>Other calendars like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar\">Hebrew</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars\">Persian</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_calendar\">Hindu</a> are completely missing in both libraries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Epoch days</strong></p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 has the class <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/JulianFields.html\">JulianFields</a> while Joda-Time (version 2.0) offers some helper methods in the class <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeUtils.html#fromJulianDay(double)\">DateTimeUtils</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clocks</strong></p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 has no interface (a design mistake) but an abstract class <code>java.time.Clock</code> which can be used for any clock dependency injection. Joda-Time offers the interface <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeUtils.MillisProvider.html\">MillisProvider</a> and some helper methods in <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/DateTimeUtils.html#setCurrentMillisProvider(org.joda.time.DateTimeUtils.MillisProvider)\">DateTimeUtils</a> instead. So this way Joda-Time is also capable of supporting test-driven models with different clocks (mocking etc.).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Duration arithmetic</strong></p>\n\n<p>Both libraries support the calculation of time distances in one or more temporal units. However, when handling single-unit-durations the JSR-310-style is obviously nicer (and long-based instead of using int):</p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 =&gt; <code>long days = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(date1, date2);</code></p>\n\n<p>Joda-Time =&gt; <code>int days = DAYS.daysBetween(date1, date2).getDays();</code></p>\n\n<p>Handling of multiple-unit-durations are also different. Even the calculation results can differ - see this closed <a href=\"https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/132\">Joda-Time issue</a>. While JSR-310 use a very simple and limited approach to use just the classes <code>Period</code> (duration based on years, months and days) and <code>Duration</code> (based on seconds and nanoseconds), Joda-Time uses a more sophisticated way using the class <code>PeriodType</code> in order to control in which units a duration (Joda-Time call it \"Period\") shall be expressed. While the <code>PeriodType</code>-API is somehow awkward to use a similar way is not offered by JSR-310 at all. Especially it is not yet possible in JSR-310 to define mixed date and time durations (based on days and hours for example). So be warned if it comes to migration from one library to another. The libraries in discussion are incompatible - despite of partially same class names.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Intervals</strong></p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 does not support this feature while Joda-Time has limited support. See also this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22150722/is-there-a-class-in-java-time-comparable-to-the-joda-time-interval/22152890#22152890\">SO-answer</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Formatting and Parsing</strong></p>\n\n<p>Best way to compare both libraries is to view the equal-named classes <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatterBuilder.html\">DateTimeFormatterBuilder</a> (JSR-310) and <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormatterBuilder.html\">DateTimeFormatterBuilder</a> (Joda-Time). The JSR-310-variant is a little bit more powerful (can also handle any kind of <code>TemporalField</code> provided the field implementor has managed to code some extension points like <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/temporal/TemporalField.html#resolve-java.util.Map-java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor-java.time.format.ResolverStyle-\">resolve()</a>). Most important difference is however - in my opinion: </p>\n\n<p>JSR-310 can much better parse timezone names (format pattern symbol z) while Joda-Time could not do this at all in its earlier versions and now only in a very limited way.</p>\n\n<p>Another advantage of JSR-310 is support for standalone month names which is important in languages like Russian or Polish etc. Joda-Time has <a href=\"https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/273\">no access to such resources</a> - not even on Java-8 platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The pattern syntax in JSR-310 is also more flexible than in Joda-Time, allows for optional sections (using square brackets), is more orientated towards CLDR-standard and offers padding (letter symbol p) and more fields.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise it should be noted that Joda-Time can format durations using <a href=\"http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/PeriodFormatter.html\">PeriodFormatter</a>. JSR-310 cannot do this.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Hope this overview helps. All the gathered information is mainly there due to my efforts and investigations how to design and implement a better date-and-time library (nothing is perfect).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update from 2015-06-24:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile I have found the time to write and <a href=\"http://time4j.net/tutorial/appendix.html\">publish a tabular overview</a> for different time libraries in Java. The tables also contain a comparison between Joda-Time v2.8.1 and Java-8 (JSR-310).

Because about half the numbers generated by the first part (before the division) are less than <code>1L &lt;&lt; 52</code>, and therefore their significand doesn't entirely fill the 53 bits that it could fill, meaning the least significant bit of the significand is always zero for those.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Because of the amount of attention this is receiving, here's some extra explanation of what a <code>double</code> in Java (and many other languages) really looks like and why it mattered in this question.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, a <code>double</code> looks like this: (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IEEE_754_Double_Floating_Point_Format.svg\">source</a>)</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://i.stack.imgur.com/lQaeV.png\" alt=\"double layout\"></p>\n\n<p>A very important detail not visible in this picture is that numbers are \"normalized\"<sup>1</sup> such that the 53 bit fraction starts with a 1 (by choosing the exponent such that it is so), that 1 is then omitted. That is why the picture shows 52 bits for the fraction (significand) but there are effectively 53 bits in it.</p>\n\n<p>The normalization means that if in the code for <code>nextDouble</code> the 53rd bit is set, that bit is the implicit leading 1 and it goes away, and the other 52 bits are copied literally to the significand of the resulting <code>double</code>. If that bit is not set however, the remaining bits must be shifted left until it becomes set.</p>\n\n<p>On average, half the generated numbers fall into the case where the significand was <em>not</em> shifted left at all (and about half those have a 0 as their least significant bit), and the other half is shifted by at least 1 (or is just completely zero) so their least significant bit is always 0.</p>\n\n<p>1: not always, clearly it cannot be done for zero, which has no highest 1.

Specifically, certain cryptographic algorithms, such as <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29\">RSA</a>, require randomly chosen large primes.  Importantly, however, these algorithms don't really require these numbers to be <em>guaranteed</em> to be prime &mdash; they just need to be prime with a <em>very</em> high probability.</p>\n\n<p>How high is very high?  Well, in a crypto application, one would typically call <code>.isProbablePrime()</code> with an argument somewhere between 128 and 256.  Thus, the probability of a non-prime number passing such a test is less than one in 2<sup>128</sup> or 2<sup>256</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's put that in perspective: if you had 10 billion computers, each generating 10 billion probable prime numbers per second (which would mean less than one clock cycle per number on any modern CPU), and the primality of those numbers was tested with <code>.isProbablePrime(128)</code>, you would, on average, expect one non-prime number to slip in <strong>once in every 100 billion years</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>That is, that would be the case, if those 10 billion computers could somehow all run for hundreds of billions of years without experiencing <em>any</em> hardware failures.  In practice, though, <strong>it's a lot more likely for a random cosmic ray to strike your computer at just the right time and place to flip the return value</strong> of <code>.isProbablePrime(128)</code> from false to true, without causing any other detectable effects, than it is for a non-prime number to actually pass the probabilistic primality test at that certainty level.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the same risk of random cosmic rays and other hardware faults also applies to deterministic primality tests like <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test\">AKS</a>.  Thus, in practice, even these tests have a (very small) baseline false positive rate due to random hardware failures (not to mention all other possible sources of errors, such as implementation bugs).</p>\n\n<p>Since it's easy to push the intrinsic false positive rate of the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test\">Miller&ndash;Rabin primality test</a> used by <code>.isProbablePrime()</code> far below this baseline rate, simply by repeating the test sufficiently many times, and since, even repeated so many times, the Miller&ndash;Rabin test is still much faster in practice than the best known deterministic primality tests like AKS, it remains the standard primality test for cryptographic applications.</p>\n\n<p>(Besides, even if you happened to accidentally select a strong pseudoprime as one of the factors of your RSA modulus, it would not generally lead to a catastrophic failure.  Typically, such pseudoprimes would be products of two (or rarely more) primes of approximately half the length, which means that you'd end up with a <a href=\"http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/11287/rsa-with-modulus-product-of-many-primes\">multi-prime RSA key</a>.  As long as none of the factors were <em>too</em> small (and if they were, the primality test should've caught them), the RSA algorithm will still work just fine, and the key, although somewhat weaker against certain types of attacks than normal RSA keys of the same length, should still be reasonably secure if you didn't needlessly skimp on the key length.)</p>\n", "title": "What is a possible use case of BigInteger&#39;s .isProbablePrime()?", "tags": ["java", "primes"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27430092/what-is-a-possible-use-case-of-bigintegers-isprobableprime/27449187#27449187", "post_type": "answer", "question_id": 27430092, "answer_id": 27449187}, {"body": "<p>OK, first of all, your <code>setExits()</code> method will not work as intended, chained if-elseif will maximally execute 1 branch of code, for example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>if (e.contains(\"N\"))\n    bexits[0] = true;\nelse if (e.contains(\"W\"))\n    bexits[1] = true;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Even if <code>e</code> contains both <code>N</code> and <code>W</code>, only <code>bexits[0]</code> will be set.

It depends on how big the returned collection will be.  It depends on whether the result changes over time, and how important consistency of the returned result is.  And it depends very much on how the user is likely to use the answer.  </p>\n\n<p>First, note that you can always get a Collection from a Stream, and vice versa:</p>\n\n<pre><code>// If API returns Collection, convert with stream()\ngetFoo().stream()...\n\n// If API returns Stream, use collect()\nCollection&lt;T&gt; c = getFooStream().collect(toList());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>So the question is, which is more useful to your callers.  </p>\n\n<p>If your result might be infinite, there's only one choice: Stream.</p>\n\n<p>If your result might be very large, you probably prefer Stream, since there may not be any value in materializing it all at once, and doing so could create significant heap pressure.</p>\n\n<p>If all the caller is going to do is iterate through it (search, filter, aggregate), you should prefer Stream, since Stream has these built-in already and there's no need to materialize a collection (especially if the user might not process the whole result.)  This is a very common case.  </p>\n\n<p>Even if you know that the user will iterate it multiple times or otherwise keep it around, you still may want to return a Stream instead, for the simple fact that whatever Collection you choose to put it in (e.g., ArrayList) may not be the form they want, and then the caller has to copy it anyway.  if you return a stream, they can do <code>collect(toCollection(factory))</code> and get it in exactly the form they want.</p>\n\n<p>The above \"prefer Stream\" cases mostly derive from the fact that Stream is more flexible; you can late-bind to how you use it without incurring the costs and constraints of materializing it to a Collection.  </p>\n\n<p>The one case where you must return a Collection is when there are strong consistency requirements, and you have to produce a consistent snapshot of a moving target.  Then, you will want put the elements into a collection that will not change.</p>\n\n<p>So I would say that most of the time, Stream is the right answer -- it is more flexible, it doesn't impose usually-unnecessary materialization costs, and can be easily turned into the Collection of your choice if needed.

See the <a href=\"http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/class-use/Stream.html\">Stream usage page</a> in the Java 8 javadoc and look for \"methods... that return Stream\" for the packages other than <code>java.util.Stream</code>. These methods are usually on classes that represent or can contain multiple values or aggregations of something. In such cases, APIs typically have returned collections or arrays of them. For all the reasons that Brian noted in his answer, it's very flexible to add Stream-returning methods here. Many of these classes have collections- or array-returning methods already, because the classes predate the Streams API. If you're designing a new API, and it makes sense to provide Stream-returning methods, it might not be necessary to add collection-returning methods as well.</p>\n\n<p>Brian mentioned the cost of \"materializing\" the values into a collection. To amplify this point, there are actually two costs here: the cost of storing values in the collection (memory allocation and copying) and also the cost of creating the values in the first place. The latter cost can often be reduced or avoided by taking advantage of a Stream's laziness-seeking behavior. A good example of this are the APIs in <code>java.nio.file.Files</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static Stream&lt;String&gt;  lines(path)\nstatic List&lt;String&gt;    readAllLines(path)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Not only does <code>readAllLines</code> have to hold the entire file contents in memory in order to store it into the result list, it also has to read the file to the very end before it returns the list. The <code>lines</code> method can return almost immediately after it has performed some setup, leaving file reading and line breaking until later when it's necessary -- or not at all. This is a huge benefit, if for example, the caller is interested only in the first ten lines:</p>\n\n<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; firstTen = Files.lines(path).limit(10).collect(toList());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Of course considerable memory space can be saved if the caller filters the stream to return only lines matching a pattern, etc.</p>\n\n<p>An idiom that seems to be emerging is to name stream-returning methods after the plural of the name of the things that it represents or contains, without a <code>get</code> prefix. Also, while <code>stream()</code> is a reasonable name for a stream-returning method when there is only one possible set of values to be returned, sometimes there are classes that have aggregations of multiple types of values.

Consider the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static &lt;X, Y, Z&gt; Map&lt;X, Z&gt; transform(Map&lt;? extends X, ? extends Y&gt; input,\n                                     Function&lt;Y, Z&gt; function) {\n    return input.keySet().stream()\n        .collect(Collectors.toMap(Function.identity(),\n                                  key -&gt; function.apply(input.get(key))));\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>A couple points here. First is the use of wildcards in the generics; this makes the function somewhat more flexible. A wildcard would be necessary if, for example, you wanted the output map to have a key that's a superclass of the input map's key:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Map&lt;String, String&gt; input = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();\ninput.put(\"string1\", \"42\");\ninput.put(\"string2\", \"41\");\nMap&lt;CharSequence, Integer&gt; output = transform(input, Integer::parseInt);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(There is also an example for the map's values, but it's really contrived, and I admit that having the bounded wildcard for Y only helps in edge cases.)</p>\n\n<p>A second point is that instead of running the stream over the input map's <code>entrySet</code>, I ran it over the <code>keySet</code>. This makes the code a little cleaner, I think, at the cost of having to fetch values out of the map instead of from the map entry. Incidentally, I initially had <code>key -&gt; key</code> as the first argument to <code>toMap()</code> and this failed with a type inference error for some reason. Changing it to <code>(X key) -&gt; key</code> worked, as did <code>Function.identity()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Still another variation is as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>static &lt;X, Y, Z&gt; Map&lt;X, Z&gt; transform1(Map&lt;? extends X, ? extends Y&gt; input,\n                                      Function&lt;Y, Z&gt; function) {\n    Map&lt;X, Z&gt; result = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    input.forEach((k, v) -&gt; result.put(k, function.apply(v)));\n    return result;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This uses <code>Map.forEach()</code> instead of streams. This is even simpler, I think, because it dispenses with the collectors, which are somewhat clumsy to use with maps. The reason is that <code>Map.forEach()</code> gives the key and value as separate parameters, whereas the stream has only one value -- and you have to choose whether to use the key or the map entry as that value. On the minus side, this lacks the rich, streamy goodness of the other approaches. :-)</p>\n", "title": "Java8: HashMap&lt;X, Y&gt; to HashMap&lt;X, Z&gt; using Stream / Map-Reduce / Collector", "tags": ["java", "mapreduce", "java-8", "java-stream", "collectors"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25903137/java8-hashmapx-y-to-hashmapx-z-using-stream-map-reduce-collector/25905196#25905196", "post_type": "answer", "question_id": 25903137, "answer_id": 25905196}, {"body": "<p>Documentation:</p>\n\n<p>For: <code>System.out.println(\"Output1: \"+blank.split(\",\").length);</code></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The array returned by this method contains each substring of this string that is terminated by another substring that matches the given expression or is terminated by the end of the string.

With a marker interface, you can require something to be of two different types, such as in a method signature. Say you have some interface Widget in your application, like we described above. If you have a method that requires a Widget that also happens to let you iterate over it (it's contrived, but work with me here), your only good solution is to create a marker interface that extends both interfaces:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface IterableWidget extends Iterable&lt;String&gt;, Widget { }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And in your code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public void doSomething(IterableWidget widget) {\n    for (String s : widget) { ... }\n}\n</code></pre>\n", "title": "Marker Interfaces in Java?", "tags": ["java", "design-patterns", "marker-interfaces"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25850328/marker-interfaces-in-java/25853827#25853827", "post_type": "answer", "question_id": 25850328, "answer_id": 25853827}, {"body": "<p>The main purpose of marker interfaces is to create special types where types themselves have no behavior of their own. </p>\n\n<pre><code>public interface MarkerEntity {\n\n}\n\npublic boolean save(Object object) throws InvalidEntityFoundException {\n   if(!(object instanceof MarkerEntity)) {\n       throw new InvalidEntityFoundException(\"Invalid Entity Found, can't be  saved);\n   } \n   return db.save(object);\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here save method makes sure that only the objects of classes that implement the MarkerEntity interface are saved, for other types InvalidEntityFoundException is thrown.

When you call a method on a mock object, Mockito records the details of the call in an internal list of invocations.  The <code>when</code> method reads the last of these invocations off the list and records this invocation in the <code>OngoingStubbing</code> object it returns.</p>\n\n<p>The line</p>\n\n<pre><code>Mockito.when(mainModel.getList()).thenReturn(someModelList);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>causes the following interactions with Mockito:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mock method <code>mainModel.getList()</code> is called,</li>\n<li>Static method <code>when</code> is called,</li>\n<li>Method <code>thenReturn</code> is called on the <code>OngoingStubbing</code> object returned by the <code>when</code> method.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The <code>thenReturn</code> method can then instruct the mock it received via the <code>OngoingStubbing</code> method to handle any suitable call to the <code>getList</code> method to return <code>someModelList</code>.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, as Mockito can't see your code, you can also write your mocking as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>mainModel.getList();\nMockito.when((List&lt;SomeModel&gt;)null).thenReturn(someModelList);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This style is somewhat less clear to read, especially since in this case the <code>null</code> has to be casted, but it generates the same sequence of interactions with Mockito and will achieve the same result as the line above.</p>\n\n<p>However, the line </p>\n\n<pre><code>Mockito.when(mainModel.getList()).thenReturn(getSomeList());\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>causes the following interactions with Mockito:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Mock method <code>mainModel.getList()</code> is called,</li>\n<li>Static method <code>when</code> is called,</li>\n<li>A new <code>mock</code> of <code>SomeModel</code> is created (inside <code>getSomeList()</code>),</li>\n<li>Mock method <code>model.getName()</code> is called,</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>At this point Mockito gets confused.  It thought you were mocking <code>mainModel.getList()</code>, but now you're telling it you want to mock the <code>model.getName()</code> method.  To Mockito, it looks like you're doing the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>when(mainModel.getList());\n// ...\nwhen(model.getName()).thenReturn(...);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This looks silly to <code>Mockito</code> as it can't be sure what you're doing with <code>mainModel.getList()</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that we did not get to the <code>thenReturn</code> method call, as the JVM needs to evaluate the parameters to this method before it can call the method.  In this case, this means calling the <code>getSomeList()</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>Generally it is a bad design decision to rely on static state, as Mockito does, because it can lead to cases where the Principle of Least Astonishment is violated.  However, Mockito's design does make for clear and expressive mocking, even if it leads to astonishment sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, recent versions of Mockito add an extra line to the error message above.

There was no once-and-for-all conclusion, so perhaps I've missed something from another list or the matter was settled in private discussion.  (Perhaps <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3553087/brian-goetz\">Brian Goetz</a>, one of the principals of this discussion, can fill in anything missing.)</p>\n\n<p>The participants made their points well, so this answer is mostly just an organization of the relevant quotes, with a few clarifications in <em>[brackets]</em>, presented in order of importance (as I interpret it).</p>\n\n<h2>parallelStream() covers a very common case</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-February/001362.html\">Brian Goetz</a> in the first thread, explaining why <code>Collections.parallelStream()</code> is valuable enough to keep even after other parallel stream factory methods have been removed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We do <em>not</em> have explicit parallel versions of each of these <em>[stream factories]</em>; we did \n  originally, and to prune down the API surface area, we cut them on the \n  theory that dropping 20+ methods from the API was worth the tradeoff of \n  the surface yuckiness and performance cost of <code>.intRange(...).parallel()</code>. \n    But we did not make that choice with Collection.</p>\n  \n  <p>We could either remove the <code>Collection.parallelStream()</code>, or we could add \n  the parallel versions of all the generators, or we could do nothing and \n  leave it as is.  I think all are justifiable on API design grounds.</p>\n  \n  <p>I kind of like the status quo, despite its inconsistency.  Instead of \n  having 2N stream construction methods, we have N+1 -- but that extra 1 \n  covers a huge number of cases, because it is inherited by every \n  Collection.  So I can justify to myself why having that extra 1 method \n  is worth it, and why accepting the inconsistency of going no further is \n  acceptable.</p>\n  \n  <p>Do others disagree?  Is N+1 <em>[Collections.parallelStream() only]</em> the practical choice here?  Or should we go \n  for the purity of N <em>[rely on Stream.parallel()]</em>?  Or the convenience and consistency of 2N <em>[parallel versions of all factories]</em>?  Or is \n  there some even better N+3 <em>[Collections.parallelStream() plus other special cases]</em>, for some other specially chosen cases we \n  want to give special support to?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-April/001799.html\">Brian Goetz</a> stands by this position in the later discussion about <code>Arrays.parallelStream()</code>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I still really like Collection.parallelStream; it has huge \n  discoverability advantages, and offers a pretty big return on API \n  surface area -- one more method, but provides value in a lot of places, \n  since Collection will be a really common case of a stream source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>parallelStream() is more performant</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-April/001799.html\">Brian Goetz</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Direct version <em>[parallelStream()]</em> is more performant, in that it requires less wrapping (to \n  turn a stream into a parallel stream, you have to first create the \n  sequential stream, then transfer ownership of its state into a new \n  Stream.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In response to Kevin Bourrillion's skepticism about whether the effect is significant, <a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-February/001346.html\">Brian again</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Depends how seriously you are counting.  Doug counts individual object \n  creations and virtual invocations on the way to a parallel operation, \n  because until you start forking, you're on the wrong side of Amdahl's \n  law -- this is all \"serial fraction\" that happens before you can fork \n  any work, which pushes your breakeven threshold further out.  So getting \n  the setup path for parallel ops fast is valuable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-February/001354.html\">Doug Lea follows up</a>, but hedges his position:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>People dealing with parallel library support need some attitude\n  adjustment about such things. On a soon-to-be-typical machine,\n  every cycle you waste setting up parallelism costs you say 64 cycles.\n  You would probably have had a different reaction if it required 64\n  object creations to start a parallel computation.</p>\n  \n  <p>That said, I'm always completely supportive of forcing implementors\n  to work harder for the sake of better APIs, so long as the\n  APIs do not rule out efficient implementation. So if killing\n  <code>parallelStream</code> is really important, we'll find some way to\n  turn <code>stream().parallel()</code> into a bit-flip or somesuch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, the later discussion about <code>Arrays.parallelStream()</code> <a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-April/001799.html\">takes notice of lower Stream.parallel() cost</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>stream().parallel() statefulness complicates the future</h2>\n\n<p>At the time of the discussion, switching a stream from sequential to parallel and back could be interleaved with other stream operations.  <a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-February/001363.html\">Brian Goetz, on behalf of Doug Lea</a>, explains why sequential/parallel mode switching may complicate future development of the Java platform:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I'll take my best stab at explaining why: because it (like the stateful \n  methods (sort, distinct, limit)) which you also don't like, move us \n  incrementally farther from being able to express stream pipelines in \n  terms of traditional data-parallel constructs, which further constrains \n  our ability to to map them directly to tomorrow's computing substrate, \n  whether that be vector processors, FPGAs, GPUs, or whatever we cook up.</p>\n  \n  <p>Filter-map-reduce map[s] very cleanly to all sorts of parallel computing \n  substrates; filter-parallel-map-sequential-sorted-limit-parallel-map-uniq-reduce \n  does not.</p>\n  \n  <p>So the whole API design here embodies many tensions between making it \n  easy to express things the user is likely to want to express, and doing \n  is in a manner that we can predictably make fast with transparent cost \n  models.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This mode switching was <a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-experts/2013-March/001504.html\">removed after further discussion</a>.  In the current version of the library, a stream pipeline is either sequential or parallel; last call to <code>sequential()</code>/<code>parallel()</code> wins.  Besides side-stepping the statefulness problem, this change also improved the performance of using <code>parallel()</code> to set up a parallel pipeline from a sequential stream factory.</p>\n\n<h2>exposing parallelStream() as a first-class citizen improves programmer perception of the library, leading them to write better code</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-February/001352.html\">Brian Goetz again</a>, in response to <a href=\"http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/lambda-libs-spec-observers/2013-April/001801.html\">Tim Peierls's argument</a> that <code>Stream.parallel()</code> allows programmers to understand streams sequentially before going parallel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have a slightly different viewpoint about the value of this sequential \n  intuition -- I view the pervasive \"sequential expectation\" as one if the \n  biggest challenges of this entire effort; people are <em>constantly</em> \n  bringing their incorrect sequential bias, which leads them to do stupid \n  things like using a one-element array as a way to \"trick\" the \"stupid\" \n  compiler into letting them capture a mutable local, or using lambdas as \n  arguments to map that mutate state that will be used during the \n  computation (in a non-thread-safe way), and then, when its pointed out \n  that what they're doing, shrug it off and say \"yeah, but I'm not doing \n  it in parallel.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>We've made a lot of design tradeoffs to merge sequential and parallel \n  streams.  The result, I believe, is a clean one and will add to the \n  library's chances of still being useful in 10+ years, but I don't \n  particularly like the idea of encouraging people to think this is a \n  sequential library with some parallel bags nailed on the side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "title": "Why does Collection.parallelStream() exist when .stream().parallel() does the same thing?", "tags": ["java", "java-8", "java-stream"], "link": "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24603186/why-does-collection-parallelstream-exist-when-stream-parallel-does-the-sa/24603187#24603187", "post_type": "answer", "question_id": 24603186, "answer_id": 24603187}, {"body": "<p>Try adding a <code>Thread.sleep(1000);</code> call within your <code>run()</code> method...
